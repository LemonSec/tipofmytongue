1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,298
so it's your my pleasure to be again on

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,979
stage today to introduce this panel as I

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,179
said already in the morning this is the

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,250
second track related to topic four

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:17,430
operations and the title is information

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,730
warfare defining and analyzing will

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:27,119
touch some something regarding social

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,900
network analysis and data analysis the

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,450
moderator for this panel is a donor

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,089
bargain and she's a this information

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,570
information warfare expert dinara

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,340
advises private and public sectors on

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,230
how to address this information through

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,930
strategic communication and digital

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,328
resiliency prior to becoming a

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,879
consultant she served as an assistant

17
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,670
director for R&D at the Atlantic

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,149
Council's digital forensic research lab

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,420
and NATO's strategic communication

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,270
center action Stratcom in the Riga so

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,530
it's my pleasure to introduce dinara

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:10,200
please this is yours thank you thank you

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:13,140
welcome to the panel on information

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,900
operations today our three exceptional

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,960
panelists will take on a gigantic task

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,330
of explaining how to best analyze

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,820
information operations and what the

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,908
latest data can tell us about the future

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,860
of information warfare we will start out

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,960
by looking at some theoretical

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,860
frameworks that will be presented to us

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,020
by Miss Alicia Barger and then explore

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,869
their applicability to real-world case

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,020
studies that will be presented by Renee

35
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,420
the Resta and major jeff nichols without

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,509
further ado let me introduce you to our

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,540
first speaker miss Alicia Barger who

38
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,630
works as a research engineer at the John

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,820
Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory where

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,908
she draws upon her background in machine

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,820
learning and social network analysis to

42
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,329
research social phenomena in the digital

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,029
domain

44
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,220
Alicia is an incoming research engineer

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,619
at grafica and today she will present

46
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,660
her li latest research paper on how

47
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,540
social network analysis can help us

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,519
analyze

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,298
and counter information operations

50
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,260
Alicia the floor is yours thank you all

51
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:25,000
right hi everyone

52
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,519
my name is Alicia Barger it's stated but

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,459
really this paper was produced alongside

54
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,409
some really time two co-authors at Johns

55
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,180
Hopkins Applied Physics lab in Accenture

56
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,480
federal so I'm really excited to present

57
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,379
to you this work in recognition of

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,420
stuffing Yanis you couldn't be here

59
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:46,268
today in a and who could be in right so

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,500
let's get started so disinformation and

61
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:51,370
information operations have become

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,980
publicly famous terms in light of recent

63
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,810
events in Europe and the United States

64
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,849
however these are issues that affects

65
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,060
countries all over the world both

66
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:05,409
internally and as a result of you know

67
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,389
well interstate in internal state so as

68
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,980
legislation is being developed by these

69
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,230
different states try and cut down on

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,638
attacks we need to think about what kind

71
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,159
of technical approaches we can develop

72
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,170
to help support the legislation in a way

73
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:21,310
this was scientifically in ethically

74
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:24,970
acceptable information operations is as

75
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,819
I discovered a difficult term to define

76
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,579
so let me clarify this here we're going

77
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:31,869
to be following NATO's definition

78
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,160
military information activities that

79
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,870
create desired effects on the will

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,849
understanding and capability of

81
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,040
adversaries potential adversaries and

82
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,629
other approved parties within this

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,599
definition I'm going to scope it more

84
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:46,179
specifically to focusing on identifying

85
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,328
covert or non-disclosed campaigns that

86
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,650
have offensive objectives that is

87
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,120
intending to create negative effect on

88
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,230
the will and understanding in particular

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,569
of others and campaigns that seek to

90
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,518
produce a behavioral psychological or

91
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:02,290
social effect so I'm going to be talking

92
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,569
here mostly about info about the

93
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,519
information the fact it has on the human

94
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:09,190
mind rather than necessarily the

95
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,889
technological equipment used to transmit

96
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,239
that information in some countries this

97
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,359
may be better characterized as

98
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,728
psychological operations alright now

99
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,320
with respect to that I do need to

100
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:22,570
clarify that there are some things that

101
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,700
make online information operations a

102
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,560
little bit distinctive from information

103
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,430
operations in the past and this is

104
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,669
because the

105
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,490
my environment produces certain

106
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:37,120
characteristics that are particularly

107
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,949
interesting this field for example it's

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,789
much easier to collaborate even if

109
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,199
you're anonymous there's a unique

110
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,180
multi-stakeholder governments model for

111
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,770
the internet and for the more the speed

112
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,699
at which information can be transmitted

113
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,460
it just it's much higher much faster

114
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,620
than in natural environments so I do

115
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,840
need to recognize these aspects in this

116
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,580
talk all right so why do I pull up on

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,929
social network analysis you're going to

118
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,070
recognize this graph but I'm going to

119
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,020
talk to you a little bit about what it

120
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,990
means social network analysis is more

121
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,840
than just circles and lines connected

122
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,900
together social network analysis is a

123
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,130
field that's existed for several decades

124
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,388
relating to understanding human behavior

125
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,099
in the light of our social relationships

126
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,380
this is interesting because if you

127
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:25,180
remember from the last slide we're

128
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,120
talking about collaboration information

129
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,740
sharing and communities that form and

130
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,889
develop so actually the research

131
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,720
questions are addressed by people in the

132
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,330
social network analysis field relate

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,020
rather interestingly to the problems

134
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,789
just that I just described now just so

135
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,049
that we are all on the same page I'm

136
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:47,530
going to try to make it clear my further

137
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,780
illustrations but the circles or nodes

138
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,609
typically represent people or people

139
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,239
like entities within social network

140
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,190
analysis that here they may refer to

141
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,009
user accounts as well and then the lines

142
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,880
represent or edges represent

143
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:05,530
relationships so this is going to be

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,370
provide the outline for the rest of my

145
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,840
talk I kind of drew upon some basic

146
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,960
policy needs trying to make them

147
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,909
abstract enough to relate to different

148
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,530
approaches but drawing upon particularly

149
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,900
European Commission high-level group

150
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,138
report in particular and then I'll be

151
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,870
focusing on aspects of social network

152
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,330
analysis that I felt we're best most Act

153
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,470
two these particular areas I'm just

154
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,289
going to go over each section and brief

155
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,360
so if you're interested in any

156
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,789
particular section I advise you to check

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,990
out the paper and particularly the

158
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:43,210
references that go with it okay so let's

159
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,040
get started social networks I need to

160
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,200
clarify right off the bat that's not

161
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,970
social media social network analysis as

162
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,610
I just said it's a field that just

163
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,340
existed for several decades modeling and

164
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,650
understanding relationships so when we

165
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,299
want to apply this methodology to the

166
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,489
online space when you consider how the

167
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,830
platform design actually impacts the

168
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,150
construction of our networks so if we

169
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,289
want to map our campaigns to networks

170
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,359
when you consider what platform they're

171
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:15,580
on some platforms like blog linkages or

172
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,740
Twitter have asymmetric relationships

173
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,630
where you may look at or follow a

174
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,480
particular information source or

175
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,550
individual without them having the same

176
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,810
sort of information or influence from

177
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:32,260
you so the asymmetric relationships are

178
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,240
described using arrows instead of you

179
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,830
know just a straight line and that's

180
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
representative either wealth and social

181
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,210
network analysis as a directed network a

182
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,060
little bit more difficult to capture but

183
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,479
nevertheless important to mention is the

184
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,490
importance of algorithms on particularly

185
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,040
like the information we see in like a

186
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,380
newsfeed or other type of timeline

187
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,480
this is particularly present in my and

188
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,659
more mature platforms like Twitter and

189
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,730
Facebook and so I've put in just small

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,810
functions to represent the fact that

191
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,820
these algorithms are personalized in in

192
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,710
regard to each individual and the

193
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,450
relationships that they have as well as

194
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,640
other environmental factors including

195
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,930
the information they engage with so even

196
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,140
if we do not understand them we need to

197
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,940
recognize that this does impact some of

198
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,909
the information diffusion theories that

199
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,690
we might otherwise apply to this space

200
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,660
ok tell me see all right so once we have

201
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,760
mapped campaigns to networks we can

202
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,700
utilize a wide range of measures that we

203
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,860
used to describe these networks so in

204
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,160
brief like these are just some

205
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,560
high-level descriptions of measures but

206
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,600
centralization is about how much a

207
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,119
network is oriented around specific

208
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,330
actors whereas cohesion is how tightly

209
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,370
Internet a particular network is

210
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,650
modularity described is a term used to

211
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,700
describe how well that never can be

212
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,380
broken down into sub

213
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,260
groups or sub communities and an

214
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,950
assorted tivity here is degree of sorta

215
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,540
tivity or how similar in popularity or

216
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,830
number of relationships individuals have

217
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,230
they're connected to each other

218
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,750
it could also be applied to a

219
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,550
categorical variables such as gender or

220
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,190
race all right

221
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,490
so a proposal would be how could we use

222
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,250
these network measures with respect to

223
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,480
campaigns a potential approach would be

224
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,660
to use this to develop a type of

225
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,150
taxonomy basically using the fact that

226
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,730
different types of operations or

227
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,520
campaigns utilize different types of

228
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,380
social dynamics in order to be effective

229
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,020
if you want to amplify or science a

230
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,230
particular individual you may surround

231
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,290
that individual with bots or other types

232
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,780
of accounts in order to respond to them

233
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,610
or amplify their own message that would

234
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,189
result in a higher level of

235
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,630
centralization within the network on the

236
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,000
other hand astroturfing

237
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,120
which is a term used to describe the

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,520
falsification of grassroots support

239
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,980
would require developing more of like a

240
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,670
community like structure in order to

241
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,250
mimic true of pop grassroots popularity

242
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,650
and that might be representing like

243
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,630
structure a more cohesive network all

244
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:18,699
right next we're gonna move quickly to

245
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,230
identifying campaigns so what can social

246
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,570
network analysis provide here how can

247
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,810
they help us identify the covert wolves

248
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,430
among the sheep so this is actually an

249
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,109
area where I feel like there's a bit

250
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,550
more challenge associated social network

251
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,640
analysis but also where it has been

252
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,069
applied particularly in combination with

253
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,870
machine learning techniques what social

254
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,550
network analysis does is it helps us

255
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,510
look at ways to identify anomalous

256
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,150
relationships

257
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,790
so whereas machine learning may focus

258
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,030
more on independent variables associated

259
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,860
with what each account of social network

260
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,890
analysis would look more at relational

261
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,980
attributes relating to say synchronized

262
00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:00,960
activity or similar you know or other

263
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:05,860
types of maybe unusual collaboration

264
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,210
alright so and what I would say here is

265
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,590
the reason I say it's a little bit more

266
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,590
challenging is because social networking

267
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,540
alysus it usually requires a bit more

268
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,620
data because it's looking at relational

269
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,469
attributes it's a little bit more

270
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,660
computational complex so in previous

271
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,910
approaches looking at identifying

272
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,860
campaigns you know such as Cathy and

273
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,780
Carly's in all his approach to

274
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,500
identifying Isis accounts on Twitter

275
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,650
they actually used machine learning or

276
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,480
you know hand identification to find

277
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,930
Isis accounts and embrace out from those

278
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,130
accounts sampling around them to utilize

279
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,300
a mixture of independent attributes and

280
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,910
relational attributes they then

281
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,829
clustered on these accounts to identify

282
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,310
suspicions you know more and less

283
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,860
suspicious clusters with more covert

284
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,099
actors I probably should have mentioned

285
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:01,360
a state sorry but with more covert

286
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,310
actors this may take on a more like more

287
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
like a synchronization approach looking

288
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:10,569
for accounts that show up frequently on

289
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,670
the same topics or same narratives now

290
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,070
what we don't think about so much as

291
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,229
academics is necessarily the and I'll

292
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,240
say academics within like social network

293
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,980
analysis is the idea of attribution

294
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,040
nevertheless it's really important to

295
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,710
mention because of course attribution is

296
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,020
imperative for understanding what type

297
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:32,050
of action you want to take and you know

298
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,480
the the level of action that you wish to

299
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,560
respond with so it's obviously very

300
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
different if you're working with

301
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,380
teenagers versus you know nation state

302
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,930
all right so I'm just going to briefly

303
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,490
go over a couple of different clues that

304
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,650
social network analysis may provide to

305
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,900
people who are working on attribution

306
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,930
clue one would be affiliation networks

307
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,750
these are another term for this is two

308
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,260
mode network the idea is that instead of

309
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:02,170
a direct relationship you're connecting

310
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:05,080
accounts or people based on shared

311
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,110
information events or other artifacts

312
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,750
that they have in common so when you've

313
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,340
this may be useful for identifying more

314
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,650
covert relationships where you're not

315
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,840
necessarily trying to share you know

316
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,400
trying to make known your relationship

317
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,590
with another individual but you are

318
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,360
sharing the same like narrative or the

319
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,540
same like particular media are

320
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,700
fact those once you've created the

321
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,589
affiliation networks you can normalize

322
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,000
in a couple different ways to account

323
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,450
for it like particularly popular

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,810
artifacts and focus more on the stronger

325
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,490
the artifacts are stronger signals for

326
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,430
the affiliation network and then use

327
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,200
those artifacts for attribution all

328
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,449
right another approach would be

329
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,399
structural equivalent structural

330
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,399
equivalence is a general theoretical

331
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,300
idea that you know that within two

332
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,100
networks that have similar properties

333
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,920
people are nodes in somewhere role

334
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,380
because network positions represent

335
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,120
someone roles now you can take this a

336
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,910
step further and look at graph matching

337
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,350
approaches where if there are two

338
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,750
networks and you know that they have

339
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,660
overlap I mean in particular if you have

340
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,970
accounts that you have identified appear

341
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,120
in both networks you can begin to apply

342
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,279
a graph matching approach to see whether

343
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,560
or not you can identify other accounts

344
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,740
that may have you know that may exist in

345
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,979
both networks even unknowingly so I will

346
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,240
state here that the success to this

347
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,820
varies greatly depending on how many

348
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,709
known accounts you have matched already

349
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,290
and I would advise you to look at the

350
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,640
paper because there's a survey of the

351
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,880
effectiveness of these different

352
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,500
approaches all right I'm gonna go a

353
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,750
little bit faster just to make sure I've

354
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,730
covered everything in time all right

355
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,430
so I'm not gonna dwell too much on this

356
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,040
I'm hoping that the use of a globally

357
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,370
popular TV series will help make this

358
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,500
more clear but but influence is

359
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,779
something that actually social network

360
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,230
analysis is rather good at if you've

361
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:08,230
ever heard of centrality measures maybe

362
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,110
not all right and so we use centrality

363
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,899
measures to describe different types of

364
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,029
influence based on network position with

365
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,740
the idea that you know if you are for

366
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:19,510
example if you have a lot of

367
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,570
relationships in a network you're

368
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,310
probably pretty popular and so that's a

369
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,850
form of centrality captured as degree

370
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:30,510
centrality so for example Daenerys has

371
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,690
had quite a few allies

372
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:37,450
whereas betweenness centrality

373
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,370
is more of a form of brokerage so this

374
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,200
might be a point of tension where you're

375
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,780
you know subsiding you're trying to

376
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,090
maintain a balance between do two

377
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,040
different parts of the network in this

378
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,510
case maybe the north and the south it

379
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,870
can be a little awkward at times at the

380
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,460
same time that allows you to share

381
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,260
information and perhaps act in a

382
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,410
diplomatic way that would be you know

383
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,260
that your unique position affords you

384
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,750
finally close in the centrality

385
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,880
describes how many some hops or how many

386
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,070
relationships exist between you and

387
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,689
every other person in the network and

388
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,430
this can be thought of as like the

389
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,090
person who is most likely to be able to

390
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:18,130
share information easily so someone

391
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,290
who's acted as an adviser to multiple

392
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,900
other people and the network may be able

393
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,449
to share information more rapidly all

394
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,709
right so something that we're not very

395
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,020
good at yet

396
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,230
be blunt here this is a challenge it's

397
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,400
understanding how these things get

398
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,800
interacted with and interfered with in

399
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,510
the online environment because of these

400
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,140
different factors they don't really

401
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,670
exist in the natural all right let's

402
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,140
just say they're a little bit unusual in

403
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,880
the online environment I won't say the

404
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,000
economic incentives don't exist in the

405
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,230
real world but the way that but when you

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,030
talk to people you don't necessarily

407
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,280
have advertisements popping up and

408
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,990
interacting with the you know the way

409
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,140
that you interact with others so

410
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,890
understand how economic incentives

411
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:05,349
influence who is influential or how

412
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,150
algorithms mediate the the people and

413
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,409
the information you see in your newsfeed

414
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:14,140
or how moderators either in a forum

415
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,110
overtly you know banned certain accounts

416
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,670
or information or just behind the scenes

417
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,379
you know have certain roles that

418
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,079
determine what information is allowed to

419
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,689
be seen you know understanding how these

420
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,270
play into the dynamics of a network are

421
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,660
not fully understood so we've been doing

422
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,910
some the community has been doing work

423
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,800
and understanding how how the

424
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,890
environment affects relationships and

425
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,020
ultimately influence but I'd say it's

426
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,940
still in a really interesting area of

427
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,650
research and so I don't want to come in

428
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,600
here and be like hey guys we figured it

429
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,800
out but I'd say that one of the things

430
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,929
that's really interesting is there have

431
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,399
been multiple

432
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:54,040
recent efforts within the session token'

433
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,560
loss of space in order to determine best

434
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,190
models and experimental approaches for

435
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,679
trying to address these questions also

436
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,300
alright finally you want to you came in

437
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,710
here wanting to understand how you just

438
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,760
go out there and counter in that

439
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:12,970
information operation well this is the

440
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,610
you know this is kinda the last step the

441
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,960
network interventions are actually

442
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,110
developed within the public health

443
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,220
domain and so these are the ones I'm

444
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,120
going to give you're going to provide

445
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:28,620
examples from health so the idea is that

446
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,409
social influence can help can help

447
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:35,199
encourage or promotes behavior change

448
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,450
and the theory here is essentially that

449
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,050
this sort of approach works as well with

450
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,790
regards to misinformation it's important

451
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,950
to recognize that this could be you know

452
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,830
this is an ethically concerning thing to

453
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,740
go out there and to try to change hearts

454
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,600
and minds but it's important to think

455
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,280
about how would we actually do this in a

456
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,959
way that would work with people so

457
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,270
potentially as like a peaceful

458
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,860
information operation and I'm going to

459
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,900
be addressing risks and concerns with

460
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,000
each of the four main categories all

461
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,690
right so the first one that's the most

462
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,230
famous and the most most common is

463
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,050
working with famous people or main

464
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,210
influencers to share information or

465
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,730
particular message so I include Taylor

466
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,010
Swift in here because she's you know

467
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,850
she's a fairly influential online person

468
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,410
I don't know if you've heard of her but

469
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,600
she's actually this is a cropped image

470
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,870
but she's standing next to a you know go

471
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,540
vote sign and actually celebrities at

472
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,919
least in the u.s. regularly will post

473
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,450
pictures of themselves with an

474
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,970
encouragement to people to go vote and

475
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,000
this has a measurable effect on voter

476
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,670
turnout now when it comes to countering

477
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,830
an i oh the particular message one needs

478
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,360
to consider whether or not the you know

479
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,679
opinion leader actually wants to share

480
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,270
that message because it may or may not

481
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,550
be popular and it may or may not know

482
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,220
how to share it without accidentally

483
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,110
increasing more and misinformation

484
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,750
however this is one that's a relatively

485
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,120
accessible and understandable approach

486
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,660
next segmentation that's a group based

487
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,159
effort where it's more interacting with

488
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,620
people in a particular group or

489
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,860
particular or similar positions or help

490
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,479
them counter you know a misinformation

491
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,429
disinformation specific to that

492
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,980
community an example may be helping the

493
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,190
community that we're you know accounts

494
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,960
are covertly trying to come into the

495
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,670
community and influence them helping the

496
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,340
helping the members of that community

497
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,770
and signify a those accounts themselves

498
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,240
if you're going to go with a group based

499
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,500
approach I think it's important to

500
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,570
recognize that that could be perceived

501
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,020
as an attack of the community so level

502
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,360
of trust needs to be kept you know and

503
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,840
maintained all right I'm gonna go over

504
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,060
these briefly induction is you know

505
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,159
essentially promoting word-of-mouth

506
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,590
communication across existing

507
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,420
relationships so the idea being for

508
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,490
example if there's some if there's a

509
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,620
some misinformation about what has

510
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,210
happened in a particular region asking

511
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,429
the people of that region to share their

512
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,530
own stories and hopefully drown you know

513
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,840
drown out or provide a counterbalance to

514
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,000
that narrative recognizing of course

515
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,520
that could be used as a potential

516
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,150
vehicle for further misinformation

517
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,720
finally alteration changing individuals

518
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,300
or relationships within a network this

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,790
isn't necessarily as you know to make it

520
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,070
more clear think of vaccinations this is

521
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,870
actually you know education or teaching

522
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,550
people particularly those in prominent

523
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,679
areas from which they could spread

524
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:37,629
misinformation how to recognize it and

525
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:40,870
counter it themselves can help and can

526
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,400
help stop misinformation in its place an

527
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,379
example being potentially like

528
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,870
translators who are in charge of sharing

529
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,030
information with those communities

530
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:51,040
alright what have I not addressed

531
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,050
I have not addressed what content to

532
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,790
share and how to exactly involve this in

533
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,909
policy why have I done this this way

534
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:00,610
because one social network analysis does

535
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,110
not actually address content and that's

536
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,659
something I thought was a fairly strong

537
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,570
aspect of this field in application to

538
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,220
this area because a lot of times what we

539
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,350
care about is not necessarily like

540
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,000
stopping particular content but letting

541
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,280
people understand where that content is

542
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,549
coming from is the whole freedom of

543
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,789
speech

544
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:20,019
chuckle secondly I'm not a policy person

545
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,509
so I'm not going to tell you how to

546
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:24,129
strategically use these tools this is

547
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,139
where I'm a technical person coming to

548
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:28,090
you and saying hey this is what I can

549
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,699
share I'm ready to learn from you about

550
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,549
best approaches and how to work together

551
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,210
on this anyway useful references they're

552
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:44,340
way more in the paper and thank you so

553
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:47,080
[Applause]

554
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,999
thank you very much Alicia for such an

555
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,570
incredibly informative presentation I

556
00:22:48,999 --> 00:23:01,929
would now like to open up to audience

557
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:04,119
questions do we have any right now no

558
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,789
well in that case I have a question that

559
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,859
I've been meaning to ask so at the

560
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,809
moment we are very much still struggling

561
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,210
to understand the effect information

562
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,399
operations have on our society's good

563
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,529
social network analysis help us

564
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:20,018
understand the effects or maybe even the

565
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,580
impact information operations have on

566
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,950
our digital networks and digital

567
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,199
behaviors since I want to give people

568
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,749
time you know our other speakers time to

569
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,399
present I'm just going to answer to you

570
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:35,320
with multiple things so there's a couple

571
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:38,709
different approaches here so social

572
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,840
network analysis in general is you know

573
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,980
there's been a lot of research in

574
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,738
looking into how do we actually

575
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,509
understand behavior change and actually

576
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:49,659
I feel like information diffusion theory

577
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:52,149
which is related to but not necessarily

578
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:54,609
exactly social network analysis may have

579
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:57,008
some answers in this regard so

580
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:59,379
information diffusion is understanding

581
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:02,489
as the way that information is shared

582
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:05,139
and how that impacts the decisions and

583
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:08,169
behaviors that people adopt and so they

584
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:10,869
actually have a five I think I mentioned

585
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:14,080
it a five stage way to understand how

586
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:15,699
people you know have you know like hear

587
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,730
information and how that translates into

588
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,679
decision making and actually taking so

589
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,659
I'm not sure how this will relate to

590
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,100
online environment because it doesn't

591
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:27,039
necessarily you know a lot of the ways

592
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,899
that we understand this you know theory

593
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,470
and the way that we study it is actually

594
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,879
working with

595
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,159
in the real world I think that the

596
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:35,709
hardest thing here is understanding how

597
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,340
to kind of see behind the curtain of

598
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,559
social media and social and and you know

599
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,908
accounts to the actual people and so I

600
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:47,139
think that you know as people develop

601
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,879
more research and computational social

602
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:51,879
science but I also like go out and

603
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:54,428
actually talk to people that hopefully

604
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:56,199
will develop things you know further in

605
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,970
that way I'll mention briefly there's

606
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,649
also some work being done and causal

607
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,740
inference and social network analysis

608
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:05,500
looking at what try and get beyond

609
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,740
correlation between you know behaviors

610
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,909
and relationships to actually looking at

611
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:14,679
they're trying to understand what are

612
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:17,259
what causes changes in relationships

613
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:22,029
but I'm probably not qualified to speak

614
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:25,990
about that but anyway point is we're all

615
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:27,879
working on it together so not yet but a

616
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,460
lot of people are from that field are

617
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:32,230
very interested in this problem as well

618
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,529
wonderful thank you very much any other

619
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:38,230
questions

620
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:41,919
right well in that case we can now move

621
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:45,070
on to the second panelist of the day who

622
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,769
is Renee the Resta Renee is a Mozilla

623
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,720
Fellow in media misinformation and Trust

624
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:52,899
she investigates the spread of

625
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,539
disinformation and malign narratives in

626
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:57,789
the digital domain and has advised the

627
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:00,580
Congress State Department and senior

628
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,529
executives on the topic she recently led

629
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,870
one of the two teams that conducted

630
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:08,440
research into Russian interference on

631
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:11,439
behalf of the Senate Select Committee on

632
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,629
Intelligence and today she will tell us

633
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,059
about how her team conducted this

634
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:18,250
research using social network analysis

635
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,139
and what it is that they found Renee the

636
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:25,570
floor is yours thank you

637
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:29,110
hi everybody hey um so click right in so

638
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,370
my name is Renee de Oeste and I I got my

639
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,439
start in social network analysis

640
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,620
actually as a I guess you could call it

641
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,509
an activist in 2015 looking at how

642
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,039
anti-vaxxers in California were

643
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:42,230
networking online to influence

644
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,850
legislation and I was interested less in

645
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,280
and academic understanding of the

646
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,629
problem than in an understanding of how

647
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,490
they were coordinating who they were

648
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,250
communicating with where their high

649
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,720
centrality nodes were and why that

650
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,880
little purple section out there which is

651
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,280
not very interconnected nor very

652
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,720
influential that is the public health

653
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,850
community so trying to get a better

654
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,190
understanding of where we were falling

655
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,949
down how this infrastructure had put

656
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,620
itself together green or anti-vaxxers

657
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,330
blue is the autism community red is at

658
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,429
the time the American Tea Party and the

659
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,620
emergent yellow cluster was we're

660
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,680
watching their messages evolved in real

661
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,120
time as they were losing votes in the

662
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,960
California Senate so we were really

663
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:28,340
interested in very specifically how this

664
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,230
was happening so I wound up in early

665
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,780
2016 this is not work that I did but

666
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,250
this is the ISIS Twitter census I wound

667
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,990
up getting asked by the Obama

668
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,700
administration to talk about social

669
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,700
network analysis and how again we could

670
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,560
understand who was doing what and how

671
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,310
because what we were finding was that

672
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,950
Isis's methodology for creating high

673
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,629
centrality influencers recruiters

674
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,550
spreading their message building the

675
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,440
digital Caliphate was very similar to

676
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:57,530
what we were seeing being done by other

677
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,390
entities and so I met these researchers

678
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,250
we kind of compared our findings and we

679
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,210
saw this remarkable similarity and

680
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,230
tactics which leads to the kind of first

681
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,030
premise that I'm going to stay here

682
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,920
which is disinformation is not a truth

683
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,870
and narrative problem it's an

684
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,870
information ecosystem manipulation

685
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,790
problem the narrative is a you know of

686
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,260
course related to the particular actor

687
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,600
the particular thing that's happening

688
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:24,350
but when we look at this as a conceptual

689
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,540
problem the issue is that this is a

690
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,060
function of the information ecosystem

691
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,740
that we have so this is a technique that

692
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,800
can be used by anybody who wants to

693
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,960
disseminate a message and the reason for

694
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,730
that briefly is that the social

695
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,740
platforms you know they kind of evolved

696
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,930
over time but over the last 10 or so

697
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,930
years to have mass consolidation of

698
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,420
audiences GameA bilal girth and highly

699
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,400
sophisticated targeting systems and what

700
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,990
happened is the platforms kind of

701
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,720
inadvertently set the rules of the game

702
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,260
by building technology to connect people

703
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,150
to one another they also

704
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,250
made it possible for anyone to connect

705
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,580
to you as well which effectively

706
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,230
translate the you know translates the

707
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,030
social ecosystem into a dual use

708
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:10,170
technology so anybody who wants to reach

709
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:12,240
you can reach you now so I was one of

710
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,650
the researchers who I led a team of

711
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,240
researchers for the Senate Select

712
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,980
Committee on Intelligence looking at

713
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,060
Russian influence operations in the u.s.

714
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,950
from 2014 to 2017 and I want to start by

715
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,200
saying that one of the significant gaps

716
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,080
in in social network analysis with

717
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,690
Russia was that the anti-vaxxers were

718
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,550
very overt Isis was extremely over it

719
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,580
the iconography was out there they made

720
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:37,680
no secret of who they were so looking at

721
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,990
network analysis with a clearly

722
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,350
detectable adversary that wants to be

723
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,760
found is fundamentally different than

724
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,219
than looking at an adversary that is

725
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,140
doing it extremely subversively and does

726
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:54,240
not want to be found

727
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,650
so b/c that's the best way to the

728
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,600
similarity there though is that

729
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,820
ultimately any propagandist needs an

730
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,510
audience so regardless of whether you

731
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,070
are over to begin with or doing

732
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,620
something covertly and amassing an

733
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,139
audience over time you still ultimately

734
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,500
have to go out and amass an audience and

735
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,210
reach them and so that kind of

736
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,370
vulnerability that need to push

737
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,350
information out to mass quantities of

738
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,830
people means that we can think of

739
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,500
disinformation as a set of stages kind

740
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,980
of independent of who the actor is

741
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,810
recognizing that there are certain

742
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,770
things that they're all going to need to

743
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:33,840
do and so this is how recently we've

744
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,790
come to to be to think about

745
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,340
disinformation campaigns specifically in

746
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,530
the context of staged operations and

747
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,389
then we within the series of stages we

748
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,139
think about what are the interventions

749
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,610
at each moment at each of those stages

750
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,080
so somewhat similarly to what's called

751
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,850
the kill chain methodology and cyber

752
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,620
security where there's sort of a set

753
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,570
series of phases that an attacker goes

754
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,100
through to get to command and control we

755
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,629
think about when you're building and

756
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,730
amassing an audience that you are going

757
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,830
to then propagandize to what are the

758
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,630
steps that you take recognizing that the

759
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:07,320
rules are ultimately set by the feature

760
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:09,210
set of the social platforms so positing

761
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,408
this one right here for right now

762
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,080
relative to what I'm going to talk about

763
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:14,580
with Russia this is kind of an ongoing

764
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,649
ongoing series of conversations with a

765
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,928
number of researchers extremely

766
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:20,370
interdisciplinary around how we look at

767
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,409
information operations that we've

768
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,600
observed now over the last five years to

769
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:27,029
try to build a more robust set of stages

770
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,428
but for right now let's look at how the

771
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:33,720
internet research agency executed on

772
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:35,429
these stages so in the case of the

773
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,770
internet research agency data set

774
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:41,029
the attribution was done by the

775
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:44,279
platforms so it was alphabet Twitter and

776
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:46,529
Facebook alphabet included YouTube and

777
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,490
it also included Google search so at

778
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,309
sorry Nelson Google search Google

779
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,750
Adwords and then with Facebook and it

780
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,879
included both Facebook and Instagram

781
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,220
data so it's interesting to stand up

782
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,659
here you know I think I can't really I

783
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,830
can't claim credit for the attribution

784
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:04,529
at the original data set but one what

785
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,110
they identified were the assets so the

786
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:09,840
entities that the that the internet

787
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,178
research agency used to disseminate the

788
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,860
propaganda and then the collateral which

789
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,960
is the content that they put out and I

790
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,610
want to keep those things separate and

791
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,440
distinct for reasons that will I think

792
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:24,389
become a little bit clearer as we go so

793
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,100
the way that the attribution was done

794
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,450
was not actually communicated to the

795
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,158
researchers who looked at the set and

796
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,210
that's because Facebook and Twitter and

797
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,250
the others don't want to put out there

798
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,730
attribution methodologies because they

799
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:38,039
don't want the adversary to then evade

800
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,299
but we're extrapolating that the first

801
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,450
thing that they looked at was metadata

802
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:44,309
so that's email addresses phone numbers

803
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,860
geo data device signatures accounts

804
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:49,230
domain registration data IP addresses

805
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,969
tracking pixels so they had this

806
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,799
collection of metadata this is from

807
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:57,210
Twitter one thing that you'll see here

808
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,559
that's interesting the accounts are

809
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,390
pretending to be us

810
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,330
news organizations so Baltimore Atlanta

811
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:05,640
Oakland the geolocation is like

812
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,889
Kazakhstan and they're registered on B

813
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,860
Lyon Russia phones so this is extremely

814
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,440
sloppy and we don't expect to have

815
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,799
anything this easy in the future but

816
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,260
that's how the last operation was done

817
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:21,510
so the second technique that they used

818
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,129
beyond metadata was network connections

819
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,480
and interactions between accounts

820
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,679
so that's accounts who communicated with

821
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,900
each other that were friends with each

822
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:35,130
other that were Co admins of the same

823
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:37,289
page sorry I got a cold on the plane so

824
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,270
social platforms have visibility into

825
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:42,539
different networks than we have from the

826
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:45,389
outside as outside researchers we can't

827
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:48,360
see any of this so we are at the mercy

828
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,740
of looking at the collateral so this is

829
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,860
the assets and then we have the

830
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,780
collateral and so as we are as outside

831
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,240
researchers are working with platforms

832
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,129
to improve detection methodology as we

833
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,530
go through this just think about what

834
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:05,669
the platforms can see versus what the

835
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:07,350
researchers can see so one of the things

836
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,240
that you know just looking at some of

837
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,679
the tactics that they did to amass that

838
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,839
audience that they were propagandizing

839
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,740
to is they built these long-standing

840
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,139
relationships with communities they

841
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,638
built tribes so this is some of their

842
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,669
Instagram this is their Instagram

843
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,060
accounts that about 133 of them you can

844
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:28,649
see some were extremely successful had

845
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,710
300,000 followers others were extremely

846
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:33,750
small 3,000 followers they didn't build

847
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,210
them all up at the same time they turned

848
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,100
them on and off they laid the groundwork

849
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,990
where they registered the account and

850
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,790
then didn't use the account until months

851
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:44,009
to potentially years later they

852
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:47,159
repurposed these accounts so there's one

853
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:49,139
of them army of Jesus which was a

854
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,149
Christian page a fake Christian page

855
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,520
started out as a Kermit the Frog meme

856
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:55,500
page then it became a Simpsons meme page

857
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,140
and then it last wound up being a

858
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,210
Christian page so you see this sort of

859
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,250
digital marketer techniques of trying

860
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,619
these personas out seeing what works

861
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,840
over time developing an understanding

862
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,980
amassing that audience and then after

863
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,410
they have that relationship with that

864
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,160
audience they continue to grow their

865
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,049
audience over time so they blanketed the

866
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,020
Internet this is black matters this is

867
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:21,030
again one page black matters had a

868
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,750
website it had a SoundCloud a tumblr a

869
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:28,290
Twitter of Facebook and Instagram it had

870
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:30,270
a gosh what else that it interfaced was

871
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,460
like a Tumblr account pushing a Pokemon

872
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,570
go operation I mean the thing was

873
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,250
everywhere these are oh those are

874
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,150
Facebook stickers little Black Panther

875
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,619
Facebook stickers

876
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,690
they communicated with people on

877
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:42,820
messenger they put up things saying join

878
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,160
our team so this was not just a social

879
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,500
media operation this isn't a community

880
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,270
infiltration operation and again once

881
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,310
you have that infiltration that takes on

882
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,410
a whole other level because that kind of

883
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,150
communication is happening one on one if

884
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,520
you're in this case via Facebook

885
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,109
messenger but via messaging apps we

886
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,869
actually saw Isis do quite a bit of that

887
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:04,480
to reach people in the overt space put

888
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:06,880
them into a one on one channel and then

889
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,470
activate them to do something in the

890
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,839
case of the Internet research agency

891
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:13,060
activate to do something was literally

892
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,250
go out into the streets and protest go

893
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,960
document protests just the creation of

894
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,240
pseudo events in the real world that

895
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,210
they would then use collateralize push

896
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,899
out on their sites as as video and other

897
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:30,010
content later on down the operation so

898
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:32,290
this kind of thing you can see the brand

899
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,810
as it appears across the internet so

900
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,970
again if you have some indication that

901
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,099
one piece of this operation is

902
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,839
potentially malign then you can track it

903
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,079
around the internet and kind of round up

904
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:45,099
the collateral and build out an

905
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,690
assessment of what the network looks

906
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,660
like based on that but until you have

907
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,369
that first clue this just kind of flew

908
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,509
under the radar for about two and a half

909
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:57,280
years so they repurpose their content

910
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,859
across pages this was something that we

911
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,720
saw you'll see the same memes branded

912
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:04,270
for the different pages so on the bottom

913
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,669
you've got a account called pan-african

914
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,810
routes move on the top the little BM

915
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,740
there again I showed you the black

916
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,328
matters logo before that kind of pant

917
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:16,509
internet blanketing meant that they did

918
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:18,369
with that brand these were also to the

919
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,380
best of my knowledge this content was

920
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,599
cribbed from other people's tumblr

921
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,130
accounts so the other thing that they do

922
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,010
is sometimes they're creating their own

923
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,829
content when you have a distinct kernel

924
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,109
of content that an adversary has created

925
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:34,660
you can use things like image clustering

926
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:36,700
and other methodologies reverse image

927
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,720
search certain types of lookups to try

928
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:42,609
to track that that track that content

929
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,899
across pages across the internet but

930
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,089
ultimately the challenge is that

931
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,819
propaganda is designed to be shared and

932
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:49,430
so they're not always creating their own

933
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:51,980
often

934
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,180
time's their repurposing so a lot of the

935
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,680
stuff that was targeting the right

936
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,450
leaning communities was pulling from

937
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,980
sites like Breitbart from sites like

938
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:03,169
Turning Point USA so real American hyper

939
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,970
partisan media and what we later saw

940
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,099
with the Iranian operation which was

941
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,689
executed in much the same way is that

942
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:10,040
they didn't even bother trying to create

943
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,990
their own content they really just

944
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,420
leaned into taking hyper-partisan media

945
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,220
so image clustering does it no it has

946
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,170
some value in helping us find this stuff

947
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,828
but again there there are serious

948
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:24,290
limitations so if we go back to thinking

949
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,609
about stages the kind of creation of

950
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,759
operational resources

951
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:30,619
that's the amassing of the assets

952
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,630
community infiltration that's done both

953
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:34,400
of the at the social level but also

954
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,950
again very much in messenger and

955
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,030
one-on-one identification of opportunity

956
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:43,848
what I mean by that is there are highly

957
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:46,220
discrete operations that exist because

958
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:47,660
of a moment in time something happens in

959
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,790
the real world that provides an

960
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,710
opportunity to activate a network to

961
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,230
push out a disinformation campaign a

962
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,299
hashtag comes up Covington Catholic was

963
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,040
an example in the u.s. a thing that was

964
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:59,869
an extremely real event that happened

965
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,140
but it became a cultural moment in the

966
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:04,460
US and that allowed for four accounts to

967
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,500
come in and amplify the most

968
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,480
controversial stuff but the other thing

969
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,809
that they do is with with the the long

970
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,299
term state actors you see laying of the

971
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:16,760
groundwork several years before I need

972
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:18,950
to operationalize the account so it's

973
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,750
kind of a low-grade propagandist

974
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,970
dissemination and then they will

975
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,099
identify opportunities to turn on the

976
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,299
accounts to really lean into a moment of

977
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,460
tension in society

978
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:30,380
collateral production or appropriation

979
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,890
again sometimes they make it other times

980
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,809
they crib it from hyper partisan media

981
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,700
targeted dissemination pushing it out in

982
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:40,069
small groups and then computational

983
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,919
amplification this is where you see

984
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:45,609
stuff like the next few slides I'll show

985
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:50,809
you which is using network analysis to

986
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:53,180
to do kind of assessments of reach so

987
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:54,950
this is looking at Twitter accounts and

988
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,500
when they were tweeting you'll notice

989
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,390
those blocks those blocks are accounts

990
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,190
that are tweeting in unison so that's an

991
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,240
indication that there is something

992
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:06,440
highly chord

993
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,600
that's happening here this is an eye

994
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,410
chart I apologize it's so ugly I made it

995
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,400
myself it's a well I did it because I

996
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,140
was you know I was going through like

997
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,760
two hundred thousand memes and one of

998
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,279
the things I was trying to look at we

999
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,420
had you know you have to just to talk

1000
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,020
about the methodology here for a little

1001
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,250
bit so there were 400 gigs worth of

1002
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,509
content provided to us the platforms

1003
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,030
didn't communicate with each other so

1004
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,040
this is a forensic operation not a

1005
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,440
detection operation but what we were

1006
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,930
trying to get at was after you know you

1007
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,510
have the clustering algorithms the OCR

1008
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,399
the anomaly detection for language

1009
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,200
looking at hashtags all the ways that

1010
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,180
you can do it the next thing that we

1011
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,919
were trying to do trying to understand

1012
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,990
was how these accounts pointed to each

1013
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,510
other and sometimes you can assess that

1014
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,799
through text but other times in this

1015
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,280
case it was actually looking at the

1016
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,980
brand marks so the BM versus the

1017
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,890
pan-african routes move if you saw what

1018
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:04,369
I meant there that's really it's a much

1019
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,660
more sophisticated computer vision to do

1020
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,580
that easily than than we had time for

1021
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,700
but so what what you're seeing here is

1022
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,230
the squares are Facebook pages that are

1023
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,410
owned by the internet research agency

1024
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,880
the in the parallelograms or Instagram

1025
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,609
accounts owned by the internet research

1026
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,530
agency and the clouds are things that

1027
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,330
were not in the data set which means the

1028
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,280
platforms had not attributed them to the

1029
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,960
internet research agency but if they

1030
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,660
appear in this chart it's because they

1031
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,070
appeared more than 10 times in terms of

1032
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:35,629
either visually or aniseh or a link or a

1033
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:38,270
mention by name and so we were trying to

1034
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:40,460
put together how they interlink their

1035
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,680
pages and the reason for this is you can

1036
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,900
either amass your audience by buying it

1037
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,960
meaning by running an ad driving someone

1038
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,850
to a Facebook page or group or you

1039
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,700
piggyback on the audience that you have

1040
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:54,529
and using organic posts you cross

1041
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,930
promote your other pages and your other

1042
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,550
content so once someone follows one of

1043
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,950
your pages they're seeing the rest of

1044
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:03,050
your content and so that's how you use

1045
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,750
the collateral to grow your audience

1046
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:08,359
both for free and also under the radar

1047
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:11,510
of any kind of AD you know the

1048
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,400
Facebook's latest in an ad detection and

1049
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,440
add transparency is to try to make it

1050
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,610
easier for people to look at ads so if

1051
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,400
you're a sophisticated

1052
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:21,410
sophisticated adversary you just evolved

1053
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,720
away from ads you skip that part and you

1054
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:27,230
lean into leveraging what you have built

1055
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,939
that groundwork to network out so this

1056
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,190
was just the black community pages on

1057
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,260
Facebook if you followed one you saw

1058
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,870
tons of the rest of it and they

1059
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,540
integrated with real black community

1060
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:41,900
media which made themselves at Vevey

1061
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,250
we're doing cross post promotions so

1062
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,910
real black community media was

1063
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:49,880
amplifying fake Russian malign black

1064
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,660
community media this is a network

1065
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,730
analysis looking at the Instagram

1066
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:59,930
mentions so this was just based on text

1067
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:01,580
so you could see the red dots are

1068
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,220
accounts owned by the internet research

1069
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,509
agency the blue dots are again accounts

1070
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,799
that we do not believe are in any way

1071
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,730
attributable but they mentioned them

1072
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,280
over ten times so this is infiltrating a

1073
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:16,160
community and becoming part of a media

1074
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,660
ecosystem same analysis done with

1075
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,799
hashtags so we also looked at

1076
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,259
conversationally so you can look by

1077
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,780
account or you can look by conversations

1078
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,910
on Instagram hashtags are a big part of

1079
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,030
the discovery process so what you see

1080
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:37,069
here is areas in which certain keywords

1081
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:39,230
like Jesus or police become areas where

1082
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,990
they can push two sides of an issue and

1083
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,240
create tension so police is probably the

1084
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,709
best example of this the black community

1085
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,390
pages focused very heavily on

1086
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,730
officer-involved violence and racism

1087
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,620
they also had a collection of accounts

1088
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,650
that were blue lives matter prolong

1089
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:57,080
enforcement using identical hash tags to

1090
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,030
push opposite sides both in terms of

1091
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,310
memes and content so that's when we talk

1092
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,200
about sowing division exacerbating

1093
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,090
tension this is one of the ways that you

1094
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:10,339
can do that and so again as we try to

1095
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:13,370
look for how do we use forensic ly what

1096
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,660
we learn from here to look outwards this

1097
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,920
is where we start to get at ways in

1098
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:21,560
which we found active accounts so again

1099
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,260
there was this is as dick Garcia friends

1100
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,090
of Russia as Nicosia had a Twitter

1101
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:29,060
account

1102
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,470
this was great Sputnik embedded the

1103
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,650
internet research agencies

1104
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:37,009
fake account and one of their articles

1105
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:38,690
just doing really basic googling did you

1106
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,310
know it you know hey where where else

1107
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:44,030
does this stuff live just and just

1108
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:46,190
running through it led us to a video

1109
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,140
that Sputnik embedded from a different

1110
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,510
Russian troll that led to a different

1111
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,160
Facebook page we started basically going

1112
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,780
through and looking all the hashtags for

1113
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,160
anomalous language there were certain

1114
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,730
things that they did that no American

1115
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,009
would have done just like weird

1116
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:03,710
nicknames for Hillary Clinton things

1117
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,970
that were overly formal that just you

1118
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,640
know kind of hit that uncanny valley

1119
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:09,529
where you you know this is this is where

1120
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,279
the the human kind of component comes in

1121
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:14,359
in a way that you possibly could you

1122
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,640
know we're trying to think about as we

1123
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:18,109
do these analyses what what can we take

1124
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,490
away from what the human analysts pick

1125
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:24,290
up to help machines do a better job but

1126
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,770
really looking at things like how can we

1127
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:29,779
find more operational assets by looking

1128
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:33,890
at the breadcrumbs from the things that

1129
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,690
that we've that we found in the past but

1130
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,930
here's the next problem attribution is a

1131
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:41,750
significant challenge so this page here

1132
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,460
black elevation they had a twitter

1133
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,290
account called black elevations so when

1134
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,599
a facebook page named black elevation

1135
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:49,369
flag there were two of them one belonged

1136
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,859
to the internet research agency but the

1137
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:53,990
second did not so they did a lot of

1138
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:56,270
namespace overloads where there would be

1139
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,578
a real page with a real name and they

1140
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:00,530
would twist it just ever so slightly so

1141
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:01,880
kind of flying under the radar so that

1142
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,829
you didn't know if you were looking at

1143
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,780
the real page or not there's a u.s.

1144
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:07,130
organization called cop block it's an

1145
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,560
activist organization that monitors

1146
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,450
officer-involved violence and it has

1147
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,310
chapters all over the US so they set up

1148
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,598
a fake cop block site because that's the

1149
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,920
kind of thing that you know everybody

1150
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,810
would just write off as like oh that's

1151
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,359
their you know that's their small

1152
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,980
community version of cop block this this

1153
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:23,450
thing though black elevation this I

1154
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,750
believe to the best of my knowledge this

1155
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,669
is in fact a real authentic American but

1156
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,980
it shared a ton of internet research

1157
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,450
agency memes during that relevant period

1158
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,770
and this is where we get at the

1159
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,020
distinction between assets and

1160
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:39,380
collateral again and that the collateral

1161
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:41,599
persists and so there are still accounts

1162
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,349
all over American media that still share

1163
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,180
IRA collateral because it resin

1164
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:48,580
so when we talk about impact with this

1165
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,839
stuff it's not just did it swing the

1166
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:54,040
election which is the only thing I ever

1167
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:55,660
get asked it's actually the what to what

1168
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,609
extent do the communities they target

1169
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,589
incorporate the message and go on and

1170
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:01,540
spread it and that is what we look at

1171
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:03,880
when we understand you know the impact

1172
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:07,990
of propaganda we have always believed

1173
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,240
since the 1920s that propaganda works in

1174
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:13,359
some capacity is why it was a huge body

1175
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,890
of literature the target is the same

1176
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,619
right people haven't changed the

1177
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,180
dissemination has changed and so we can

1178
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:20,859
look at that and we can use social

1179
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,859
network analysis to try to understand

1180
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:24,970
what that looks like and how it's done

1181
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:27,400
computationally but ultimately when we

1182
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:33,279
talk about impact it's it's really hard

1183
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,869
to to try to limit you know to limit

1184
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,910
ourselves to like what was the discrete

1185
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:41,650
moment in time versus what does it do to

1186
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:43,330
a society on a more long-term level so

1187
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,099
again as we talk about proactive

1188
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,720
detection going forward

1189
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:48,580
tech companies they've got great

1190
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,669
visibility into their silo they are

1191
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:54,190
excellent an intra platform analysis

1192
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,830
outside researchers do not have access

1193
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:59,920
to that sort of metadata or any of the

1194
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,509
interesting account pieces there but

1195
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,580
what we can see is how information hops

1196
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,530
from platform to platform we can see

1197
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,779
something on Sputnik that has a twitter

1198
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,580
account and that is on Facebook that

1199
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,950
kind of analysis isn't being done by the

1200
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,869
individual companies so this is where as

1201
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,759
we talk about solutions it's really that

1202
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:18,070
collaboration and the ability to create

1203
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,280
those channels of communication that is

1204
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:23,619
so key for for making this work going

1205
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,500
forward network analysis you know we

1206
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,700
know it works we it has limitations

1207
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,609
depending on what stage in a campaign

1208
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,259
you're in it's more or less useful but

1209
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:35,348
ultimately we need to be talking about

1210
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,849
information sharing so this is only

1211
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:39,400
getting harder what we're seeing what we

1212
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:42,070
saw in 2018 and 2020 those sloppy

1213
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,410
mistakes with Kazakhstan IP addresses

1214
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,869
for US News Twitter accounts that's

1215
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:50,589
never going to happen again or it

1216
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:53,080
shouldn't so this is only getting harder

1217
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:54,790
and we have to get better at thinking

1218
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,160
about collaborative ways to work

1219
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,880
together social network analysis is

1220
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,339
useful as a

1221
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,050
cool but ultimately we are not its most

1222
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,060
useful to at this point trigger human

1223
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:07,030
review so it's still ultimately the

1224
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,860
machines will surface flags and things

1225
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,750
to look at which are then given to human

1226
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,760
analysts who have to do the the hard

1227
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:16,780
work of trying to run down things like

1228
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,970
attribution right now it's a you know OS

1229
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,550
nth problem it's a human problem it's a

1230
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,020
SIGINT problem it's sort of all of the

1231
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,610
things that that we would have to look

1232
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,380
at to understand influence campaigns in

1233
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,050
the past we have to do on on social

1234
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,640
media as well and then addressing the

1235
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,520
problem requires interdisciplinary

1236
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,470
research and multi-stakeholder

1237
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,509
cooperation so happy to talk about this

1238
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:45,970
and I think I should stop Natalie some

1239
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:48,070
time for questions thank you thank you

1240
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:50,560
very much Renee for such a wonderful

1241
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:52,750
presentation I see we have some hands up

1242
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,790
already so let's hear some questions

1243
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:59,950
from the audience we can take the first

1244
00:49:54,790 --> 00:50:02,830
one here hello you you described a

1245
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,689
networked ecosystem that the IRA used to

1246
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,009
kind of promote an amplify content and I

1247
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:09,360
believe Alicia has done some work on

1248
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:12,460
that too on how that elevates your

1249
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,040
visibility on Twitter feeds yeah if you

1250
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:17,140
have that ecosystem by contrast I think

1251
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,170
in NATO we have presentations that

1252
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:23,290
individually send out messages probably

1253
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:26,260
with a very strict approval process and

1254
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:28,810
so could you comment on how I mean it

1255
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,220
almost seems like IRA has much greater

1256
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:32,200
amplification in the information

1257
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,250
environment because they're able to

1258
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,560
create that ecosystem

1259
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,080
how might NATO talk about changing their

1260
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,090
policies and strategies to learn from

1261
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,560
IRA to be more effective at

1262
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:43,510
communicating NATO message

1263
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,100
yeah and that was that's what we thought

1264
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,170
the anti-vaxxers to actually it was just

1265
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,660
the the channels of communication the

1266
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:51,190
influencer is staying on message they I

1267
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,740
mean the they were sitting there in

1268
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:56,170
facebook groups that were named things

1269
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,430
like tweet for vaccine freedom pushing

1270
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,560
the messages that everybody was supposed

1271
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,089
to say at the time you know and it's

1272
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,920
it's not even learning from the IRA the

1273
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,720
IRA learned from marketers is a

1274
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,830
marketing problem right and so what

1275
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,620
they're doing is they're just running a

1276
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:10,000
very sophisticated set aside from the

1277
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,279
infiltration and

1278
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,190
you know the stuff that was much more

1279
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,079
like traditional asset development that

1280
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:19,839
you would see from spying the social

1281
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:23,280
media operation was digital marketing

1282
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:25,839
best practices I refine your message

1283
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:30,339
coordinate with your with your

1284
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:31,690
amplifying partners a B test all the

1285
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:33,460
content that you're putting out they

1286
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,800
were reusing their best content they'd a

1287
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,940
that a meme called like like I was a

1288
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:43,030
picture of Jesus excuse me and it said

1289
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,490
like for like a few loved Jesus ignore

1290
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,980
if you don't and so this is like you

1291
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,759
know so everybody hits the heart button

1292
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,410
where they hit the like button on

1293
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,490
Facebook and this pushes the content out

1294
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,109
to all of their friends if they're on

1295
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,069
Facebook and if they're on Instagram

1296
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,420
when they hit the like button it

1297
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,369
reinforces to the algorithm that they

1298
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,230
want to see more of the content so all

1299
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:00,579
these are just digital marketing like

1300
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,109
digital marketing and influencer

1301
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:07,569
marketing best practices and that's

1302
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:09,819
where I think that governments and the

1303
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:11,740
US CDC and other agencies that have to

1304
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:21,420
try to counter this stuff are just not

1305
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:21,419
there thank you any other questions yes

1306
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:29,829
thank you very much for this extremely

1307
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,500
interesting presentation my name is Tim

1308
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:34,930
on wooden hawser from the Red Cross my

1309
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,839
question is rather basic what does it

1310
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:40,149
what does it take to to do such an

1311
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,430
operation you know what kind of do you

1312
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:45,460
need to be sophisticated acting like the

1313
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:48,669
IRA or can you gain much smaller actors

1314
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,540
have comparable impacts yeah so that was

1315
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:54,339
um I tried to cram so much in 20 minutes

1316
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,529
the what I meant when I was alluding to

1317
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:59,770
the discrete moment versus the long-term

1318
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:01,869
multi-year operation the IRA budget as

1319
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,280
we found through the the Muller report

1320
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:06,339
in the sorry it was it was the Eastern

1321
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,619
District of Virginia indictments they

1322
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:10,540
indicted the accountant the the internet

1323
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,280
research agencies bookkeeper and what

1324
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,470
they had found was that it was about a

1325
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,270
twenty five million dollar budget for

1326
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:19,810
what they accomplished in the US over

1327
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:21,579
about two years so to run long-term

1328
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,350
sustained operations like that it's very

1329
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:26,260
expensive but then you

1330
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:28,420
see things like usually the same tactics

1331
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,220
are being used by domestic ideologues in

1332
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,080
the US we have you know 4chan and some

1333
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,640
of the trolling campaigns where it's

1334
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,590
just people who decide that they're

1335
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,900
gonna connect with each other and go out

1336
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:39,940
and get a hashtag trending make

1337
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,950
something a story and if you if you get

1338
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,390
something trending mainstream media will

1339
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,919
often pick it up and write about it and

1340
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,350
then this is where I didn't even get

1341
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,090
into the degree to which the media

1342
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:53,920
inadvertently amplified their content

1343
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:56,590
also but the you can run an influence

1344
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,720
operation with very minimal resources

1345
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:01,000
just you know a handful of friends by a

1346
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,390
couple you can buy some BOTS you can buy

1347
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,620
them on the black market you can buy

1348
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,480
Instagram engagement and other things to

1349
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,670
try to game your way up the algorithm

1350
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,990
used to be a little bit easier this is

1351
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:13,240
where the conversations that we have

1352
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:15,310
with platforms I take this stuff and

1353
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,080
then you know we try to communicate with

1354
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,700
platforms as well as communicating with

1355
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,830
regulators because platforms are like

1356
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,480
that first line of defense so if you go

1357
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:24,100
to Twitter and you say like you guys are

1358
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,630
consistently getting gamed in the

1359
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,670
following ways people are constantly

1360
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:30,640
making things trend on your platform

1361
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:34,960
just through basic botnets just you know

1362
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,290
the amplification automation they have

1363
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,150
the capability to to say that certain

1364
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:42,580
accounts are going to be down weighted

1365
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:45,490
as they calculate what should be a trend

1366
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:48,160
so accounts that are largely automated

1367
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,629
can be removed from the waiting to

1368
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,850
determine if something as a trend as a

1369
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,520
way of more accurately surfacing real

1370
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:56,410
organic trends versus ways in which

1371
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:02,920
malign actors were just gaming things so

1372
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:13,359
that make sense right we can take one

1373
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:15,550
more question yes please hi barry Sanda

1374
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,340
fgv Brazil thank you for an amazing

1375
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,930
presentation I have a broad question so

1376
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,640
you can narrow it as much but I just

1377
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:23,830
want wanted your professional opinion on

1378
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,750
what what would you like to see from the

1379
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:29,560
platforms doing more of

1380
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:35,170
ideally in this space you know on the

1381
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:38,500
state-sponsored stuff we have channels

1382
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:40,940
of communication now we have

1383
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,069
we have a lot of that you know in the

1384
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,480
u.s. midterms the FBI provided Facebook

1385
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:45,650
with some tips that led to a network

1386
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,710
coming down right so the things that we

1387
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:51,319
did not have in 2016 we do have now it's

1388
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:54,170
actually more the how do we think about

1389
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:57,230
just the dissemination of algorithmic

1390
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:58,609
propaganda this is a big problem in the

1391
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:02,119
US you might have followed our Nancy

1392
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:05,089
Pelosi saga yeah so for those who don't

1393
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,010
know there was a doctored video of Nancy

1394
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:08,690
Pelosi that went viral on Facebook it

1395
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:12,920
was not spread by a foreign intelligence

1396
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:14,900
service it it is unclear if there was

1397
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,230
malign distribution involved one of the

1398
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:20,329
problems is we're still very much like

1399
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:22,760
looking back on things as opposed to

1400
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:25,190
being good at developing a detection

1401
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,660
earlier and so one of the reasons we're

1402
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,220
talking about things like staging

1403
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,960
methodologies is how can we help them

1404
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,990
understand what should trigger an

1405
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,990
immediate review so if a video appears

1406
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:38,209
to be going viral is there a moment at

1407
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:40,959
which the platform does kind of put a

1408
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:43,579
human reviewer on it are there are there

1409
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,220
moments where they're more willing to

1410
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:50,930
turn off the virality engine to try to

1411
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:52,700
avoid the spread of you know and just

1412
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,319
propaganda we've seen that sometimes

1413
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,149
people don't even read the stuff so do

1414
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,440
we change the sharing button so that you

1415
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,180
have to have actually clicked through

1416
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,150
and read the article as opposed to just

1417
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:04,940
than sensational headline triggering a

1418
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:09,790
virality event these are the sorts of

1419
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:13,730
things where we can make an impact on

1420
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:16,670
ways that any type of actor state or

1421
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:18,260
otherwise tries to game the algorithms

1422
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,550
to achieve mass reach and I think that's

1423
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:23,569
the conversation that we need to be

1424
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:26,119
having now great please save all the

1425
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:29,450
other questions for the general Q&A

1426
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:31,910
after the final speaker who I would like

1427
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:34,040
to introduce now it's Major Jeff Nichols

1428
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:36,950
who is the head of digital operations

1429
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,410
for the 77th Brigade he has spent the

1430
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:41,689
last two years supporting NATO and the

1431
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:44,240
enhanced former presence in Estonia and

1432
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:46,760
understanding how the online information

1433
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,589
environment is being manipulated major

1434
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,600
Nichols continues to support Nero's

1435
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:52,700
development and understanding

1436
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,549
information environment assessment and

1437
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,680
recently supported NATO's information

1438
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,710
fusion cell during the exercise Trident

1439
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,830
juncture 2018 I would not like to invite

1440
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:06,770
major Nichols to the stage to tell us

1441
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:08,960
more about T G 2018 and he has worked

1442
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:11,030
for the 70mm Brigade thank you very much

1443
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,800
for the kind introduction and also I

1444
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,430
started a few Frankie's first one to

1445
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,080
NATO

1446
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,430
PDD because I want to talk about some of

1447
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,009
the work we did together as part of the

1448
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:21,080
information infusion cell and also to

1449
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:22,310
the CCDC Oh a friend having me down here

1450
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,319
as a speaker thank you very much it's a

1451
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:26,420
privilege and obviously it's my first

1452
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,400
saikhan over the first of many if we

1453
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:31,130
continue to go forward I think it's also

1454
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,070
worth noting today as well but I am the

1455
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:35,270
minority are on a almost full female

1456
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,160
exclusive panel today some very

1457
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:38,750
privileged to be part of that and to

1458
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,960
give my little piece as we go forward if

1459
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:43,280
I can yeah so I have been looking at the

1460
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,320
online information bar for about

1461
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,540
two-and-a-half years now particularly

1462
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50,510
around the Enhanced for presents Baltic

1463
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:52,040
Air Policing and looking in sporting try

1464
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,780
and drink show 2018 which what I'm going

1465
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,370
to talk about but what a good talk about

1466
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,780
it's probably the tip of the iceberg I

1467
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,549
can't as a military organization

1468
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,740
standard today and talk about all the

1469
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:03,140
stuff we do but I'm very happy to share

1470
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:06,439
with you my experiences in supporting

1471
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:09,410
the IFC in Oslo during excise trend

1472
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,640
range to 2018 so I think what we've

1473
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:12,379
heard a last sort of day and a half

1474
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,629
really is a lot of theories and a lot of

1475
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,790
concepts and experiments that people

1476
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:18,500
have been conducting but the angle I'm

1477
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:20,750
going to come out from really is that

1478
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,490
military application of the

1479
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:24,890
methodologies and analysis that we've

1480
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:29,209
been learning very well from a sort of

1481
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:30,410
panel before so service every gate if

1482
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,790
you've googled us you've probably read a

1483
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,279
lot about us and not all of it's true

1484
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:35,570
but you know what I'm actually intention

1485
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,610
to do with my team is we're trying to

1486
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:40,070
understand malign activity in the

1487
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:42,800
information environment so we're trying

1488
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:45,470
to understand it by using data analytics

1489
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,910
social network analysis from a

1490
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,169
quantitative perspective and we're also

1491
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,790
trying to look at it from a qualitative

1492
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:52,580
angle as well we're trying to use

1493
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:54,320
cultural experts who understand you know

1494
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,730
that what what potential adverse user

1495
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,040
sayings those audiences and trying to

1496
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,940
connect all that together

1497
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,470
but really what we're trying to work out

1498
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:03,400
is the conversation their narrative

1499
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:05,169
who's saying what to who

1500
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,940
what platform or channels we'll be

1501
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:08,650
talking about it on why are we doing it

1502
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,990
because they're doing it for a reason

1503
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,880
and we're not here trying to protect

1504
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,859
people because I think dr. Lin made an

1505
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,690
excellent point yesterday is some people

1506
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:17,710
don't want protecting in this space in

1507
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,900
which they would do with the computer

1508
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:21,910
but we're really trying to allow freedom

1509
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,289
of speech and democracy to actually go

1510
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,629
along and most importantly make sure

1511
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:27,309
that our message is heard when we

1512
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,749
communicated it and it doesn't get

1513
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:31,150
interfere which allows people to make

1514
01:00:28,749 --> 01:00:32,379
their own decisions about what they want

1515
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,480
to believe rather than really sort of

1516
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,329
disinformation so that's the sort of

1517
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:40,960
angular I come out with really with us

1518
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:43,269
our supporting NATO so we're invited to

1519
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,359
support NATO's information violent

1520
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:47,499
assessment that's part of our IFC now

1521
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:48,640
they break it down into three sort of

1522
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:50,618
areas that they're really interested in

1523
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,868
looking at they want to know their own

1524
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:54,009
communications they want to know how

1525
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:56,019
they're doing from there sort of

1526
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:58,480
flagship accounts or things on Facebook

1527
01:00:56,019 --> 01:01:00,609
or Twitter or YouTube but it's a

1528
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,990
definitely a NATO message right then

1529
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:04,299
they were concerned about sort of what

1530
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,828
the earned aspect was going to be you

1531
01:01:04,299 --> 01:01:07,150
know and we're talking really about sort

1532
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,739
of positive amplification of the

1533
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,390
narrative and what NATO was interested

1534
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:12,039
in and we account for that and there

1535
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:13,118
where my expertise came in with my team

1536
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:14,470
was looking at that hostile

1537
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,710
communication the people are trying to

1538
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:19,238
interfere with us and particularly and

1539
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:21,880
not limited to you know disinformation

1540
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:24,640
and the and the attempts of a propaganda

1541
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,559
network to undermine our efforts as an

1542
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,640
organisation to communicate in that

1543
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:32,019
sphere and although technically we're

1544
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,879
not doing cyber we're looking at

1545
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:35,738
information operations enabled by cyber

1546
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,940
you know the the cyber domain that I'm

1547
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:37,900
looking into is the information

1548
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,180
environment and the information

1549
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:42,309
environment is really complex

1550
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:45,098
it's contested and it's definitely

1551
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:47,739
congested right and I think this sort of

1552
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:48,819
picks up what the Herculean challenge

1553
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:50,079
that we're facing when we're looking at

1554
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:51,670
that information environment now we've

1555
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,289
got the surface where the deep web and

1556
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:55,480
the dark web that people have talked

1557
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:56,829
about previously a lot of the tools that

1558
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,339
people talk about are always sort of

1559
01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:01,450
resonating around the surface web you

1560
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:02,920
know about what's happening on Twitter

1561
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:05,230
on a particular news page but but some

1562
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,549
it gets to that stage an adversary's

1563
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:08,499
pretty ology done the damage or it's

1564
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:10,239
done it's seeding campaign as a chef and

1565
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:11,589
as Rainey talked about where's all that

1566
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:12,910
information has already been put out

1567
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:14,920
there in weeks or months in advance

1568
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:16,810
before it comes to the surface where we

1569
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,850
see it and we start to report on it

1570
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:20,080
and noting in there as well that you're

1571
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,390
never actually gonna be able to dominate

1572
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,290
the information environment you know I

1573
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:25,000
think you've got to be really smart

1574
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:25,840
we've got a time and place of our

1575
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,340
choosing

1576
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,500
we've got to be able to contest that

1577
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,030
space for that particular operation

1578
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,130
because that's what I'm really focused

1579
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,180
on is the operational context of how

1580
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:35,860
we're going to deliver those information

1581
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:37,899
operations and particularly the

1582
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,670
audiences but why were we doing that

1583
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,990
well we're doing it for a couple of

1584
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,460
reasons and one of the first things

1585
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:46,120
we're trying to do is try to help NATO

1586
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:48,640
in having decision a quicker decision

1587
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,870
cycle in the information space we're

1588
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,450
also supporting them in giving them

1589
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:54,460
situational awareness both for that

1590
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:56,560
tactical level operational and at the

1591
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,760
strategic space and we're also trying to

1592
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,590
help need to improve in their

1593
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,900
communications against adversaries in

1594
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:04,240
this particular space so how did we do

1595
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:05,830
that well actually in the IFC in Oslo it

1596
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,640
wasn't just my team and a few others

1597
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:08,650
there was a lot of other nations

1598
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,240
contributing but we had a lot of

1599
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:12,340
specialists a lot of people who did data

1600
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,049
science or they were real sort of cyber

1601
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,520
people who did the ones and zeroes for

1602
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:17,080
us or there was other people who made

1603
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,850
more tech focused or had software

1604
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,160
solutions as well as you traditional

1605
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:22,750
analysts cultural specialists and

1606
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,149
linguists and the whole point was to

1607
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,190
fuse all these people together and try

1608
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:28,900
different methodologies and different

1609
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:31,390
experiments and try and work out what

1610
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:33,520
would work in this space because I don't

1611
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,109
think at this moment in time that there

1612
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,270
is a silver bullet or a one-stop

1613
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:38,170
solution to try and understand what's

1614
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:40,060
happening in that information

1615
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:41,560
environment I think it's far too complex

1616
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,120
for that and as we go through these

1617
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,130
experiments and understanding we need to

1618
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,750
change and adapt our methodologies and

1619
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:49,330
fuse them to try and work out what's

1620
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,800
actually happening in this so some of

1621
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:53,259
the limitations we sort of observe what

1622
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,240
we're there mention the surface versus

1623
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,140
the deep web so most of the tools if

1624
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,000
you're talking about like social

1625
01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:00,310
listening you know all focused around

1626
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,710
that surface web but as we identified

1627
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:04,120
before in NATO Stratcom center of

1628
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:07,630
excellence has done some really really

1629
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:09,160
great research on how hostile nations

1630
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,900
would conduct information operations and

1631
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,279
they do a lot of that in the deep web so

1632
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,260
I'd disconnect from understanding what

1633
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:17,530
was occurring on the deep web was it was

1634
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:19,180
quite limiting actually BOTS there's

1635
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:21,100
good there's bad and is hybrid I'm gonna

1636
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,899
talk more about them later but actually

1637
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,100
understanding how they played a part in

1638
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,470
this information space was quite

1639
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,210
interesting also talk about vulnerable

1640
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:30,098
audiences people that might be persuaded

1641
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:31,900
by disinformation or prop

1642
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:34,059
can the campaigns really hard to

1643
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,739
identify these people online and what

1644
01:04:34,059 --> 01:04:37,239
they actually look like because many

1645
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,680
people present themselves differently in

1646
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:41,170
the information space as they would do

1647
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,759
physically as individual and again we

1648
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:44,049
touched on the methodologies you know

1649
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:45,819
everyone bringing together different

1650
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:47,339
methods trying to adapt and change

1651
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:49,450
infuse that was quite challenging

1652
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:52,029
without knowing what the solution might

1653
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:53,348
be and we think both speakers have

1654
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:55,089
talked about attribution today really

1655
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:57,279
difficult you hear me talking today

1656
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:58,660
about hostile or adversaries I'm not I'm

1657
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:00,460
not naming anyone particular because I

1658
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,558
don't think I can I can just say that

1659
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,180
this you know there were certain tactics

1660
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,999
or techniques that would present

1661
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:08,140
themselves to be a particular person or

1662
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:09,459
state but we couldn't actually do that

1663
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,598
because attribution is really difficult

1664
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:12,549
in this space we just know that they

1665
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:14,380
were against NATO they were against the

1666
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:16,180
communication that we were trying to put

1667
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:18,640
out and one of the other things well

1668
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:20,140
from a NATO perspective is information

1669
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,569
operations isn't really aligned with

1670
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:24,038
cyber operations or cyber Nail enabled

1671
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:26,380
operations which really gave us a

1672
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:28,269
disadvantage against other adversaries

1673
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,609
who do fuse those capabilities together

1674
01:05:28,269 --> 01:05:31,868
and allow them to be one function so

1675
01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:34,479
you're almost not in a fair fine just

1676
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:35,890
not with and this isn't a negative

1677
01:05:34,479 --> 01:05:37,479
obviously we're transparent as an

1678
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,828
alliance you know we have transparency

1679
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:40,899
is one of the sort of the main

1680
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:43,390
objectives and we abide by the laws and

1681
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,589
policies set forth by democracy but

1682
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:47,259
actually again that gives us an unfair

1683
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:48,788
advantage rightly or wrongly that our

1684
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:51,160
adversaries might have a better freedom

1685
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:52,989
of movement or ability to navigate the

1686
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,299
nuances in this space as it's

1687
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:56,410
unregulated and the other one touching

1688
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:57,609
on social media companies you know

1689
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,288
social media companies in the wake of

1690
01:05:57,609 --> 01:06:01,749
things like Cambridge analytical or

1691
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:03,519
other events not too keen on talking to

1692
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,959
government organisations anyway but

1693
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,999
actually what we're interested in is the

1694
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,400
stuff they're also interested in that

1695
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:11,950
propaganda right and and the targeting

1696
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,940
of vulnerable audiences so surely in the

1697
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,710
future to be a better way of working

1698
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:19,210
more collaborative together rather than

1699
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:20,920
keeping as a distance so the network of

1700
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,099
a network up here this is it's

1701
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,059
deliberately small so you can't see it

1702
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:27,339
but there's a whole part of us trying to

1703
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:28,719
understand a propaganda network and and

1704
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:30,759
really try to map out how it

1705
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:31,809
communicates so we look at the nodes in

1706
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:33,759
the Middle's of the clusters and the

1707
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:35,049
supporting elements as well as the

1708
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:36,940
bridging nodes though in important ones

1709
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:39,700
that try and connect those ecosystems or

1710
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:42,729
echo chambers between that so that is a

1711
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,819
surface web sort of understanding ok so

1712
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:45,669
there's nothing on the Deep Web

1713
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,690
but it looked really complicated already

1714
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,040
so one of the bits that would be really

1715
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:50,930
interesting to look at would be that

1716
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:53,000
social media sort of interaction or

1717
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:54,799
mapping behind that as well because if

1718
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,990
you took one of those dots one URL or

1719
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,400
one warm web domain you can imagine then

1720
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:00,080
as a said well like when we put before

1721
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,970
there's a whole social media network

1722
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,350
behind it whether that's Instagram

1723
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:04,910
accounts which were accounts whatever is

1724
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:06,290
gonna be but they're going to share that

1725
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:08,390
around as well so behind each of those

1726
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:11,240
nodes you can superimpose even more

1727
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:12,259
complexity it just reinforces you know

1728
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,520
that this isn't going to be a simple

1729
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:15,050
solution nor are we going to solve it

1730
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,130
today it's going to be enduring and

1731
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:18,260
we're gonna have to keep on adapting as

1732
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:19,430
we push forward and one of the other

1733
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,900
things you can't do with this is show

1734
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:22,490
your bosses that this is what I found

1735
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,390
and and this is how we're gonna win the

1736
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:24,500
war right because they're just going to

1737
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:26,509
laugh you out the office as they do

1738
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,460
normally with me so I have to put it

1739
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:31,430
into simpler format to understand what

1740
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:33,080
that network actually does so first off

1741
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:34,609
we wanted to quantify the problem what

1742
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,200
were we looking at well we knew we had a

1743
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:38,300
network it was a propaganda network and

1744
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,589
it was possibly targeting NATO so you

1745
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,270
look back at what they were doing we

1746
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,160
really wanted to look at the sort of

1747
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:45,290
top-level narratives the the key

1748
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,670
takeaways that they were looking at and

1749
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:49,340
no surprise that they were looking at

1750
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:53,210
geopolitical events things around us UK

1751
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:54,440
Syria Ukraine Germany a particular time

1752
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:56,120
as well because they were quite heavy

1753
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,650
and financing the exercise and if you

1754
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:02,569
look right over on your left slide you

1755
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:05,360
see exercise trying to 18 really small

1756
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:06,470
subsets right of the actual data doesn't

1757
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,940
mean it's not important it just means

1758
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:10,220
that it's a lower down priority possibly

1759
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:11,780
but actually the exercise is a subset of

1760
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:14,060
NATO so if you look at NATO in there

1761
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:16,130
it's got 1164 sort of mentions in a

1762
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:18,529
two-week period so actually it's a

1763
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,910
subset it's quite a big target compared

1764
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:22,759
to other things but ultimately it will

1765
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:25,460
always get beaten by bigger geopolitical

1766
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:27,410
events so what so when we sort of had a

1767
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:29,120
little bit more look at the data for the

1768
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:30,830
bosses we started to map it against

1769
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,309
other exercises we'd seen before to try

1770
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:36,049
and route it in some sort of analysis so

1771
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,790
we have a look at other exercises but no

1772
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:39,769
exercise have been as big as this before

1773
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:41,930
from NATO stretched over at least not in

1774
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:43,970
a long time so we only had recent things

1775
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:46,640
to look out for either big US exercises

1776
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:47,720
or smaller native exercises but as you

1777
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,180
can see the blue line that runs on the

1778
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,460
top that is exercise trying to injure 18

1779
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,930
and the spikes are quite different there

1780
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,810
are other exercises that we looked at

1781
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,620
before so this is the propaganda network

1782
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:59,720
engaging with the

1783
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:02,029
content or the the subject of the

1784
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,710
exercise and the real interesting ones

1785
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:05,450
the big spike in the middle is the

1786
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,850
distinguished visitors day so normally

1787
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:09,290
and the adversarial network wouldn't

1788
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:10,730
communicate all talk about the

1789
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:13,220
distinguished visitors day they'd leave

1790
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:14,209
us alone but this time they wanted to

1791
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,650
talk to us and they wanted to engage

1792
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:19,130
with us and they really used sort of a

1793
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:20,450
sort of amplified content rightly or

1794
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,620
wrongly for them but they really sort of

1795
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,269
pushed around the place for us and

1796
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,559
there's a second spike right the end of

1797
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:26,900
the graphic we hadn't seen before and

1798
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,330
the other exercises which was linked to

1799
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:31,549
an alleged and I do say alleged jamming

1800
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:33,769
or interference by Russia documented in

1801
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:35,480
the news trying to jam airwaves etc

1802
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:37,130
towards the end of the exercise and

1803
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:39,019
again that was amplified quite

1804
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,580
significantly so we thought well maybe

1805
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,050
there's a little bit more malign

1806
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,309
happening here because it's not

1807
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,110
following the normal trends that we'd

1808
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,950
seen before

1809
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:47,839
before did that we had a quick look at

1810
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,580
languages so that network as we

1811
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,590
identified talked in different languages

1812
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,970
and no surprise that English is right up

1813
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,680
there because you know the international

1814
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:57,530
media was talking in English at that

1815
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,910
moment in time and I put the the d-day

1816
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:00,170
which is the Sally exercise just for

1817
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:02,660
reference on there so you can see what's

1818
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:03,680
happening but the real interesting point

1819
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,000
in that I think is the difference

1820
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,310
between English the blue line and

1821
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,260
Russian the red line so when this

1822
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:11,270
network talked in English for example it

1823
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:14,630
would drop off its narrative in Russian

1824
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:16,250
and vice-versa so it's quite indicative

1825
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:18,110
of something that's maybe targeted or

1826
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,940
coordinated or definitely has a level of

1827
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:21,980
priority that it wants to focus on that

1828
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,299
particular day so really we starting to

1829
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,540
unpack it and then you'll see the Green

1830
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,670
Line

1831
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,590
Arabic which links into sort of the

1832
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:30,140
Syria focus so this network accumulates

1833
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,550
in multiple languages and you know

1834
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,810
chooses what it wants to focus on that

1835
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:34,400
particular day which comes from for some

1836
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:36,110
of the complexities you know you really

1837
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,120
need to understand linguist capabilities

1838
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,920
in cultural understanding about what the

1839
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,230
adversaries might be doing to try and

1840
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,670
undermine you so as we were going

1841
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:46,190
through that we kind of stumbled across

1842
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:47,960
this I suppose we didn't really start to

1843
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:52,099
look out for BOTS and I'm going to talk

1844
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,080
a lot a lot about BOTS in a second we

1845
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,940
just looked at the Twittersphere and we

1846
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,380
just looked at to hash to handles right

1847
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,849
what was at NATO and the other ones at

1848
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,640
NATO press which are two flagship

1849
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:03,320
accounts okay and the dots that you

1850
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,390
would see their representative BOTS so

1851
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,799
pink dots of BOTS there's bots that

1852
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,140
follow bots humans that full of bots and

1853
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,520
bots that follow humans right it's all I

1854
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,770
can say a lot of bots so

1855
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,000
that's that's a little bit of a cluster

1856
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:15,470
it just showed all this artificial

1857
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,060
amplification that was coming in that we

1858
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:20,990
hadn't seen before using one of our

1859
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:23,510
tools and there was 422 BOTS that were

1860
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:25,280
engaging with this content okay now

1861
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:26,630
there's good there's bad in his hybrid

1862
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,759
BOTS right so there's gonna be good BOTS

1863
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:30,650
like news channels that use pipe

1864
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,540
encoding just to assist to get you know

1865
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:34,070
information out into that sphere but

1866
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,540
there's also people are using it from a

1867
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:37,519
lion activity and that was the real

1868
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,930
challenge trying to pick that apart but

1869
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,990
we wanted to quantify it again by having

1870
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:42,890
a look at other periods of time so we

1871
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:44,360
could see there there was another

1872
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:46,070
exercise at beginning the year called

1873
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:48,139
saber strike at us-led exercise and

1874
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:50,120
there's only 74 BOTS using the same

1875
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:51,080
parameters but you might be saying Jeff

1876
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,400
you know what they probably delete some

1877
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,890
of those accounts so it's probably not a

1878
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,420
good reference or measurement right from

1879
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,860
a data point of view so I'll take that

1880
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,630
but then we looked at an exercise peered

1881
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:02,089
right before sorry in non exercise

1882
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:04,250
period right before trunk juncture and

1883
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:08,510
there was only 16 BOTS using the same

1884
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:09,950
parameters before there was then 422 so

1885
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:11,120
then you know the conclusion of the

1886
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,710
deduction there really is well these

1887
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,830
things were created specifically to

1888
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:17,870
engage with these handles possibly or at

1889
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:19,220
least engage with this exercise and they

1890
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:21,890
had short lifespans because they do get

1891
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:23,390
shut down eventually right and that is a

1892
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:25,880
proven fact so we looked a little bit

1893
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:27,860
more into that possible synthetic

1894
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,750
amplification of those accounts so

1895
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:31,820
there's three lines talk one the blue

1896
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:33,230
line is you know what were class one is

1897
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:35,780
unique bot accounts are engaging with

1898
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:38,450
NATO handles again within that a caveat

1899
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,920
was good bad and hybrid we then looked

1900
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,360
at negative engagement and that was

1901
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,730
sentiment driven and I know there's

1902
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,099
loads of issues with sentiment analysis

1903
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:47,480
and optimization of that but what we did

1904
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,160
was we went through a selection of it

1905
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,230
and we manchala klieg got our cultural

1906
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,430
experts to go good comment bad comment

1907
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:55,190
good comment bad comment all the way

1908
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:56,450
through and quantified it like that so

1909
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:57,650
then you can see the between the blue

1910
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,660
and the red line that actually there was

1911
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:01,309
a negative rise in engagement of those

1912
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:03,950
handles the following day after the

1913
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,470
distinguished visitors day a correlation

1914
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:08,389
we then ran a bot life cycle underneath

1915
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:10,160
that to have a look at it and you can

1916
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:11,780
see the green is following the green

1917
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,280
line stories one bot through its

1918
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:15,500
lifespan through the exercise and you

1919
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:18,320
can see there is correlation between the

1920
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,360
life is activity and the driving up of

1921
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,929
the negative sentiment sentiment against

1922
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,730
NATO

1923
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:24,340
now that's one bot we tried it against

1924
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,959
lots of bots and they all had a very

1925
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,220
similar pattern of life now these bots

1926
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,660
were like quick burner ones they got

1927
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:31,480
shut down probably about 48 hours

1928
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,620
afterwards once this had occurred so we

1929
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:35,049
had a theory that they've probably got

1930
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,730
two levels to two types of bot networks

1931
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,560
one is sort of the enduring element the

1932
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:40,240
hybrid bot that has a bit of a profile a

1933
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,680
bit adapt to it and then they hand off

1934
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,840
to more nefarious I'm a live one that

1935
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,280
has a short lifespan in cycle and then

1936
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,600
they go and do the maligned stuff insert

1937
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:50,110
other things to try and change the

1938
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,400
narrative which I'll cover shortly but

1939
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:54,820
going back to what we talked about with

1940
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:56,410
NATO and the information environment

1941
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,820
assessment so they really want to work

1942
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,460
out you know there was their own there

1943
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:01,750
was the earned and then there was the

1944
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:04,320
hostile communication so we wanted to

1945
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:06,490
look at the top 250 communicators online

1946
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,900
using the data that we particularly had

1947
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:10,150
and you can see the blue segment on that

1948
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:12,639
pie chart covers NATO six percent of the

1949
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:15,339
information space or the top 250 was

1950
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,800
dominated by them and the hostile was 4%

1951
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:19,390
do you think at that pace we've probably

1952
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,590
got domination of that information space

1953
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:22,390
particularly when you look at the earned

1954
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:25,270
which was represented by about 34

1955
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:26,500
percent however if we just look at a

1956
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:28,960
hostile and just look at the for any

1957
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,760
communications and you add in the bots

1958
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,410
which we know we're doing Millian

1959
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,970
activities against us actually you're

1960
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:36,670
again in an unfair advantage because

1961
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:38,980
using artificial amplification to change

1962
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,720
the narrative in stirs so already they

1963
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,129
were more up like 16 percent of the sort

1964
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,600
of narrative control versus the six

1965
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:46,210
percent that NATO had available to them

1966
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,920
because we were sticking to transparency

1967
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:49,840
alliance and we weren't going to conduct

1968
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,680
cyber-enabled information operations and

1969
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,440
we were going to do what we've always

1970
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,150
done which was communicate you know on

1971
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,549
on those official channels rather than

1972
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:58,719
maybe taking a slightly different tact

1973
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:00,580
in line with all your policies but to

1974
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:04,660
try and break out of those type of

1975
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:06,160
spheres so what does it actually look

1976
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,690
like we came up with this theory then

1977
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,070
with the Norwegians and the Swedish and

1978
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:11,349
I make it very clear because obviously

1979
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:13,990
there's water more than just NATO so we

1980
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:15,400
had this theory base in the bots so they

1981
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,929
had a three-phase operation there's a

1982
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:20,860
shaping and maneuver phase and an

1983
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:22,150
exploitation phase so the narrative that

1984
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,099
we would try to push out through our own

1985
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:26,080
channels would come across and it would

1986
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:28,150
get picked up by what would be BOTS or

1987
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,440
other accounts right but then the theory

1988
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:32,259
was that they were amplified and

1989
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,309
diverted and overridden by those malign

1990
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,960
activities right so they were

1991
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:36,430
controlling us and if you look at this

1992
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,050
from an analogy like you're almost

1993
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:39,849
passing the ball over to the other

1994
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,050
at this moment we got the ball we pass

1995
01:15:39,849 --> 01:15:42,460
it along we think you passing it to a

1996
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:44,230
teammate but you're not because it's

1997
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:45,969
gone across to you adversary and what

1998
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:48,098
they did with it and if we go back to

1999
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:49,210
the two bot networks first bot amplifies

2000
01:15:48,099 --> 01:15:50,860
it and you think you didn't really good

2001
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:52,929
because they seem like legitimate

2002
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,058
accounts but then that Network hands off

2003
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:57,400
to another network which is the maligned

2004
01:15:55,059 --> 01:15:59,469
Network and that feeds off and pushes it

2005
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,030
to one side and pushes your narrative in

2006
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:03,280
a different direction away from your

2007
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:05,110
audiences but gives you the feeling that

2008
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,210
maybe you're achieving good statistics

2009
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:08,650
because you've got you know a high reach

2010
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:10,960
or there's more people clicking through

2011
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:12,489
your particular content what was really

2012
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,780
interesting when we had that override

2013
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:15,489
function with the sort of the red arrow

2014
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:18,159
coming down was the insertion of other

2015
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:19,869
sort of hashtags and this in Twitter

2016
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:22,420
instances where it's talking about you

2017
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:24,549
know expansion NATO is expanding its

2018
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,260
borders and and to Robert your comments

2019
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:28,179
aimed at NATO these other accounts were

2020
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,920
inserting these hashtags in and taking

2021
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:31,270
control that narrative and pushing in

2022
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,280
this completely different direction for

2023
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:35,469
us and it took us a while to really work

2024
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,550
that out because one we mentioned before

2025
01:16:35,469 --> 01:16:38,050
the information about it was really

2026
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,670
complex and contested and congested and

2027
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:41,590
we just didn't know about this just

2028
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:42,730
didn't see it until we started having a

2029
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,920
look around and trying to understand it

2030
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,940
with all the mixed methodologies so

2031
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,070
that's one of the things we're gonna try

2032
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:49,239
and take forward with NATO and try to

2033
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,650
understand how we push into that

2034
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:54,940
information space in the near future so

2035
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:57,070
that was my experiences on trend restore

2036
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:59,348
18 I'm going to finish with two to final

2037
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:01,960
points if I can about what I think we

2038
01:16:59,349 --> 01:17:03,460
could do better in the future and the

2039
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,110
first one I think as I mentioned one of

2040
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:07,150
the limitations was the surface web in

2041
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:08,019
the Deep Web right so we're very good at

2042
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:09,339
understanding what happens on the

2043
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,599
surface we have been probably not so

2044
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:13,030
good at understanding what happens on

2045
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:14,440
the Deep Web but it's two points one we

2046
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:16,150
need to be better at that deep web

2047
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,379
analysis and all the points that Renee

2048
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,388
picked up before about how our

2049
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:21,159
adversary's operate in that space but

2050
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:22,690
critically when we when we understand

2051
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:24,460
that deep web we've got to make the

2052
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:26,530
connection between the Deep Web and that

2053
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,179
surface web because the network will be

2054
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:29,199
connected right this isn't just

2055
01:17:28,179 --> 01:17:30,909
mysteriously pop-up there will be

2056
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:32,169
connections and fee points back up there

2057
01:17:30,909 --> 01:17:34,210
and if we can understand how the full

2058
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:35,440
network actually operates then we might

2059
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,690
be able to do something in the future to

2060
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,199
actually to combat that space as we go

2061
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,119
forward

2062
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:42,339
I suppose the second point where I think

2063
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:44,440
we could do better in this space would

2064
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:46,659
be you know that alignment of

2065
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,369
cyber-enabled information operations

2066
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:49,808
because if we don't change what we

2067
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,559
currently do possibly in our in our

2068
01:17:49,809 --> 01:17:51,820
tactic

2069
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,170
then we're always going to kind of be

2070
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,790
behind the adversary's in this space

2071
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,560
because they're already ahead of us and

2072
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:57,699
as was mentioned earlier while we were

2073
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,489
sort of ferreting counter-insurgency

2074
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:02,769
Warfare's in other countries our

2075
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:04,330
adversaries invested heavily in digital

2076
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:06,310
marketing so they might be ten years

2077
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:07,840
ahead of us at this space so we really

2078
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:09,550
need to refocus on to how we're going to

2079
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,590
align that and maybe we look at digital

2080
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,989
marketing as an example of how we could

2081
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:23,110
do better information operations online

2082
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:25,299
thank you thank you very much Jeff for

2083
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:27,309
such an insightful presentation do we

2084
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:34,360
have any questions from the audience to

2085
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:43,330
Jeff or any other panelists yes please

2086
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:45,820
I know formally what the definition of a

2087
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:48,460
bot is but I'm wondering how you

2088
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:52,719
distinguish between a hundred percent

2089
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:56,140
automation and 25 percent automation or

2090
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:58,840
you know fifty percent or you know human

2091
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:01,989
abusing BOTS just as an amplifier of a

2092
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,930
human being that's behind you know 25

2093
01:19:01,989 --> 01:19:08,650
different BOTS

2094
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:09,940
all right semi BOTS I can answer but

2095
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:13,960
when you go first

2096
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:16,239
I know well in our crude version I think

2097
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:17,530
of what we looked at was we had set

2098
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,120
parameters that was done for us it was

2099
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:21,009
automatic you know we didn't really have

2100
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,269
much in interaction with it so we had a

2101
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:25,060
program that runs with a side in there

2102
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:26,800
had I think it was 26 unique points of

2103
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,510
measurement as you'd be aware the

2104
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,000
frequency which it tweets it's the times

2105
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:33,130
of tweets and things like this it would

2106
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,270
give us a confidence score I suppose at

2107
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:36,820
the time we have there you can over

2108
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:38,320
simplify and say it's a bot or not and

2109
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:40,480
there's a little bit more to it in

2110
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,130
understanding how they would be done but

2111
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,959
I also think it's really hard as well

2112
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:45,760
even using sort of that autumn ization

2113
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,770
to go I think that could be a bot

2114
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,080
because there's a level there if you

2115
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:51,370
have a high level of confidence you

2116
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,719
might still need a human in the loop and

2117
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,980
if you've got the human loops or needs

2118
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,969
to go and investigate it and then

2119
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,468
there's a whole other raft of issues

2120
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:58,480
that might arise from that and the time

2121
01:19:56,469 --> 01:19:59,710
implication that comes from it so I

2122
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,059
suppose for us in that parameter when we

2123
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:02,890
looked at it we were pretty confident

2124
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:04,120
that if the computer or the algorithm of

2125
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,220
a saint was you know it was above

2126
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:08,680
of 60% confidence that there it was a

2127
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:10,120
bot then we take that as our method in

2128
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,800
that particular experiment that we were

2129
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:19,480
confident that that was most likely to

2130
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:20,260
be a bot and not be anything else thank

2131
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,129
you

2132
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:31,540
any other questions from the audience if

2133
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:33,790
yes please I was very interested with

2134
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:36,070
the fact that you're digging into

2135
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:39,100
anti-vaccine in public health because I

2136
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:41,880
mean historically public health has been

2137
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:44,410
one of the great successes of

2138
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:47,610
communicating accurate information and

2139
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:50,500
and has made some massive progress

2140
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:52,660
looking at actually the horrendous

2141
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:55,090
example what's going on now with the

2142
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:57,490
anti vaccine campaign do you feel like

2143
01:20:55,090 --> 01:21:00,850
we're losing momentum simply because of

2144
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:02,769
a change of technology and catching up

2145
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:05,110
to that or is there something more

2146
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:08,110
fundamental going on yeah I do

2147
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:10,960
um well let me caveat that

2148
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:12,370
so the anti-vaxxer was done in 2015 when

2149
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,740
in california we were trying to pass a

2150
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:17,019
law to eliminate vaccine opt-outs and i

2151
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:18,639
was one of the moms who started the

2152
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:22,240
group to encourage the senate to pass

2153
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:24,130
that law so that was that was done

2154
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:27,340
because I wanted to understand why we

2155
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:29,200
were so behind and why and all the

2156
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:30,640
hashtags about the bill I was

2157
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,769
communicating with the Senators and they

2158
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,900
were telling me you know our bill the

2159
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:36,400
bill is polling in district when I do

2160
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:40,570
town halls and talk to my constituents

2161
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:42,160
at 85% but the social media conversation

2162
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:44,590
I'm getting death threats I'm getting

2163
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,540
harassment I'm getting you know there I

2164
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:48,550
haven't seen a single person on Twitter

2165
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,590
say something positive about this bill

2166
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:51,880
that was what inspired that research it

2167
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:53,350
was me trying to understand what was

2168
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,910
going on there

2169
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:56,440
and the realization that there's an

2170
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,240
asymmetry of passion and truth or

2171
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,160
communities where they are absolutely

2172
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,290
willing to get out there and do this

2173
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,730
whereas vaccination is an interesting

2174
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:06,700
example because as you said it's been

2175
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:09,790
such a success that there are not armies

2176
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:11,470
of true believers who are you know who

2177
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:13,120
are out there saying like I vaccinated

2178
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:15,699
my child and nothing happened how great

2179
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,710
are vaccines right and so

2180
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:18,910
but but this is you know it's it's funny

2181
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,860
but at the same time this is where you

2182
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:21,940
get flat earthers you don't have people

2183
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,650
sitting there tweeting about how the

2184
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:25,210
earth is round you don't have people

2185
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:27,099
tweeting about how the moon landing did

2186
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:28,719
happen you don't have you know I could

2187
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:31,360
go on and on and on and the thing that

2188
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,860
we saw as we began to look at beyond

2189
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,750
Twitter but how the conversation was

2190
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:37,330
playing out on Facebook was the

2191
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:39,100
recommendation engines promoting the

2192
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:41,140
content because that's the content that

2193
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,880
was there to promote the conspiracy

2194
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:45,100
correlation matrix where if somebody has

2195
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,600
a distrust and authority they're more

2196
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,550
likely to believe several different

2197
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,350
types of conspiracy theories and the

2198
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:54,760
recommendation engine picks up Keys off

2199
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:56,920
of that and amplifies it so the malign

2200
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:00,090
narratives of state-sponsored attackers

2201
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:02,530
and the ways in which algorithms

2202
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:04,449
inadvertently amplify truthers what I

2203
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:05,410
was trying to get at and again like I

2204
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:07,059
said I'm a little bit under the weather

2205
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:08,559
today but what I was trying to get at

2206
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:10,150
was the way in which it's it's it's the

2207
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,800
building blocks of the way the social

2208
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:15,420
ecosystem is put together that

2209
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:17,949
facilitates this and that's where we

2210
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:19,929
haven't seen that investment in

2211
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:22,178
counter-messaging same thing with Isis

2212
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:24,640
you know Isis recruiters out there

2213
01:23:22,179 --> 01:23:27,010
talking about the virtual Caliphate the

2214
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,960
US government tweeting think again turn

2215
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:31,630
away from an official State Department

2216
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:34,390
account as if that is somehow compelling

2217
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:37,210
counter-propaganda it's it's just I

2218
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:39,850
don't think we've in 2015 we just

2219
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:42,310
weren't there at understanding really

2220
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:44,650
rudimentary things about mechanics of

2221
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:47,530
distribution but also the need to to

2222
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:51,330
build the investment in in communication

2223
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:54,570
technology on social web thank you any

2224
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,570
yes please

2225
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:03,300
I should offenses Anto senior written

2226
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:05,030
research ITT ha how would the panelists

2227
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:08,550
view if it would take a lot more

2228
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:10,769
aggressive approach so in terms of we're

2229
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:12,719
not defending we don't put out counter

2230
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:15,059
messaging and stuff like that but we

2231
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,699
actually amplify the messages that our

2232
01:24:15,059 --> 01:24:20,010
adversaries use and thereby infiltrate

2233
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:21,839
those networks and then over time gain a

2234
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:24,030
central position those networks then

2235
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,489
turn it around as the last speaker said

2236
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:29,340
in a counter messaging messaging attempt

2237
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:31,259
so rather than trying to destroy the

2238
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:33,090
network from the outside relying on the

2239
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:35,369
part of the sector we try to destroy it

2240
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:38,250
from the inside and then destroy that

2241
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:40,110
trust framework and insert for all the

2242
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:42,360
users in that network the kind of

2243
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:44,250
skepticism or increasing that skepticism

2244
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:47,308
that they can't believe in anything

2245
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:49,050
that's around them because well it might

2246
01:24:47,309 --> 01:24:51,030
be the government it might be the state

2247
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:54,440
it might be law enforcement and so on so

2248
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:59,059
a lot more aggressive and even well I

2249
01:24:54,440 --> 01:25:01,980
don't know how to put it but not well

2250
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:04,110
let's say it's politically not correct

2251
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:05,400
in that sense because you would be would

2252
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:07,170
be essentially doing the work for the

2253
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,480
atmosphere right but then turn it around

2254
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:14,820
at the end say yeah

2255
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:16,230
I would like to start well okay yeah

2256
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:19,079
that's a really good question thank you

2257
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:21,839
and noting these problem I personally is

2258
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:23,880
right so I think the real challenge

2259
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,869
you're gonna face there is well first of

2260
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,309
all should you be more aggressive you

2261
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:28,199
probably should be you know particularly

2262
01:25:26,309 --> 01:25:30,179
with the length some of our adversities

2263
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:31,739
are going to but I don't think you

2264
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:33,119
should come at it just from a real sort

2265
01:25:31,739 --> 01:25:34,440
of official standpoint because if you

2266
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,659
sort of go in try and interfere with

2267
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,489
their network from a NATO or state sort

2268
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:39,539
of perspective are you going to resonate

2269
01:25:38,489 --> 01:25:40,589
with the audience and I think this

2270
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:42,239
always boils down to those audiences

2271
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:43,949
they're gonna believe what you're trying

2272
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,449
to tell them and if you come in in from

2273
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:46,619
a state angle they're probably not gonna

2274
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:48,629
believe you and you're gonna lose that

2275
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:50,969
battle anyway she probably need to find

2276
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:52,170
those people who are more influential as

2277
01:25:50,969 --> 01:25:53,730
when I mentioned some of her species

2278
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:55,920
before those influences within those

2279
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:57,269
networks and not get them to do your

2280
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,280
work for you but you could leverage them

2281
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:01,020
probably a lot more efficiently than we

2282
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,480
are doing right now to try and share the

2283
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:08,010
information and the truthful information

2284
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:10,860
around to get your point across all

2285
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:11,400
right so and this is just recognized and

2286
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,870
kind of like some

2287
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:15,150
the work you were just presenting on

2288
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:18,150
looking within like the african-american

2289
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:19,830
community as well so the communities

2290
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:23,519
that you know are being infiltrated

2291
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:26,790
aren't all like government they're you

2292
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:28,920
know African Americans you know have

2293
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:31,470
this you should be able to you know

2294
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:34,530
discuss issues that relate to them

2295
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:36,300
without worrying about like oh like here

2296
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:37,410
you know like maybe that's IRA maybe

2297
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,820
that's government you know they're

2298
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:42,000
already sort of politically vulnerable

2299
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:45,269
so I would be concerned from an ethical

2300
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,010
point of view about infiltrating it and

2301
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:49,770
basically like taking this politically

2302
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:52,400
vulnerable community within you know the

2303
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:54,570
United States and kind of like kind of

2304
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,730
infiltrating them from both sides I

2305
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:57,900
think it would be I would hope that we

2306
01:26:56,730 --> 01:27:00,299
could come to a solution where that

2307
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:02,309
community could help sort of protect

2308
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:05,280
itself and identify the infiltrators

2309
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:07,320
themselves rather than you know having

2310
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:11,580
to be forced upon them that's my

2311
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:17,969
personal view I am so in the work that

2312
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:20,790
we did in late 2015 on Isis that that

2313
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:22,050
was a obviously had been broached right

2314
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:24,269
it was a but but you have a couple

2315
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:25,380
couple considerations there there's

2316
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,390
capabilities and there's

2317
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:30,150
responsibilities within the US we have

2318
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:32,460
certain laws that actually in many ways

2319
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:34,620
make democracies disproportionately

2320
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,230
vulnerable to these kinds of of attacks

2321
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:39,000
because of certain restrictions that you

2322
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:40,200
know US government has it was it was

2323
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,300
State Department was finding it very

2324
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,820
difficult to do anything with Isis

2325
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:47,130
because it had to declare itself it

2326
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:49,139
couldn't gather social networking data

2327
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:50,910
because it could inadvertently capture

2328
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:52,950
information about American citizens all

2329
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:56,220
right like there so there was a series

2330
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:57,570
of reasons why we were disadvantaged and

2331
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:59,520
so some of the work that we were trying

2332
01:27:57,570 --> 01:28:00,570
to do was to think about how can we in

2333
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,730
the United States come up with a

2334
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:04,710
whole-of-government response to this by

2335
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:07,339
creating centers that work with partners

2336
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:12,000
that handle messaging and you know other

2337
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:15,240
ways for for dealing with it we did in

2338
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,630
the course of that you have to to put

2339
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:22,410
this in context in 2015 we were still

2340
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:24,580
arguing with Twitter suggesting that

2341
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:27,309
they should take down Isis accounts that

2342
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:28,930
not the de facto policy the concern was

2343
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:30,310
one man's terrorist is another man's

2344
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:32,320
freedom fighter and if you take down

2345
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:36,430
Isis accounts like goodness what's next

2346
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:39,780
right and so we were there was a sense

2347
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:42,820
that if you ran like bought against bots

2348
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:46,570
if they were spamming your hash tag you

2349
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:48,190
spam their hash tag and nobody wanted

2350
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:50,950
that to be the future of the internet

2351
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:52,799
and you know and so the question became

2352
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:55,360
could we prevail upon the platforms to

2353
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,550
make headway so that that wasn't the

2354
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:00,880
only Avenue we had available to us and

2355
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:04,090
so even though I was part of those

2356
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:07,390
conversations back in 2015 I really even

2357
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:09,130
at the time we've sincerely hoped that

2358
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:12,700
we could just get the platforms to take

2359
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:17,230
action and I think the one perhaps

2360
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:18,700
silver lining of the 2016 debacle the

2361
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:21,070
internet research agency debacle

2362
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:23,559
specifically was that it did make them

2363
01:29:21,070 --> 01:29:27,250
fundamentally rethink structural flaws

2364
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:28,960
in in their features and their detection

2365
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:31,480
and others realize that they had to

2366
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:33,340
engage with government more and that the

2367
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,929
blanket idea that any speech that went

2368
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,430
up on the internet should stay up was

2369
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:38,470
not the framework that we needed to be

2370
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:40,330
operating in that it shouldn't be you

2371
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:42,250
know bot army screaming against bot army

2372
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:44,380
and a Twitter hashtag anymore so we've

2373
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:48,490
we've made material strides since then

2374
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:50,050
and I hope we continue to thank you one

2375
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:53,830
last question and then unfortunately

2376
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:55,180
we'll have to close hello Laurie

2377
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:58,450
correspond from cyber defense Institute

2378
01:29:55,180 --> 01:30:00,250
in Japan my question is what kind of

2379
01:29:58,450 --> 01:30:03,790
tools do you see available for the

2380
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:07,440
private industry to get the information

2381
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:10,090
about adversaries which have the nation

2382
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,009
national security level impact because

2383
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:13,240
this is not visible to the private

2384
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:15,400
industry but at the same time the

2385
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:19,179
advisers are using the private industry

2386
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:24,339
to attack the whole system what tools

2387
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:26,350
are available are you asking for private

2388
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:30,340
companies that get targeted like Exxon

2389
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:33,320
or something or well any in a situation

2390
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:36,550
when the the whole economy is

2391
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:38,269
tied together between the states and the

2392
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:39,830
pastors okay

2393
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:41,270
so the priorities just have to be able

2394
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:43,880
to defend themselves but what tools

2395
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:47,480
would be available for example to

2396
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:50,210
acquire that intelligence about the

2397
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:56,500
adversaries they should avoid or how to

2398
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:58,970
defend themselves there's a so they're

2399
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:01,190
social listening for brand mentions and

2400
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:04,430
things has been a thing for a while now

2401
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:05,780
I you can you can look at there's a lot

2402
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:08,690
of ways to see that you've been

2403
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:10,460
mentioned 500 times what we're starting

2404
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:11,660
to see and I feel a little bit

2405
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:13,550
conflicted answering this because I

2406
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:16,309
previously worked at a company that did

2407
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:19,370
exactly this called new knowledge there

2408
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:22,720
is now a collection of a number of

2409
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:25,280
companies that focus on trying to help

2410
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:27,050
brands and industries understand what

2411
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,790
happens when they get targeted so

2412
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:34,390
there's new knowledge there is signal

2413
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:36,440
there's let's gush Crimson hexagon a

2414
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:40,340
number of companies that are looking

2415
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:42,919
specifically at how how industry does

2416
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:44,270
get targeted both at a at an individual

2417
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,220
level iterate an individual company

2418
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:48,410
level but also we have seen things like

2419
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,940
anti-fracking campaigns by states with

2420
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:56,630
oil interests and things like that is

2421
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:58,190
that what you're asking i I would be a

2422
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:01,310
little bit more concerned in the

2423
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:03,320
targeted attack through the private

2424
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:06,230
industry against the nation-state

2425
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:07,730
so in this sense it's not a targeting

2426
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:10,519
industry but the state but through the

2427
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:12,799
private industry and the the private

2428
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:15,110
industry wouldn't have knowledge of

2429
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:17,290
which kind of actors would be actually

2430
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:20,210
critical and which might be malignant

2431
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:22,310
towards right sorry that was what I was

2432
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:24,110
maybe I maybe hasn't clear about that

2433
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:25,970
so with brand mentioned tools you can

2434
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:28,519
understand that you've been mentioned a

2435
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:30,800
lot with this sort of new wave of social

2436
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,930
intelligence tools the goal is to help

2437
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,990
you understand you know are they likely

2438
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:37,640
to be bots where did the accounts come

2439
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:39,410
from what are the factions look like

2440
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,820
it's just an extra degree of

2441
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:43,220
sophistication that layers social

2442
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:45,230
network analysis techniques into that

2443
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:46,820
into that process so there are

2444
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:47,329
commercially available solutions out

2445
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:51,018
there

2446
01:32:47,329 --> 01:32:53,989
for just this sort of thing now great

2447
01:32:51,019 --> 01:32:56,239
thank you so much to our panelists it's

2448
01:32:53,989 --> 01:32:58,218
such a fascinating topic I hope we can

2449
01:32:56,239 --> 01:33:00,499
pick up some of the points made by our

2450
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:03,169
panelists during the coffee break and

2451
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:05,209
discuss this further I think this is a

2452
01:33:03,169 --> 01:33:06,919
very complicated and challenging topic

2453
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:09,769
but we do have our best minds working on

2454
01:33:06,919 --> 01:33:11,689
it so we can browse Eve please join me

2455
01:33:09,769 --> 01:33:13,100
in thanking our wonderful panelists for

2456
