1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,279
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,139
welcome back welcome back to - saikhan I

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,570
trust you've had a good time - to relax

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,790
to network and you're ready to push on

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,300
with what we have planned for you this

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:22,198
afternoon so this session is titled

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,029
cyber deterrence in NATO and deterrence

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,090
has indeed been one of the buzzwords of

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,769
the conference today we've discussed it

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,380
from the strategic perspective we

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,469
discuss it from the very practical IOT

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,750
perspective and many other angles so I I

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,640
trust that the fans of deterrence issues

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,590
are very happy with the conference so

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:47,940
far and ready to push on before I get to

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,820
our panel I'll briefly introduce why

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,399
we're discussing this issue here and the

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,680
reason is really that NATO is

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:01,829
celebrating its 70th 1775 anniversary

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,449
but the moment when deterrence could

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,549
have been considered it to be a comment

22
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,950
the alliance topics can be dated back

23
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,060
five years when NATO at its wealth

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,740
summit agreed that the principles of one

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,439
for all and all for one apply in

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,000
cyberspace and the past five years we've

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,380
also seen that the cyber attacks are

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,360
there they're getting worse they are

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,689
targeting us in a increasingly diverse

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,670
perspectives angles but what we are with

31
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,850
what we haven't seen is really anyone

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,479
going at large at NATO as such so it

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,839
might be a good moment to ask really is

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,780
cyber it channels working or not earlier

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,549
today we've seen the Estonian presidents

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,040
announced the five principles that

37
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,869
Estonia now adheres to when it comes to

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,630
States behavior in cyberspace and we've

39
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,540
also learned how the military approach

40
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,140
to that in a different countries has

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,280
been but now to our distinguished panel

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,050
and moderator I am in a very comfortable

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,489
position that I really don't need to

44
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,710
introduce any of the speakers because

45
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,400
what you watch is who you

46
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,770
see on stage are really distinguished

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,810
experts in their area but I will do that

48
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,250
anyway on my immediate left is dr.

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,790
Antonio Missy Rowley is the Assistant

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:34,800
Secretary General of NATO including for

51
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:38,250
cyber well doctor mr. Rowley is a well

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,700
known name before he entered NATO as the

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,770
ASG he has written extensively on

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,760
European security has worked with the

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,390
European Commission

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,140
he had a academic career a career in

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:56,309
journalism he holds a PhD in history

58
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,980
so welcome sir - saikhan our next

59
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,220
speaker is Jason Healy from Columbia

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,660
University again I wouldn't be able to

61
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:09,320
count all his career here let's just say

62
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:14,060
that he's one of the leading analysts

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:17,190
there is in my humble opinion and also

64
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,430
he was speaking about attribution long

65
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,700
before anyone else did just as as to

66
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,480
other ties and to his left is Professor

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,119
Duncan Hollis from Temple University Law

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,100
School in Philadelphia again professor

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,880
Hollis doesn't really need a long

70
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,450
introduction one of the things that he

71
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,670
is currently working with is with the

72
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,910
Organization of American States where

73
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,720
his primary tasks and responsibilities

74
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:51,570
to really enhance the transparency when

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,530
it comes to cyber operations and the

76
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,140
role of states they're in and as a

77
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,120
administrative remark we will follow the

78
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,250
more or less classical approach to a

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,000
panel discussion

80
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,250
for starters we will have opening

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,830
statements plantations from all the

82
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,990
speakers and the later part of the panel

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,770
we will entertain questions from the

84
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:22,950
audience so please pay attention think

85
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,870
along and be ready with some creative

86
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,080
questions in the later parts of this

87
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,080
session

88
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:35,470
and to really get us going quickly I

89
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:38,349
will give first the floor to dr. mr. Roy

90
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,349
I'm sorry please thank you good

91
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:43,930
afternoon everyone it's a great pleasure

92
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:46,479
to be back at saikhan it is actually my

93
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,509
second cap I have to say that the

94
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,210
weather last year was better been never

95
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,580
like to congratulate the CCDC OE for

96
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,520
this event it's a great success some

97
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,710
extent cyclone is becoming a victim of

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,320
its own success doing due to the large

99
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,380
numbers of participants let me start by

100
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,620
saying that the Terrance in general is a

101
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,930
core element of NATO's overall strategy

102
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,880
to provide for the collective defense of

103
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,949
their lives and over the past five years

104
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,960
in fact the NATO has taken its most

105
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,940
significant steps since the end of the

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,729
Cold War to strengthen is that that is

107
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,880
posture NATO is now able to respond to a

108
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,409
crisis more rapidly than ever it test

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,080
focus their efforts on conventional

110
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:32,289
forces forward presence including in

111
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,448
this country joint airpower and maritime

112
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:37,599
forces as well as countering what we

113
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:40,030
call hybrid threats and improving cyber

114
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:42,370
defenses but when thinking about Savin

115
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,888
deterrence in particular which I

116
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,650
understand as malicious activity in

117
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,030
cyberspace deterring malicious activity

118
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,650
in cyberspace

119
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,570
I would like to mention two important

120
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,900
points to bear in mind before discussing

121
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,080
exactly what actions NATO is taking

122
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,989
first we must determine clearly who and

123
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,960
what we want to deter no international

124
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,990
organization or nation for that matter

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,780
is Agri be able to deter all bad

126
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,060
behavior and not all bad behavior is a

127
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,369
matter of national or international

128
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,460
security instead we must consider what

129
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:22,449
actions we find truly unacceptable and

130
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,060
focus our efforts there second we should

131
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:28,150
try not to fall into a cyber versus

132
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,060
cyber mindset deterring malicious cyber

133
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,489
activity certainly does require action

134
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,830
cyberspace but one of the strengths of

135
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,159
NATO and by NATO mean both the Alliance

136
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,090
and individual allies is their range of

137
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,280
capability

138
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,349
case especially when considering attacks

139
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,130
that might rise to the threshold of an

140
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,660
armed attack the concept of cross-domain

141
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,389
deterrence is an important one to bear

142
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,530
in mind rather than intra-domain or

143
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:59,050
in-kind response or retaliation only so

144
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,780
what is NATO doing to make the potential

145
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,510
cost of a cyberattack too high and make

146
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,500
the potential gains of such an attack

147
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,419
low too low or as low as possible at the

148
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,639
Brussels summit last year allies

149
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:14,590
expressed the determination to employ

150
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,220
the food range of capabilities I'm

151
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,799
quoting including cyber to deter defend

152
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,889
against encounter the full spectrum of

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,830
cyber threats including those conducted

154
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,169
as part of a hybrid campaign they also

155
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,090
resolved and I quote again to continue

156
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,909
to work together to develop measures

157
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,960
which would enable us to impose costs on

158
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,210
those who armed us in February 2019 if

159
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,340
you months ago allies took an important

160
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,620
step in order to systematize and

161
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,630
strengthen their ability to address

162
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,600
significant malicious cyber activities

163
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,000
by agreeing on a guide for strategic

164
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,150
options to respond to them to those

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,460
activities these response options will

166
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,500
have NATO and the Allies to announce

167
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,870
their situational awareness about what

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,940
is happening in cyberspace to boost

169
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,780
their resilience and to work together

170
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:10,860
with partners we must use all the tools

171
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,719
at our disposal political diplomatic

172
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,389
military to be able to tackle the cyber

173
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,039
threats that we face we must also

174
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,979
recognize that the level of malicious

175
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,229
cyber activity below the threshold of

176
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:26,080
armed conflict will remain a continuous

177
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,820
challenge we must make it harder for our

178
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,550
bursaries to inflict damage in

179
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,400
cyberspace and we also must consider how

180
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,219
to impose a price on malicious cyber

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,669
activity a price sufficient to deter

182
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,740
States doing that or style actors must

183
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,958
be presented with strategic dilemmas and

184
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,750
know that they run a credible risk of

185
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:49,540
response ultimately if we do not define

186
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,570
through our action the behaviors that we

187
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,630
will not accept we may end up tacitly

188
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,600
accepting all

189
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,550
behaviors through our inaction and thus

190
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,290
perhaps even contribute to the

191
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,620
continuing escalation of malicious

192
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,939
activity I would emphasize though that

193
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,560
whatever the response NATO will continue

194
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,590
to act in accordance with international

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,079
law recognizing that we all stand to

196
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:16,070
benefit from a knows based predictable

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,020
and secure cyberspace these efforts to

198
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,900
respond to malicious activity are to

199
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,819
however must be built upon a strong

200
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,000
foundation and this foundation is

201
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,700
security resilience this is what the

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,310
terrorist by denial means in this domain

203
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,650
and for NATO and this means for the

204
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,589
Alliance protecting our own networks and

205
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,900
securing our mission cyber is now a

206
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,690
domain of operations alongside land sea

207
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,340
and air as Admiral Nielsen explained

208
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,380
this morning and the cyberspace

209
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,420
operational center is being set up at

210
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,910
our military headquarters in months I

211
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:54,020
would say that is currently closer to 60

212
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:56,709
than 1,000 but allies to need to be more

213
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,329
resilience as we are only as strong

214
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,370
individually and collectively as our

215
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,830
weakest link and one of our key tools

216
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,610
for enhancing our cyber defence and

217
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:10,010
resilience is the cyber defense pledge

218
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,260
adopted in 2016 and the Warsaw summit

219
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,569
allies pledged to strengthen and enhance

220
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,210
the sava defenses of their national

221
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,270
networks and infrastructures as a matter

222
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,070
of priority we have concluded two rounds

223
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,199
of self-assessment our reporting with

224
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,610
the most recent report going to heads of

225
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,410
state and government at the Brussels

226
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,720
summit last year and we are nearly at

227
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,439
the end of the third cycle of the pledge

228
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,970
right now just last week in fact I had

229
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,190
the pleasure to take part in the cyber

230
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,430
defence pledge conference hosted by the

231
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:44,930
United Kingdom in London what I can tell

232
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:48,319
you is that since 2016 almost every ally

233
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:50,300
has upgraded cyber defenses we have also

234
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,980
seen the political impact of the project

235
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,140
there are pledged in several ways the

236
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,210
pledge has attracted a high-level

237
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,060
political attention in allied nations

238
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,640
helped me to continue to elevate cyber

239
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,400
defence from a technical to a strategic

240
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,319
issue it has also been useful in

241
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,130
bringing together a variety of domestic

242
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,350
nationals

243
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,180
stakeholders encouraging and fostering a

244
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,250
whole-of-government approach and whole

245
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,680
of society approached the cyber defense

246
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,660
and it has served as an important

247
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,209
platform for allies to share back

248
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,060
practice last but certainly not least it

249
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:25,130
has helped increasing resources for self

250
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,229
defense both human financial and

251
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,970
technical resource and that is something

252
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,160
that was not a foregone conclusion it

253
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,500
also indicates that political attention

254
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,810
is now focused on that and if I may

255
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,000
allow the side remark of course it has

256
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,589
proved that it has been easier in

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,810
particular for European allies to

258
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:45,680
increase the cyber defense spending than

259
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,869
the fair spending proper throughout NATO

260
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,910
in fact allies are working together

261
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,250
pooling their knowledge and experience

262
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,230
helping each other and with the tangible

263
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,240
multi-player effect across the alliance

264
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,280
and this proves further the point that

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,930
cyber defence is a team sport this

266
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,270
morning you were presented with a

267
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,670
metaphor from basketball being Italian

268
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,400
in Europeana will make one to football

269
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,490
and of course as you probably know the

270
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,040
the unofficial anthem of the Liverpool

271
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,320
Football Club if I may paraphrase it

272
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,939
allies now know that they will never

273
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,650
walk alone so finally to conclude my

274
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,830
introductory remarks I would like to

275
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,449
mention the European Union indeed once

276
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,460
again cyber defense cannot be

277
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,860
accomplished alone and our work with you

278
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,080
provides us with an important partner

279
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,240
for cyber defence issues in addition to

280
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,970
our ongoing work under the framework of

281
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,800
the NATO u joint declaration and the

282
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,930
technical arrangement between desserts

283
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,599
of the two organizations would perhaps

284
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:47,180
mention in particular they use recently

285
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,740
agreed sanctions regime in response to

286
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,989
cyber attack and the president mentioned

287
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,480
that in our introductory speech this

288
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,250
morning just a few weeks ago the council

289
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,470
established a framework that allows the

290
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,900
you to impose targeted restrictive

291
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,240
measures to deter and respond to cyber

292
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,800
attacks which constitute an external

293
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,430
threat to the you and its member states

294
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,870
these are smart sanctions

295
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,000
quintessentially smart sanctions and

296
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,130
they include assets freezes and travel

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,650
bans and is something that could also

298
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,420
help us do imprecise the kind of

299
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,769
deterrence work that we intend to do

300
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,209
with this sort of economic also

301
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,399
response is complimentary and

302
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,410
reinforcing to the actions that NATO is

303
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,809
able to take response to malicious cyber

304
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,389
activity I discussed earlier on about

305
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:32,339
imposing costs on attacks and it is

306
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:34,050
precisely actions like this particularly

307
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,480
when supported by the political and

308
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,059
military tools at the disposal of NATO

309
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,879
the cameras begin to change the behavior

310
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:47,790
of those who would do us harm thank you

311
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:49,980
Thank You Antonio it's perhaps a

312
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,860
provocative question but if I may pick

313
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,470
up on where you mentioned the EU the

314
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,809
sanctions regime and earlier also

315
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,589
deterrence by denial now in one of the

316
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:04,019
earlier panels it was mentioned that

317
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,309
deterrence by denial essentially we can

318
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,649
build a higher wall but there will

319
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:11,790
always be someone who will build an even

320
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:15,290
longer ladder to climb this wall if you

321
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:19,920
take a look at both EU and use and

322
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:23,339
NATO's posture in 2017 the EU came up

323
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,479
with this so-called cyber cyber package

324
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,769
and to my ears it was or to my eyes it

325
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,799
was

326
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:35,490
rephrased or roided as as using NATO's

327
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:40,009
lingo deterrents resilience defence so

328
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:44,999
EU seem to pick up quite a lot of this

329
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:47,699
Natan natal native talk so what's what's

330
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,860
your assessment

331
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:52,349
now that the EU s put on something

332
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,549
tangible on the on the table if you

333
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:59,100
attack us there could be sanctions good

334
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,949
would NATO be ready to follow suits on

335
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,959
anything similar the main difference

336
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,769
between NATO and EU is that NATO is not

337
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:09,329
enormous a setting organization it is a

338
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:11,459
security military alliance and therefore

339
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:14,368
it doesn't have the powers it is not

340
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,138
part of its remit to generate sanctions

341
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:18,360
of that kind it is not within the

342
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,540
portfolio of the Alliance of course

343
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,819
there are certain forms of restrictive

344
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,498
measures that the NATO can apply they

345
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,179
can only be applied and implemented

346
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:30,089
through the Allies and not by the

347
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,619
alliance as such apart from some minor

348
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,059
diplomatic measures such as the

349
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,560
expulsion of diplomats which is

350
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:36,670
something the

351
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:40,459
happen you may remember a few months ago

352
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,990
following the this creeper affair but

353
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,420
normally it is through the Allies that

354
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,100
these measures are implemented of course

355
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,079
there is a general deterrence and

356
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,020
defense posture but the alliance that is

357
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,089
also meant to serve this this purpose

358
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,100
and I would like to add that although

359
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:56,930
the terrorists by panelist is not high

360
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,029
on the agenda of the Alliance of course

361
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,339
there are other instruments also in the

362
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,500
cyber domain that the Alliance could put

363
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,230
to use and one of them is the fact that

364
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,760
nine alized had put other disposals of

365
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,550
shape of a supreme Allied commander

366
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,140
they're what we call sovereign cyber

367
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,959
effects that could be used also for

368
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,730
active cyber operations in this field in

369
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,290
order to protect the mission of the

370
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,540
Alliance and particularly submissions

371
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,699
and operations as they are so this is

372
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,160
part of a broader set of capabilities

373
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,410
that are disposal the Alliance but yet

374
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,900
again the emphasis is on the defensive

375
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:33,050
mission of the Alliance and also on the

376
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,189
fact that we keep a cross domain

377
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,930
approach a full spectrum set of

378
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,990
instruments to to use in order perhaps

379
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,000
also to inflict costs on those who do us

380
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,800
harm

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,010
thank you very much speaking of

382
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,819
individual allies I think it's a good

383
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:55,790
time to move on to Jason Healy word of

384
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,650
advert advertisement he has also written

385
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,689
a article which you can find in the

386
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:04,730
second book but before you do that

387
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:06,949
here's Jason life on stage highlights

388
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,900
thank you live on stage and holding a

389
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,429
laser so I do have laser pointer

390
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,939
dominance thank you if your attention

391
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,380
don't make me use it so I wanted to look

392
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:18,020
at deterrence but also not just

393
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,790
deterrence because the new strategy and

394
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,099
vision of persistent engagement is

395
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,899
really where a lot of the conversation

396
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,119
isn't in Washington DC right now I know

397
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,589
it came up this morning and the two

398
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,540
concepts are really tied and I thought

399
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,310
it would be useful to talk through them

400
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,040
and then maybe in the Q&A get into how

401
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,300
they might apply to NATO and you better

402
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,540
hope that I press the next button and

403
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,190
not slep and press the laser button so

404
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,540
it really has been the precision

405
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,570
engagement is absolutely the biggest

406
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,010
shift that I've seen was my co-editor

407
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,389
Carl Grindle that's here we wrote a

408
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,190
history book on cyber

409
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,930
like and I have to say this is the most

410
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,350
significant thing that we that we have

411
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,480
seen since the very earliest days of

412
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,610
1998 and what the vision is predicated

413
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,100
on of saying the way we normally think

414
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,780
about war in peace its episodic right

415
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,520
you have times of where you have times

416
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,639
of peace you have a ramp up to it and

417
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,610
down afterwards isn't what we face here

418
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,430
or not only we have constant contact

419
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,379
between the adversaries so our ways of

420
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,480
thinking that are based on these

421
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,880
episodes between adversaries won't be

422
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,850
fully accurate and so it's been rooted

423
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,410
in 20 years of conversation on active

424
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,719
defence and deterrence and I think it

425
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,020
melds the two together I won't talk more

426
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,620
about the active defense aspect of it

427
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:35,540
because it's not relevant to this panel

428
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,669
and dude want to point on on deterrence

429
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,770
that reality has moved well past a

430
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,840
theoretical discussion right if you're

431
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,560
in a conversation that says sorry Berta

432
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,399
turns doesn't happen or it's impossible

433
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:52,879
that is just not accurate anymore

434
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,020
reality has moved on I start let me

435
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,550
defend that statement by first saying

436
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,840
Nations four twenty we've been taught

437
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:05,030
the US has been talking about a digital

438
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,730
Pearl Harbor since 1991 so of the twenty

439
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,649
eight years of the seventy eight years

440
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,090
since the actual Pearl Harbor we've been

441
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,640
worried about this large-scale attack

442
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,169
and yet we still have not had

443
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,430
large-scale attacks that have caused

444
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,430
death and destruction

445
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:22,130
especially intentionally and so you're

446
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,480
seeing restraint by states to not cross

447
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,910
that line into the death and destruction

448
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,710
if we were talking about any other kind

449
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,450
of conflict would be calling on calling

450
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,490
that deterrence or at least we'd be

451
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,430
looking at deterrence as part of that

452
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,560
explanation and yet in our field we we

453
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,230
look at where it's failing and what it's

454
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,419
not stopping and declare that it's

455
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,090
impossible or that it's not or that it's

456
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,760
not working also I want to call out here

457
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,250
the US experience in the election

458
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,960
interference of 2016 several of the

459
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,300
participants that were in the Situation

460
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,080
Room discussing how the US should

461
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,710
respond on general clapper said that the

462
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,929
u.s. took options off the table

463
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,850
the

464
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,040
we because the United States was worried

465
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:09,860
about the Russian presence in the US

466
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:12,090
electrical grid then one of Obama's

467
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,040
personally a guy named Ben Rhodes who's

468
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,929
very powerful in the White House said

469
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,280
that the u.s. took options off the table

470
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,780
and responding to the Russians because

471
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,730
we were worried about an escalation path

472
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,010
that will lead to the Russians actually

473
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,850
changing the vote count or attacking the

474
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:30,270
the election more directly talking about

475
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,699
changing an one adversary's decision

476
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,379
calculus because of capabilities or

477
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,180
future operations again that's what we

478
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,360
call deterrence it's just that it it

479
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,030
happened against the US right so we need

480
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,290
to start getting ourselves out of the

481
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,620
theory and looking at the actual

482
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:49,200
practical reality that we're seeing now

483
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,030
I'll point out that the military sees

484
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,290
deterrence and persistent engagement as

485
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,330
quite separate

486
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,460
although complementary deterrence is

487
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,740
useful for some areas but it's not

488
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,820
particularly useful in this DoD view in

489
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,380
this area of constant contact of

490
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,939
persistent engagement that's not

491
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,390
standard within the United States

492
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,670
government and in fact john bolton has

493
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,770
done quite the opposite of saying we're

494
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,480
authorizing offensive cyber operations

495
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,820
to create these frameworks of deterrence

496
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,350
and even saying that OPM is the kind of

497
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,960
threat to privacy that we specifically

498
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,490
are determined to deter and i think i'm

499
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,280
the only one that can actually put up

500
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,920
this slide and get away with it

501
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,930
moustache jokes and so what the DoD and

502
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,620
in the academic and what's really

503
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:36,180
striking out of it is that this this

504
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,679
precision engagement was rooted in

505
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,350
political science and international

506
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,880
ations theory every one of the parents

507
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,510
of the document was a Nash it was in

508
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,340
international relations PhD and so it's

509
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,960
really quite fascinating imagine that in

510
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,550
the nuclear days if the folks that were

511
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,470
writing the strategy that LeMay at

512
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,389
Curtis LeMay or one of the other folks

513
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,190
used had been written by the IR

514
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,080
theorists right instead you had this

515
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,190
huge difference between what IR thought

516
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,350
deterrence was going to be and what

517
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:05,130
Curtis LeMay wanted to fight so I'm

518
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:07,260
sorry about the the the small print here

519
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll walk through it because what DoD

520
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:13,590
hasn't done yet is say well what's the

521
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,390
causation of what they want to do so

522
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,100
and so we've tried to do that in the

523
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,220
slide of one laying out the problem of

524
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,510
the Department of Defense saying

525
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,970
adversaries are acting without restraint

526
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,530
to destabilize the US a road national

527
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,870
sources of power so that's the problem

528
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:31,080
statement the result that the u.s. of

529
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:34,739
the u.s. policy is a stable environment

530
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,870
and continued superiority and I think

531
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,980
this is an interesting thing to ask when

532
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,229
someone is talking to you that they want

533
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,460
deterrence is do you want deterrence

534
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,720
because you want a stable environment or

535
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,760
do you want deterrence because you want

536
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,490
superiority because you might not be

537
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,910
able to get both and right now US policy

538
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:54,030
is to is to achieve both now the method

539
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,740
two through nine is saying that the US

540
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,020
has to defend forward against these

541
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,130
threats that it must do so with reduced

542
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,520
operational constraints that with this

543
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,140
persistent presence in foreign systems

544
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,010
that's yours

545
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,890
that we will be able to intercept and

546
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,460
halt cyber threats enter their networks

547
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:20,430
and learn what they're doing that will

548
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,920
therefore run step five now improve US

549
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,750
defenses because we will learn their

550
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,820
capabilities we will have their tactic

551
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,580
techniques procedures we will have

552
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,010
advanced warning of their intentions of

553
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,139
their attacks and therefore improve US

554
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,480
defenses improving the resilience the

555
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,350
deterrence by denial that got brought up

556
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,080
also we can impose friction if if the

557
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,050
u.s. is disrupting their command control

558
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,460
infrastructure if we are patching our

559
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,889
systems from their vulnerabilities

560
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,600
before we can use them if we are halting

561
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,240
their operations general naka Sony's

562
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,120
word we're imposing friction we're not

563
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,220
deterring them but it is imposing costs

564
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,810
making it harder for them to do what

565
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,430
they want or at least DoD doesn't see

566
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,100
that as deterrent they see it as

567
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:08,850
friction it's more like war fighting

568
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:11,490
interdiction if you will also through

569
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,350
this friction adversaries will have less

570
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,110
capability they're going to be spending

571
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,760
more of their own time on defense having

572
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,800
to defend their networks and rebuild

573
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,280
this disrupted infrastructure therefore

574
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,169
they'll have reduced capability to

575
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,129
continue to attack the United States and

576
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,010
its allies

577
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,600
also some of the in the DoD hasn't said

578
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,910
this as much as some of the theorists

579
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,570
writing that say and therefore this will

580
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,429
lead to a process of tacit bargaining so

581
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:42,580
that we don't decide what the norms are

582
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:45,250
at some table in Geneva or in New York

583
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,889
that we are deciding it by fighting day

584
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:51,549
in day out in the networks and by

585
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,350
getting in there and throwing elbows we

586
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,639
will help decide what's acceptable and

587
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,730
what's not acceptable and that reminds

588
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,740
me of your comments of the impose a

589
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,240
price defining through actions not

590
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,710
inaction and that's really what they're

591
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,750
trying to get at here is this element of

592
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:09,580
tacit bargaining also now a nine is

593
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,820
where the US comes in with a specific

594
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,699
deterrent statement in addition to all

595
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,320
of this getting in and throwing elbows

596
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,630
we want to use offensive cyber

597
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,280
capabilities prep operational prep in

598
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:25,150
the environment to get in adversary

599
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,840
systems to impose a threat so that way

600
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,159
if the rush if Vladimir Putin might want

601
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,070
to do something it's to the US

602
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,020
electrical grid well we are holding his

603
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,320
electrical grid or something else of a

604
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,549
quit that he values equivalently and

605
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,299
therefore these steps two through nine

606
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:44,679
leads leads to the result of ten and so

607
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,710
it's a brilliant again it's an

608
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,450
absolutely fascinating strategy but we

609
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,210
have no idea if it's actually gonna work

610
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,390
that way right it's an experiment and we

611
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,440
have to treat it like an experiment

612
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,990
because it's based on a lot of

613
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,820
assumptions that we just on a fully

614
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,470
understand yet so I think it's

615
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,789
absolutely brilliant I support it but

616
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,360
there's a lot to worry about

617
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:10,120
um so is it likely to work that way let

618
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,639
me just talk about control theory I'm

619
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,979
gonna get academic ewwww so in control

620
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,900
theory what they're basically saying is

621
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,780
that this is going to apply negative

622
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,460
feedback that's the feedback that we're

623
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,530
gonna give is countering the initial

624
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,570
stimulus it's like a like a thermostat

625
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,820
right if it gets too hot it makes it

626
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,950
cooler if it gets too cool it makes it

627
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,370
it makes it hotter that's negative

628
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,110
feedback if there's also a positive

629
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,908
feedback and we and we understand that

630
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,840
right where we're a little bit of

631
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,500
feedback amplifies the initial signal

632
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,539
driving on ice

633
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,630
is like that right you might give a

634
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:49,600
small input to the wheel and might give

635
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:54,309
a wildly erratic output compared to what

636
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,769
you had put in so what we've done in

637
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,908
research at Columbia University is say

638
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:59,500
all right well what are the what's the

639
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,120
full set of feedback loops that we're

640
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,190
looking at here not only the ones that

641
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,750
dude he talked about so we have

642
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,690
something we call on net this is the

643
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,909
more immediate collision results of the

644
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,710
collision between the adversaries and

645
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:14,549
this is in the handout that many of you

646
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,169
got beforehand those that got here early

647
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,539
so we said some of the on net friction

648
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,850
I'm sorry on that feedback includes

649
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:24,460
friction and tacit bargaining that DoD

650
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,689
talked about right if you're hitting the

651
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,100
other or if you're causing friction on

652
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,019
the other side especially if

653
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:33,580
capabilities are expensive or hard to

654
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:37,659
rebuild well then that's going to imply

655
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,820
impose negative feedback if capabilities

656
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:41,500
are inexpensive and easy to replace

657
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,049
then friction is not going to give that

658
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,399
much negative feedback because sure you

659
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:49,029
took down our capabilities but we're

660
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:51,789
able to bring them right back um it for

661
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:52,990
tat it works a little bit the other way

662
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:55,389
I think or at least this is my

663
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,059
assessment if there is a tit-for-tat

664
00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:00,699
dynamic then if something is done unto

665
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,769
you then you want to do back on to them

666
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,450
and in one of our colleagues Stewart

667
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:07,090
Baker in the united states said we

668
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,500
should be proportional plus a little bit

669
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,209
you know give them a little bit extra

670
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,600
right and that's talking about these

671
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:16,750
tit-for-tat dynamics we also have off

672
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,178
net feedback loops which are happening

673
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,970
you know less in the heat of the fight

674
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:23,769
but later on I include deterrents here

675
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,120
um the quote there is from one of the

676
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,710
parents of this document doctor I'm

677
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,928
Emily Goldman

678
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,330
there's also feedback loops of perceived

679
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,740
restraint and adherence to norms you can

680
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,168
call this broken windows theory of

681
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,120
policing right if most everyone else is

682
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:39,009
following the norms and you're most of

683
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,539
the norms most of the time there's a lot

684
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,269
of pressure on you to do so if you feel

685
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:45,519
that everyone else is ignoring the norms

686
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:49,210
then you don't then you feel less less

687
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:51,039
pressure too right now in the US the

688
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,870
sense is that the u.s. is the only one

689
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,700
following the norms there's a motion

690
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,929
cognitive biases

691
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,640
wants to cause fear but what if you

692
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:59,620
cause anger what if you cause a

693
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,480
perceived status challenge I mean also

694
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,300
posture and organizational dynamics if

695
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,300
if creating an offensive posture offense

696
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,990
is the best defense might cause others

697
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,430
to do the same

698
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,530
creating a cyber command might cause

699
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,500
others to do the same if an organization

700
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:16,149
has offensive responsibilities it's

701
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,950
gonna want to conduct offensive

702
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,360
operations that's how it gets budget

703
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,270
that's how you get medals that's how you

704
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,370
get responsibility if every adversary is

705
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,980
doing that then that's going to lead to

706
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,080
this positive feedback so the key

707
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,330
question is well what do we think is

708
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,929
cyber conflict and competition likely to

709
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,820
be more sensitive to the positive

710
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,860
feedback that makes things worse or the

711
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,340
negative feedback that's making things

712
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:46,719
better can we won't get both stability

713
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:48,250
and superiority so um I won't get into

714
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,950
it here but because of reasons a

715
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,930
separate IR Theory called security

716
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,930
dilemma I think there's a lot of

717
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:59,260
evidence that it's more like driving a

718
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:01,360
really bad car with really old tires on

719
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,040
really icy roads and that it lends

720
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,469
itself to the to the negative feedback

721
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,490
but that's my assessment with without a

722
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:11,140
ton of evidence and so on the or without

723
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,190
fully laid out evidence so how are we

724
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,840
gonna know what's working and this is

725
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,360
the paper that's in the I Triple E book

726
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,149
that you got where my co-author Emil

727
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,590
Jenkins and I we we look at we do think

728
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,740
there are some reasonable ways that we

729
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,540
can measure this not just we're shooting

730
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,310
and they're keeping their heads down the

731
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,659
very military metric but I think the

732
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,669
metrics that are very much in line with

733
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,590
what the policymakers are gonna want

734
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,870
what I really want is to make sure that

735
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:38,949
we can that we know we can distinguish

736
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,780
success from failure so that way in five

737
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,310
years if it looks like things have

738
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,149
gotten if things haven't gotten

739
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,850
radically better

740
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,080
we don't have an Afghan situation where

741
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,360
the generals just come in front of the

742
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,939
president say sir we can win this thing

743
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,830
just give us a we just got to defend

744
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,190
forward a little more forward and we can

745
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:00,040
win this that we can be sure that we

746
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,420
know and I won't get onto the I think

747
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,340
I've taken enough time so I won't I

748
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,520
won't go on from there thank you very

749
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,889
much I will pass the laser do you have

750
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,760
sorry yeah

751
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:14,680
thank you Jason a a quick question maybe

752
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,670
a case study but you know in case

753
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:21,190
interesting thing to witness is the

754
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:27,360
relationship between the US and China in

755
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:27,360
cyber so for instance a few years prior

756
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,600
there was a agreement between President

757
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:38,020
Obama and just the presidency on the

758
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:41,530
mutual refrain meant on on attacks for

759
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:45,090
stealing intellectual property or

760
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:47,320
however it was worried so do you think

761
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,730
statements or agreements on the top

762
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:55,120
level that's let's agree not to do harm

763
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:59,950
would these be a tool for the for

764
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:02,620
deterrence to to assure that that was a

765
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,140
deterrence in cyber could work yeah I

766
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,550
would yes but I wouldn't agree to there

767
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,410
were deterrents in that again I think we

768
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,960
tend to use deterrence as a catch-all

769
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:14,050
word for anything meaning restraint or

770
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,540
stability on the other side and and so

771
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,669
absolutely I mean most although

772
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,010
certainly not all observers saw a

773
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:24,220
drastic decrease in chin in Chinese

774
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,680
operations for a period after that no

775
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,050
longer seems to be holding

776
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,290
and so we hadn't agreement and it seemed

777
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:35,169
to have led to a to the right result it

778
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,300
didn't lead to zero but diplomacy rarely

779
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:41,290
is about getting to zero it's usually

780
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:44,320
about better and so and so things were

781
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:46,210
better and if they stopped being better

782
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,860
than I think we can say well what led to

783
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,720
that and how can how can we get there

784
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,879
and in the the article that's in the

785
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,040
book that you all got there there's

786
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,910
quite a bit more on on that case study

787
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:01,030
okay thank you much and no let's move

788
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,400
along to Professor Hollis Duncan the

789
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:06,160
floor is yours thank you let me begin by

790
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,470
thanking seem and the organizers it's a

791
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,200
real pleasure to be back at saikhan

792
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,450
given that all of three panelists have a

793
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,880
background in academia I thought I'd

794
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,940
begin with a famous joke about academics

795
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,410
an engineer a physicist and an economist

796
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,679
are stranded on a desert island with a

797
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,860
sing

798
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,110
a can of food and our engineer cleverly

799
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,678
uses a stick as a lever and a rock as a

800
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,840
fulcrum and and works and nothing can't

801
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,940
get the can't open our physicist does

802
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,490
some math drops the can from a set

803
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,369
height at a certain angle

804
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:41,549
nothing can stays closed our economist

805
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:46,269
steps up and it says I have the solution

806
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:48,639
we should assume a can opener and III

807
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,200
tell the joke because I think the same

808
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:53,289
joke applies to international lawyers

809
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,110
and deterrence most international

810
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:57,549
lawyers assume deterrence we assume

811
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,658
states are deterred from doing whatever

812
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:03,249
the law says states shouldn't do and

813
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:06,029
just as importantly we assume that the

814
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:09,909
only thing that really matters is

815
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,960
deterrence emphasizing that states not

816
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,710
violate the law

817
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,449
I think the rising emphasis on cyber

818
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,760
deterrence opens both of these

819
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:21,129
assumptions to challenge so for example

820
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,649
recent research by Shane EF Ronnie and

821
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:25,210
others suggest that states may not be

822
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:27,730
shaping their behavior to international

823
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,799
law at least not in the law form that

824
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,780
we've seen worked on here for years in

825
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:32,889
the form of the talent manuals and at

826
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,690
the same time I think it's you know

827
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,339
conversations about cyber deterrence are

828
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,280
taking place in political and military

829
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:41,710
terms and not legal ones now in

830
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,940
questioning these assumptions that

831
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,290
international law international lawyers

832
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,280
make about deterrence I don't want to be

833
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,719
seen as suggesting that international

834
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,240
law is irrelevant to the conversation

835
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,908
but you know far from it I actually

836
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,098
think that international law is very

837
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:57,819
relevant to deterrence in at least two

838
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:59,680
possible restrict respects one is that

839
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:02,200
international law could facilitate

840
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,819
deterrence right that that we could have

841
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,859
international law permit effective

842
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:09,099
defensive measures for deterrence by

843
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:11,190
denial or permit or even require certain

844
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:14,890
responsive measures to effectuate

845
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:17,589
deterrence by punishment on the other

846
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,839
hand international law may constrain

847
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:22,779
deterrent activity right prohibiting

848
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,240
certain defensive measures or offensive

849
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,730
module modalities that states might

850
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,529
otherwise want to take now the rationale

851
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,720
for doing so might either be oh we don't

852
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,390
actually want to deter this thing or it

853
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,459
may be that the activity too designed

854
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,420
to achieve deterrence represents some

855
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,270
sort of cure

856
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,190
worse than the disease so what I wanted

857
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,840
to do in my brief remarks to start

858
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,040
things off is explore the relationship

859
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,990
between international law and deterrence

860
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,950
in three respects first I want to

861
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,750
explore a little bit what international

862
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,850
law has to say about the objects of

863
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,500
deterrence the things we want to deter

864
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,540
then I want to examine how international

865
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,030
law regulates the defensive and

866
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,800
responsive responsive measures we might

867
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,560
use to engage in a deterrence strategy

868
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,270
and third I'll propose a little bit more

869
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,700
of a critical take on the legal status

870
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,540
quo right asking if we have the right

871
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,740
regulatory balance between constraining

872
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,320
deterrence in some respects and

873
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,729
facilitating it in others and I'll be

874
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,220
honest at the outset my conclusion is a

875
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,920
modest one unlike in other areas I'm not

876
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,709
ready to say that deterrence requires

877
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,840
new international law but I do believe

878
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,720
we need a research agenda to bring

879
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,640
international law into the conversation

880
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,370
as part of our analysis of deterrence

881
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,299
strategies all right so to begin my

882
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,120
analysis

883
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,680
you know let's reverse the usual

884
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,359
international lawyers approach and

885
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,520
simply which simply says oh what's the

886
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,850
law and then we just expect two turns to

887
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,920
follow

888
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:47,319
let's ask you know what's the behavior

889
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,640
do we want deterred and then let's say

890
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,920
well what does international law tell us

891
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,990
about that that behavior in some way and

892
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,200
if we think along these lines

893
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:58,750
I would group those possible behaviors

894
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,730
that we want to deter into at least five

895
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,520
categories right five labels we might

896
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,590
attach to deterrent behavior that are of

897
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,780
legal significance so one armed attacks

898
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,790
these are at the top of the spectrum the

899
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,880
most grave uses of force this is the

900
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:15,250
object of long-standing focus of NATO

901
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,220
policies even indeed its existence right

902
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,340
then we have uses of force right which

903
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,379
are lesser deployments of armed force

904
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,660
but with violent consequences we have

905
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,130
what international lawyers call

906
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,629
internationally wrongful acts and this

907
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,850
is the term of art for violations of

908
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,250
international law be it of treaties or

909
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:35,020
be it of customary international law

910
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,580
like the duty of non-intervention or

911
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,150
more controversially

912
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:42,220
this idea of sovereignty then we kind of

913
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,780
move beyond the law although I think law

914
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,189
is still relevant here and we could say

915
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,800
oh well we have violations of non

916
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:51,430
legally binding norms think here the the

917
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,380
the 2015 gge consensus report and

918
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,029
finally kind of I would say there are

919
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,100
these what we might call other unwanted

920
00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:00,100
acts right these are acts that are

921
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:02,860
lawful but yet for some reason we still

922
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,930
might want to deter them and we might

923
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,270
want to deter them because they are

924
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,970
regarded as unfriendly in some way like

925
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:13,450
cutting off market access to your ICT

926
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:15,100
products blocking web traffic I put up

927
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,629
here this idea of one-sided deterrence

928
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,339
which i think is what we would say about

929
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,900
espionage right we we want to deter

930
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,360
others from conducting espionage against

931
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,890
us but we want to retain the right to to

932
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,840
engage in that activity and how do we

933
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,940
navigate that and then there's actually

934
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,670
what I call idiosyncratic preferences

935
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,350
where we might want to deter behavior or

936
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,960
state might want to deter behavior that

937
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,700
other states not only like but prefer so

938
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,070
some states might want to deter acts

939
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,870
freedom of expression online because

940
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,830
they see it as in confess inconsistent

941
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:46,359
with their interests and values the

942
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,460
categories are not necessarily exclusive

943
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,830
so most states view armed attacks as

944
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,110
uses of force it's just it's a higher

945
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,690
threshold and more importantly for our

946
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:58,420
purposes I think that they are riddled

947
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,850
with ambiguities and conflicts so let me

948
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,830
flag for that I think are worthy of your

949
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,630
attention the first here I have a small

950
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,770
picture of jean-paul Sartre and he

951
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,050
stands in for what I call the

952
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,330
existential problems with the law right

953
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,190
and that's the idea that some states

954
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,840
dispute the existence of one of those

955
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,040
categories I had just laid out so for

956
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,290
example the United States government

957
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,300
does not see use of force as its own

958
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,070
category and conflates it with armed

959
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,740
attacks there's just a single category

960
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,660
there rather than than two other

961
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,089
problems or what I'd call interpretive

962
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,819
right like debates over what cyber

963
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,530
attacks qualify as a violation of

964
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,630
Article two for which we have been

965
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:37,210
debating since the first icon and I will

966
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,920
say no more on here since I'm sure we've

967
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,470
all heard plenty of that over the years

968
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,510
I think there's the thorny question of

969
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,549
technical and legal attribution right

970
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,800
that because some of those categories I

971
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,960
just listed are dependent on state

972
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,970
behavior or behavior for which a state

973
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,310
can be held responsible and so some of

974
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:56,169
this only works if we know not just what

975
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,110
we're deterring but as the Assistants

976
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:01,300
ago you said who we're trying to deter

977
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,400
and on top of all of this I think

978
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,920
an application problem here we've had

979
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,240
limited public statements by States

980
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,830
about what they think international law

981
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,080
means in cyberspace this morning maybe

982
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,540
being a notable exception and more

983
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,610
pertinently when it comes to looking at

984
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,590
unwanted cyber activity with the sole

985
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,180
perhaps I think the sole exception of

986
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,130
the United Kingdom we've seen a real

987
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,410
reluctance of States to say that

988
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,540
behavior violates international law and

989
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,569
no one to my mind has actually said what

990
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:31,750
international law they think is violated

991
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:33,250
now why should you care right why should

992
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,100
you care about these categories let

993
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,930
alone the the deep legal debates that

994
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,610
they've engendered I think we should

995
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,730
care because from a legal perspective

996
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,560
the the consequences states are legally

997
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,530
required permitted or prohibited from

998
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,720
pursuing are dictated by what category

999
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,180
we put our deterrence object into right

1000
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,339
so there's like a menu of behavioural

1001
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,890
options for effectuating deterrents that

1002
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,600
are key to these categories and the menu

1003
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,819
is longer or shorter depending on what

1004
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,250
category of behavior you place your

1005
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:06,040
object of deterrence in and whether

1006
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:09,220
you're pursuing deterrence by denial or

1007
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,800
deterrence by punishment so like our

1008
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:15,189
menu for deterrence by denial this is

1009
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,460
pretty pretty short you know on the one

1010
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,600
hand some but not all states say there's

1011
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,280
international obligation of due

1012
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,170
diligence right requiring states whose

1013
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,240
territories host some malicious cyber

1014
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:30,400
activity to take feasible measures to

1015
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:33,430
terminate them the 2015 UN Ge Ge report

1016
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,710
has a duty to assist that is not legally

1017
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,870
binding but you know if even though it's

1018
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,000
voluntary if followed the norm could

1019
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:43,600
raise attackers costs as part of a

1020
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,520
deterrence by denial strategy when it

1021
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,470
comes to deterrence by punishment

1022
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,020
I think internationals menu is a bit

1023
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,529
longer it's got five potential

1024
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:55,270
consequences self defense under the UN

1025
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,380
Charter and custom Wright estates enjoy

1026
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,540
right of self-defense when they suffer

1027
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,180
an armed attack that right can be

1028
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,350
exercised collectively and and some

1029
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,720
states would say it can also be

1030
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:06,940
exercised anticipatorily right in

1031
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,740
advance then we have this idea of

1032
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,260
forceful countermeasures that is

1033
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,930
something that is a use of force but not

1034
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,050
an armed attack if you suffer that judge

1035
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,759
Bruno Simha

1036
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,410
judge in the world Court famously stated

1037
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,730
in the oil platforms opinion maybe

1038
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,350
you're entitled to proportionately

1039
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,660
respond with a use-of-force of your own

1040
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,279
that also doesn't cross the armed attack

1041
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,770
threshold although I would note there's

1042
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,210
a categorical existential problem in

1043
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,580
that that that category is not

1044
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,710
universally accepted then there is a

1045
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,150
subject many of us have discussed here

1046
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,210
in the past that's countermeasures right

1047
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,670
that this unlawful activities the

1048
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,640
performance of which is excused because

1049
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,290
of some prior illegality right that you

1050
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,660
know countermeasures are what states to

1051
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:49,610
do impose costs that they would

1052
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,100
otherwise not be able to impose absent

1053
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:54,470
some prior violation of international

1054
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,940
law I think it's important also not to

1055
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,620
forget their treaty based responses

1056
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,810
whether it's the Chart UN Charter or the

1057
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,790
WTO certain treaties say hey if this

1058
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,610
treaty provision is breached the treaty

1059
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,680
itself provides a remedial set of costs

1060
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,790
that might be brought to bear and then

1061
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,740
finally there's this kind of

1062
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,610
all-encompassing category that we call

1063
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,509
rhetoric

1064
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:16,550
and rhetoricians are lawful but

1065
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:19,490
unfriendly acts that you engage in to

1066
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,800
either deny your adversary something or

1067
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:24,109
impose costs so they stop doing

1068
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,120
something you don't like them doing and

1069
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,950
you know that's often been expelling

1070
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,890
diplomats or withdrawing financial

1071
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,960
assistance in cyberspace it might be you

1072
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,029
know blocking websites or making public

1073
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,480
accusations of responsibility for some

1074
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:41,240
cyber operation now the availability of

1075
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,280
each of these operations or each of

1076
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,859
these options turns on which deterrence

1077
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,290
category is implicated right so

1078
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,790
self-defense is only available in an

1079
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,350
armed attack right that's the only one

1080
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,450
you know you got to be in the armed

1081
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,000
attack to be able to use self-defense as

1082
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,109
a responsive option countermeasures you

1083
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,970
can use them when you got an armed

1084
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,130
attack a use of force or an

1085
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,390
internationally wrongful act an acts of

1086
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,680
retorting because they're lawful to

1087
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,299
begin with you can use them anytime you

1088
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,930
want indeed you don't even have to have

1089
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,780
an act

1090
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:11,839
you're responding to to use them and so

1091
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,340
I think by tying States to turn

1092
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,770
strategies to international laws

1093
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,780
categories of behavior the law creates

1094
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,270
both opportunities and obstacles for

1095
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,730
deterrence right so in some cases the

1096
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,230
existing rules facilitate deterrence

1097
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,520
right thank you look with respect to

1098
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,680
armed attacks international law give

1099
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,430
States a lot of rooms to maneuver a lot

1100
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,350
of you

1101
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,319
things on the menu to choose from to

1102
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:35,690
calibrate deterrence either by denial or

1103
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,460
in this case by punishment on the other

1104
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,110
hand the range of options in other cases

1105
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,540
is much more limited where the

1106
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:44,270
underlying conduct is say like the OPM

1107
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:46,340
hack is lawful right you're limited in

1108
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:49,130
your ability to respond to you know

1109
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,750
basically Rhetor ssin as it were and i

1110
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,360
should emphasize that international laws

1111
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:56,300
regulation of deterrence is not limited

1112
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,220
to just this association of category of

1113
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,410
behavior we want to deter response

1114
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:04,490
options international law also regulates

1115
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:07,430
the response options themselves so for

1116
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,140
example even if self-defense is legally

1117
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:11,060
available you must conduct your

1118
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,680
self-defense in a certain way you for

1119
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,350
example you must be proportional in your

1120
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,319
use of self-defense the one I want to

1121
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:20,029
flag just because the list is so long is

1122
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,680
countermeasures right because they have

1123
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,730
an initial peel and I think that we've

1124
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,500
studied them here

1125
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,300
that's icon because of their appeal Oh

1126
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,250
any violation of international law I can

1127
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,110
use countermeasures international law

1128
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,480
actually kind of hit you at the back end

1129
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,160
on countermeasures by imposing a whole

1130
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,770
set of conditions that actually make

1131
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,160
them really hard to apply in practice so

1132
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:42,380
they've got to be proportional they have

1133
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,390
to respond to a prior unlawful act

1134
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,760
so unlike anticipatory self-defence

1135
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:48,620
there's arguably no anticipatory

1136
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,510
countermeasures they have to be

1137
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,370
reversible the point of countermeasures

1138
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,200
is not actually it wasn't they weren't

1139
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,850
designed for come for deterrence they

1140
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,500
were designed for compliance and so once

1141
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,670
the state returns to a state of

1142
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,800
compliance you're supposed to be able to

1143
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:05,030
remove any effects and go back to the

1144
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,620
status quo ante as it were they're not

1145
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,810
supposed to cause third-party harms and

1146
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:11,029
in an environment where we're operating

1147
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:13,910
on privately-owned ICT platforms or

1148
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,920
third state networks you know that's a

1149
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,210
real problem and particularly since the

1150
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,770
UN international law commission

1151
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,240
emphasized that among the things you're

1152
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,740
supposed to respect in doing

1153
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,830
countermeasures is fundamental human

1154
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:27,470
rights that also cabins this deterrent

1155
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:29,029
option here and you know two more I

1156
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,799
think really worth noting as we think

1157
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,060
about countermeasures is one you're

1158
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,650
supposed to tell the state you're

1159
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,210
targeting that you know they did the

1160
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,530
wrong act and you're doing these things

1161
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,690
that you're doing to them

1162
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,920
for purposes of a countermeasure the

1163
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,870
only exception is if it's an urgent

1164
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,160
countermeasure like say Oh

1165
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,330
you don't tell the state that you're

1166
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,470
gonna freeze their bank accounts in

1167
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,029
advance because they take all the money

1168
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,160
out of the bank account so there's an

1169
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,380
exception if the if the countermeasure

1170
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,490
is going to be urgent and the question

1171
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,930
that we international lawyers have been

1172
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,819
wrestling with is does that exception

1173
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,680
swallow the rule or how do we navigate

1174
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,750
this and finally the one that I

1175
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,270
understand I wasn't here for this

1176
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,490
morning's talk is the question of

1177
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,170
certainly the victim is able to engage

1178
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,089
in countermeasures but unlike

1179
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,050
self-defense there's a much larger open

1180
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,750
question about collective

1181
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:13,370
countermeasures whether states can band

1182
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,260
together and engage in countermeasures

1183
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:17,420
collectively I understand that Estonia

1184
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,880
is now putting itself on the on the side

1185
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,380
of the law international law does or

1186
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,320
should allow this and that actually

1187
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,150
ironically stands in contrast to the the

1188
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,340
leanings of some in the Tallinn manual

1189
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,920
international group of experts and

1190
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:36,830
others who regularly attend these sorts

1191
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:38,540
of events now all of this again assumes

1192
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:42,020
that international laws response

1193
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:44,090
measures are widely shared and clear but

1194
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,500
the same existential interpretive and

1195
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,540
application problems I said about the

1196
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,540
categories of cyber behavior also apply

1197
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:53,120
to these response measures so famously

1198
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:55,400
reports suggest that the UN gge in 2016

1199
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,109
and 17 it was China that refused to

1200
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,910
acknowledge a category of self-defense

1201
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,420
and countermeasures with respect to

1202
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:04,819
cyberspace the US has questioned whether

1203
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:08,660
countermeasures must respect fundamental

1204
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:11,870
human rights so kind of in sum I think

1205
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:13,399
despite the under theorization of

1206
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,630
assumption or under theorized

1207
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,850
assumptions of most international

1208
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:19,640
lawyers international law has a lot to

1209
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:21,380
say about what states may want to deter

1210
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,569
and the different vehicles they may use

1211
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,100
to do so and I think if developed and

1212
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,140
deployed carefully acts like for torsion

1213
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,120
and countermeasures could be effective

1214
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,790
in constituting the relevant rules of

1215
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,560
the road and impact an impact reducing

1216
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,779
right reducing the impact of unwanted

1217
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,370
activity at the same time the

1218
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,680
ambiguities and disputes that I have

1219
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:41,600
mentioned could constrain deterrent

1220
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,160
capacities right and that might be bad

1221
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,200
where there's a consensus that we all

1222
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,609
agree we really want to deter X but the

1223
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,609
laws in some ways holding us back

1224
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:51,440
could be good where again we think that

1225
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,210
there are other values like human rights

1226
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,490
that should be served that may take

1227
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,920
priority over our deterrent activities

1228
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:59,538
or reduce the risk of escalation the the

1229
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,160
things that Jay talked about the the

1230
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:03,049
worry that you know what we'll get out

1231
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:07,490
of this deterrent response as a tit for

1232
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:09,710
tat in a worse situation all of which

1233
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,689
takes me to my kind of my final inquiry

1234
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:16,160
which is is the international legal

1235
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:18,650
status quo you know is it a sufficient

1236
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,288
or appropriate constraining and

1237
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,369
facilitating measurement of deterrent

1238
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:24,410
capacity this is international law

1239
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:26,000
working here in a way that we like and

1240
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,250
some I think might be inclined to say

1241
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,349
yeah Jason no no digital pearl harbors

1242
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:35,000
cyber threats are bad and spreading but

1243
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:37,160
you know the costs are largely in

1244
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,109
economic terms we don't have that you

1245
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,420
know what wide-scale examples of

1246
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:44,328
lethality and the like and maybe the

1247
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,740
inability of states to come to consensus

1248
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,900
and how the law applies suggests maybe

1249
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,390
we work more on that then trying to

1250
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,799
already move to changing the law on the

1251
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:53,720
other hand I think there might be

1252
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:55,038
reasonable grounds to say well we might

1253
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,919
want to adjust the law to accommodate

1254
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,240
the realities of deterrence and the need

1255
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,390
to make it effective in cyberspace

1256
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:05,000
so it seems worthwhile to me to take up

1257
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,470
the Estonian suggestion and think hard

1258
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,470
about whether collective countermeasures

1259
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:11,270
should be clarified as within the bounds

1260
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:13,160
of international law you know it's

1261
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,230
curious that the EU cyber sanctions

1262
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,848
there they're laid out but there's no

1263
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,140
legal justification so I don't know

1264
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:21,170
whether those cyber sanctions are

1265
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,879
perceived by the EU adopters as acts of

1266
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,730
return or acts of countermeasures and

1267
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,900
there could be actually some value in

1268
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,240
articulating oh this is or isn't an

1269
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,279
example of a collective countermeasure

1270
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,430
mechanism and I should be clear I don't

1271
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:36,230
necessarily think saying the law itself

1272
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,029
is insufficient is always going to be

1273
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,010
pro deterrence right we might want to

1274
00:50:38,029 --> 00:50:41,809
work on that notification regime if

1275
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,119
you're thinking from a third party or an

1276
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:46,220
ICT company perspective you might really

1277
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:49,400
want to be notified when your networks

1278
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,399
or your technology is the subject or the

1279
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,039
the playing field on which

1280
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,349
countermeasures for example are being

1281
00:50:54,039 --> 00:51:00,680
effectuated and to take up I think Jays

1282
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:02,450
last suggestion there is the third way

1283
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,520
and all international lawyers when asked

1284
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,649
the question love this answer right oh

1285
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,089
it depends right we might conclude we

1286
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:11,239
don't know right we do

1287
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:12,589
have the data to tell us about the role

1288
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,789
international law plays when it comes to

1289
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:16,160
deterrence right we might want more

1290
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:18,469
empirical evidence and I'd note kind of

1291
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,368
in closing despite my opening criticism

1292
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:21,859
of it about international laws

1293
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:24,319
assumptions for deterrence it is worth

1294
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:26,569
asking what deterrent value there is in

1295
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,009
accusing another state of violating

1296
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:30,709
international law in their cyber

1297
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:32,449
operations right two accusations have

1298
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:33,948
more power when they come with the

1299
00:51:32,449 --> 00:51:35,749
weight of international law behind them

1300
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:37,369
a suggestion that you're violating the

1301
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:38,779
UN Charter you're violating this treaty

1302
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:40,069
or this rule this Duty of

1303
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:41,719
non-intervention as opposed to what

1304
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:43,819
we've seen today which is we know it was

1305
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:45,619
you and it was wrong or we we it's

1306
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:47,150
unacceptable without trying to bring law

1307
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:49,759
in and it would be interesting to think

1308
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,650
about other ways to study what

1309
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:53,660
international law work could do here in

1310
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,089
a way that might actually facilitate

1311
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,469
deterrence in some way so I for now I

1312
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:59,538
think international lawyers need to stop

1313
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:02,089
making assumptions about deterrence we

1314
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:04,699
can and should do more to engage across

1315
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:06,410
outside the legal realm with the the

1316
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:07,699
important military and political

1317
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,680
strategic questions

1318
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:12,079
I'm clear-eyed international law is not

1319
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,729
a solve for all wounds but I also don't

1320
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,189
believe it's irrelevant to these

1321
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:17,718
conversations and to my hope that some

1322
00:52:16,189 --> 00:52:19,759
of you may agree and with enough time

1323
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,640
and effort maybe we can figure out a

1324
00:52:19,759 --> 00:52:24,499
little bit more about you know how can

1325
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,549
the rule of law effectuate cyber

1326
00:52:24,499 --> 00:52:27,468
insurance how can it help these

1327
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:30,199
strategies at the same time

1328
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:32,630
how can cyber deterrence comport with

1329
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:35,359
the rule of law that is so fundamental

1330
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,739
to the the modern international

1331
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,799
community of states with that I'll stop

1332
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:41,660
and look forward to the conversation

1333
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:44,719
great thank you very much Duncan a quick

1334
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:48,259
question to you before we move move on

1335
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:51,849
to the questions phase as I mentioned

1336
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:56,319
you are an expert working with the

1337
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:58,819
Organization of American States and I

1338
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,920
would say it's you know it's global

1339
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:02,479
phenomenon that there is no globally

1340
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,670
shared consensus when it comes to

1341
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:07,848
international law in regarding

1342
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:11,209
cyberspace given this is a transatlantic

1343
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:14,749
conference and a transatlantic forum for

1344
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:17,299
discussions what's your assessment is

1345
00:53:14,749 --> 00:53:18,799
there any kind of consensus perhaps

1346
00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:21,660
emerging in the Western Hemisphere if

1347
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:25,079
you if you could generalize

1348
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:28,680
sure I've already used it depends once

1349
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:31,049
so I opted to use it again but so I'm

1350
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,460
and when I'm not a professor among other

1351
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:33,900
things I do is I'm on this thing called

1352
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,160
the OAS juridical committee those even

1353
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,359
know the internet UN international law

1354
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,970
Commission this is the regional

1355
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:41,670
equivalent in the OAS and and one of the

1356
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:44,368
things that we've done looking ahead to

1357
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,380
the UN group of government experts is I

1358
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:47,339
we've had a lot of forward progress over

1359
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,750
the years about international law

1360
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:50,069
applies in cyberspace and we're now at

1361
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,809
the question of how does it apply and

1362
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:53,308
the UN group of government experts will

1363
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:55,769
be taking up that question but it

1364
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:58,109
occurred to us in the OAS that we don't

1365
00:53:55,769 --> 00:54:01,558
necessary have to wait for the gge to

1366
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:03,480
get there a first step is not to

1367
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,680
necessarily stay you know come out with

1368
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,140
any broad statements about what the law

1369
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,848
says but to get more transparency from

1370
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,379
states as to what they think the rules

1371
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:12,390
are so that we can answer your question

1372
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,160
which is where do we have consensus and

1373
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,538
where do we have divergence so one of

1374
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,529
the things the juridical committee has

1375
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:18,509
done is we put out a formal

1376
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:20,369
questionnaire so the 34 member states

1377
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:23,519
and said you know here are a series of

1378
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:24,000
questions where you know if if and it's

1379
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,709
voluntary

1380
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,119
nobody's required to answer but if you'd

1381
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,170
like to tell us do you think sovereignty

1382
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,089
is a rule or do you think it's a

1383
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,859
principle you know this would be an

1384
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:35,339
opportunity to do so and the OAS is not

1385
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:37,259
planning at all in like regional thought

1386
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:39,690
it this is just to collect the views of

1387
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:41,640
states to communicate and to feed into

1388
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,700
broader whether it's transatlantic or

1389
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,049
global processes I don't pretend that

1390
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,308
it's gonna make a tremendous

1391
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,950
contribution but I think it would make a

1392
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:52,259
contribution the more states are able as

1393
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:54,750
they become informed to express not just

1394
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:56,039
their strategies in cyberspace but how

1395
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,089
they understand you know what their

1396
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:58,769
lawyers are telling them behind the

1397
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:59,970
scene how they understand both the way

1398
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:01,828
law is helping them and the law is

1399
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:04,078
constraining them the more we know that

1400
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:08,460
the more we can map areas where we need

1401
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:10,019
to work great thank you and ladies and

1402
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,089
gentlemen and we're well on time so

1403
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:15,109
please prepare your questions and to

1404
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:17,578
start off with a Q&A session of I will

1405
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:19,650
first have a question to all the

1406
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:23,849
panelists or actually I have three here

1407
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:25,380
three questions to three panelists and

1408
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:27,119
the questions are the following so in

1409
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,430
your opinion is the overall idea of

1410
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,369
cyber deterrence is it succeeding or

1411
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:35,430
failing we discussed this especially

1412
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:38,279
during your presentation Jason batts

1413
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:41,430
of course I would invite all of you to

1414
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:42,900
to give your comments

1415
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,009
the second question from your

1416
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,499
perspective as we have an

1417
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:49,319
interdisciplinary approach and and

1418
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:52,019
backgrounds here on this panel do you

1419
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:55,109
think that international law with a with

1420
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:57,499
the status status quo as as introduced

1421
00:55:55,109 --> 00:56:01,380
by Duncan is it supporting in the States

1422
00:55:57,499 --> 00:56:05,669
in their quest for ensuring cyber

1423
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:07,920
deterrence and last but not least a

1424
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:10,049
question on on NATO so we've seen that

1425
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,920
some of the bigger allies notably the US

1426
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:16,200
or France in recent times they have come

1427
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,039
up with a more proactive approach

1428
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,930
so speaking of contre measures offensive

1429
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:28,559
capabilities is no longer a two-book a

1430
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:33,509
taboo so in your opinion if some of the

1431
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:35,490
allies are pushing our heads how how's

1432
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:38,400
the situation with the others is NATO as

1433
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:41,578
an alliance is it timely for them to

1434
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,930
quit for NATO to consider moving on as

1435
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:48,420
alliance also to a more proactive

1436
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:51,269
posture or is NATO better off with with

1437
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:55,460
a status as it is right now so in your

1438
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:59,910
in your opinions please consider those

1439
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:02,099
different questions and and reminder to

1440
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:11,430
the audience that we will open your Q&A

1441
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:13,670
enemies but who wants to go first quick

1442
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:16,759
remarks on all three questions although

1443
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:19,220
on this panel I'm the one who is least

1444
00:57:16,759 --> 00:57:21,900
competent on international law

1445
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,848
succeeding or failing I mean it's a

1446
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,670
difficult call first of all because this

1447
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:28,200
is uncharted territory the terrans in

1448
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:30,450
cyberspace is not comparable to

1449
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,538
deterrence in other fields such as the

1450
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,489
nuclear domain where the main indicator

1451
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:36,749
of success or failure of the terrorists

1452
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:38,220
is whether something happened and

1453
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:40,049
nothing has happened so in this respect

1454
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,788
deterrence in the nuclear domain has

1455
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:43,349
been a big success or in this case of

1456
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:46,330
course it's much more difficult to

1457
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:48,790
measure the impact of the

1458
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:51,730
and there could be cases of successful

1459
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:54,040
the terrorists cannot be claimed because

1460
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:56,890
this is an era in which many many things

1461
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,960
happen below the other screen and sort

1462
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:01,810
of gray area it is very difficult for

1463
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,450
individual states to claim success in

1464
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:07,779
the turns because that would mean

1465
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:09,490
unveiling threats and those tile

1466
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,100
operations that could also have a

1467
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:14,350
negative effect on the wider public in

1468
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:17,799
that particular respect and I would say

1469
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:21,250
that we also lack the possibility of

1470
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,410
doing counterfactuals if we do something

1471
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:26,110
we can see more or less what happens

1472
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:27,910
after that action but we cannot do the

1473
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,580
same experiment with a different kind of

1474
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:33,839
action attribution is a can in point I

1475
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:38,560
mean it is a highly contested issue

1476
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:41,050
politically and so digitally it is very

1477
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:44,259
difficult at a stage to say that

1478
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:47,140
attribution per se public or not is

1479
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:49,000
working there is a mixed record so far

1480
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,920
in this particular respect and I think

1481
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,540
it is a fast evolving situation and I

1482
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,790
think it is a case of trial and error

1483
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:56,710
and to see exactly what works and what

1484
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:59,080
may not work and it will take time to

1485
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:01,420
have a sufficient assessment of that

1486
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,310
whether international law works it again

1487
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,100
independent little bit on what you are

1488
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:08,259
looking at I think that most of the your

1489
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:11,140
style and malicious activities that we

1490
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:14,070
see and we are very often the target of

1491
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:16,810
our intelligence operations and

1492
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:19,870
intelligence operation are not subject

1493
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:22,390
or addressed by international law and

1494
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:23,890
therefore of course the the boundary

1495
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:25,359
between what is an intelligence

1496
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,759
operation intelligence gathering

1497
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,100
basically and a moral style activity

1498
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,470
that could lead to sabotage exploitation

1499
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,210
and so forth is very often a very fuzzy

1500
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:36,640
boundary and it is very difficult to

1501
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,890
establish in advance when the second

1502
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,600
part of the equation could lead to the

1503
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:41,799
application of international law so I

1504
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:45,069
think that we are confronted with

1505
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:47,170
challenges that are factual challenges

1506
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:50,230
that are very difficult to answer to

1507
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:51,910
whether with a clear yes or no on NATO

1508
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,800
clearly this is a domain in which

1509
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:56,350
national doctrines are evolving very

1510
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,060
very fast under the pressure of events

1511
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:59,520
and development I would say that when I

1512
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,080
am in this job I

1513
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,300
the stuff for one year and a half and

1514
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,460
already over this period of roughly 18

1515
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,670
months I have seen national doctrines of

1516
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:10,980
big and small nations evolve very very

1517
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:13,110
fast and it is extremely interesting to

1518
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,560
see around the table in committees at

1519
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:18,570
the Alliance the steps forward in many

1520
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,370
many cases that are being made by a

1521
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:22,590
different way they go sometimes even

1522
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:24,450
against the expectations that one would

1523
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:26,670
therefore the conduct and the priorities

1524
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:28,470
of individuals say certainly there is a

1525
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,920
realization that more has to be done

1526
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:34,169
certainly cyber related threats are in

1527
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,270
the rudder screen of a decision makers

1528
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:38,910
now including at the national top

1529
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,470
political national level I think we have

1530
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,940
seen over the past couple of years also

1531
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,529
threats to the integrity of our

1532
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,170
democratic institutions and processes

1533
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:47,250
and this is something that hits put this

1534
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:49,380
issue makes they do realize that

1535
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:52,590
something has to be to be done to this

1536
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:56,820
effect it is still I think very early to

1537
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:59,160
tell where this could lead and I mean I

1538
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:01,790
can testify myself that sometimes there

1539
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,649
are three steps ahead and one step

1540
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,660
behind the taken at the multilateral

1541
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:09,930
level but is extremely interesting to

1542
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:12,240
see that now there is awareness or the

1543
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:14,279
issue until a few years ago until even a

1544
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,250
few months ago this was still restricted

1545
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,960
to a very limited and narrow team of

1546
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:21,270
experts in this field now there is

1547
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,400
widespread awareness that this this

1548
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:28,230
matters this is the new normal and then

1549
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,880
we have to deal with it and I love that

1550
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,320
last point that was gonna be my what I

1551
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:35,250
was gonna say on NATO right it was

1552
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,440
easier to imagine NATO it was easy to

1553
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,960
see NATO as helpless when the leadership

1554
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,270
seemed mystified on cyber when the

1555
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,370
members of the neck were I don't

1556
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:47,009
understand this I can't program my VCR

1557
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:48,870
it wasn't quite that bad but it was and

1558
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:50,970
now seeing the exercise I see more

1559
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:52,799
confidence in the neck seeing the the

1560
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,290
statement seeing the policy statements

1561
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,730
the exercises and and I don't know if

1562
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:59,430
anyone's deterred by that but it's

1563
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:01,110
certainly confidence-inspiring for the

1564
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:03,480
defenders and those of us that are

1565
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:05,520
looking to nato and and hopefully if

1566
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,340
it's inspiring confidence in us it's

1567
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,440
it's having an opposite impact on on the

1568
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,580
other side so I've really been thrilled

1569
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,860
at that

1570
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:18,790
I've always been hoping that NATO might

1571
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:23,080
do an article for consultation on

1572
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:24,490
election interference and still have my

1573
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:28,180
fingers cross because I think that would

1574
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:31,120
be a very useful application of article

1575
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:32,529
4 on law supporting states it's a great

1576
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,819
questions you know it's a core you know

1577
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:37,510
I'm not an international relations

1578
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:39,490
theorist by by academic training and so

1579
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,870
it's very very interesting to sit in in

1580
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,060
this great international relations

1581
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:47,049
school because it's a classic question

1582
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:49,930
for my I are colleagues of what

1583
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:52,780
restrains states if states aren't doing

1584
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:55,180
things then then what are the causal

1585
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:57,100
explanations for why they for why

1586
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:59,350
they're they're choosing restraint and

1587
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,330
that might be international law is one

1588
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:03,700
of those it might be they're deterred it

1589
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,080
might be self-interest Joe and I likes

1590
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,580
to talk about entanglement if we do

1591
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,799
something to you it's kind of about it's

1592
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:11,920
going to bounce back on us and I think

1593
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:15,370
too often we've just been focused on one

1594
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,410
of those one of those aspects if you're

1595
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:18,520
military you tend to look at deterrence

1596
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,870
if you're in Tallinn you tend to talk

1597
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,960
about international law that's what we

1598
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:26,259
do here um but my my are colleagues also

1599
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:29,770
talk about order right what what meant

1600
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:34,750
what made the Congress of Vienna so

1601
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:37,300
lasting and it wasn't a time of peace it

1602
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:38,890
was a time of relative peace and it

1603
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,750
wasn't about law it was it was largely

1604
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,250
about order of then of the nations of

1605
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,690
Europe saying alright we bet you know

1606
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,940
we've been through something bad let's

1607
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:49,060
make sure that we're we're managing the

1608
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:50,590
situation and so I do want us to think

1609
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,180
about what are these other ways what

1610
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,860
does order look like if you're in order

1611
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:57,220
you might have to give things up in

1612
01:03:53,860 --> 01:04:00,250
order to gain something larger what what

1613
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:02,830
does that look like and on the I mean

1614
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,660
it's true on the as journals had said

1615
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,549
you can't prove deterrence is working

1616
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:09,069
but leaves nuclear deterrence we know it

1617
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:12,610
didn't fail right we didn't have any

1618
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:15,580
mushroom clouds and failure for cyber

1619
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:18,430
deterrence I think is also louder than

1620
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:19,920
success you can't measure its succeeding

1621
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:23,620
but you can measure if it's failing in

1622
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,539
large-scale attacks for example and what

1623
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,729
we did in the article was

1624
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:28,839
said you know it's gonna be incredibly

1625
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:31,928
difficult to ever get to actual

1626
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:33,578
causation that state aid did this or

1627
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:34,959
didn't do that and the result was this

1628
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:39,869
it's just gonna be incredibly difficult

1629
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:41,888
but you can at least do some simplest

1630
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:44,529
correlation it struck me I was listening

1631
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:46,809
to the radio one time and and the the

1632
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:48,849
nuclear physicists were saying you know

1633
01:04:46,809 --> 01:04:51,789
we're doing these colliders these

1634
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:54,909
particle colliders and we're starting to

1635
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:58,779
get so much energy in into these into

1636
01:04:54,909 --> 01:05:00,069
these collisions that some of the

1637
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:02,889
theories are looking less and less

1638
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:04,449
likely the explanatory power of these

1639
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:06,130
theories is starting to disappear

1640
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:09,519
because we would have seen evidence for

1641
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:12,399
them by now so all right let's say if

1642
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,839
the the argument of general NACA so near

1643
01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:16,779
john bolton that this is gonna make

1644
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:19,419
things better let's just imagine if in

1645
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:22,539
future we look at large-scale disruptive

1646
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:24,098
attacks as a category of a policymakers

1647
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:26,859
category a policy wants to see a

1648
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:28,779
reduction and we do see a reduction well

1649
01:05:26,859 --> 01:05:30,130
that's what the hawk said was going to

1650
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:33,339
happen it doesn't prove it

1651
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:37,659
but at least it is it is in compliance

1652
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:42,189
with the theory if we say a dramatic

1653
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:44,589
increase after the policy is enacted and

1654
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:47,288
we take actions to pursue persistent

1655
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:49,929
engagement it is not compliant with the

1656
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:51,459
theory it's not saying it's wrong it's

1657
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:53,139
just saying that those people that said

1658
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:55,689
it was going to make things way better

1659
01:05:53,139 --> 01:05:57,009
if we started to impose costs directly

1660
01:05:55,689 --> 01:05:59,848
on the network through forward defense

1661
01:05:57,009 --> 01:06:02,619
they've got a lot more explaining to do

1662
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:04,630
because a simple read of the evidence is

1663
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:07,449
saying it doesn't it's not working out

1664
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:09,789
that way it's not saying they're wrong

1665
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:12,609
it's not getting to causation it's

1666
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:14,589
barely correlation it's saying they've

1667
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:15,819
got more explaining to do than the folks

1668
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,538
that are saying it's gonna it's gonna

1669
01:06:15,819 --> 01:06:18,880
make things worse

1670
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:24,339
because it is come in compliance with

1671
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:25,659
that argument so you know I'd add on

1672
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:28,689
those three questions I think with

1673
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:30,969
respect to international law I you may

1674
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:32,319
have noticed I deftly I said the

1675
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:33,880
question is what is it that we want to

1676
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,249
deter and then use broad international

1677
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,619
law categories and and and didn't

1678
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:40,928
actually associate some of the activity

1679
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:41,979
in cyberspace we want to deter and I

1680
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:43,929
think you know I did I did that on

1681
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:46,448
purpose because I think you know

1682
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:50,349
ultimately that's been the challenge is

1683
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:53,159
getting States to articulate at a level

1684
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:55,869
of precision what they think they're

1685
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:58,479
defending against and what they are

1686
01:06:55,869 --> 01:07:00,759
going to punish for behavior and I think

1687
01:06:58,479 --> 01:07:02,468
there's clarity at the top end and so

1688
01:07:00,759 --> 01:07:04,299
you know again the digital no digital

1689
01:07:02,469 --> 01:07:05,499
pearl harbor' I think is a value and it

1690
01:07:04,299 --> 01:07:07,449
may not demonstrate the success of

1691
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:09,279
deterrence but the absence of failure is

1692
01:07:07,449 --> 01:07:11,079
useful although you know certain events

1693
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:14,499
in Ukraine do beg the question of

1694
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:16,269
precisely how successful that is I think

1695
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:17,649
one of the things we found and this was

1696
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:20,019
of course the challenge with tally

1697
01:07:17,649 --> 01:07:21,909
Manuel 2.0 is that once we move before

1698
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:22,868
the use below the use of for special

1699
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:25,539
international lawyers we've actually

1700
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:28,029
spent a lot less time on general

1701
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:29,799
customary rules in this space because

1702
01:07:28,029 --> 01:07:32,079
most international lawyers specialize in

1703
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:33,969
the environment or human rights or trade

1704
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,549
and the like and so what we found was

1705
01:07:33,969 --> 01:07:38,169
there's a lot of the difficulty of

1706
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:39,609
measuring the success or failure ends up

1707
01:07:38,169 --> 01:07:41,529
being the difficulty of we're not sure

1708
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:43,149
what box to put things in to then ask

1709
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:44,979
the question of whether it's being

1710
01:07:43,149 --> 01:07:47,739
deterred or not and so you know one of

1711
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:49,359
the challenges has been you know we're

1712
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:51,429
trying to deter election interference

1713
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:53,259
and where does that fit in this

1714
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:54,789
framework is that a violation of a

1715
01:07:53,259 --> 01:07:56,109
political norm or does that fit as an

1716
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:58,989
internationally wrongful act and if so

1717
01:07:56,109 --> 01:08:02,380
which one intellectual property theft by

1718
01:07:58,989 --> 01:08:05,229
espionage is that more like espionage

1719
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:06,729
that as we've heard as traditionally if

1720
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:08,468
not outside of international law

1721
01:08:06,729 --> 01:08:10,629
international law looks the other way or

1722
01:08:08,469 --> 01:08:11,919
is it somehow something you know about

1723
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:14,979
trade and intellectual property services

1724
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:16,689
and subject to it so I think that's been

1725
01:08:14,979 --> 01:08:18,939
kind of the challenge in measuring

1726
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:21,219
success or failure and again I'll harken

1727
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:22,238
back most international lawyers you you

1728
01:08:21,219 --> 01:08:23,460
say to them well what do you think about

1729
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:25,299
deterrence international law and

1730
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,710
apologies to those of you who have

1731
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:29,019
thought about this but most of us

1732
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:30,788
haven't most of us will tell you what we

1733
01:08:29,019 --> 01:08:32,529
think the international law is where we

1734
01:08:30,788 --> 01:08:34,479
think there's ambiguities or give you an

1735
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:36,190
it depends answer and we haven't tried

1736
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,568
to associate it with the with the goals

1737
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:38,379
because for most international lawyers

1738
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:41,429
the goal is to advance

1739
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:44,400
law not advance some deterrence strategy

1740
01:08:41,429 --> 01:08:47,049
you know in terms of the overall

1741
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:49,808
cyber deterrence succeeding or failing a

1742
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:51,670
one thing I'd add to this is to harken

1743
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:54,520
back to the to the who

1744
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:56,890
I mean we also shouldn't you know you

1745
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,210
know unify who were we're trying to

1746
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:59,920
deter you know obviously I think

1747
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:02,529
deterrence is much harder with rogue

1748
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,270
actors and there are several of whom you

1749
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:06,609
know that there's a real open question

1750
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,440
of what could you possibly do that will

1751
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:10,479
deter below the use-of-force threshold

1752
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:13,629
right I think the you know I do think it

1753
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:15,219
breaks out that way but let's not also

1754
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:17,140
forget that these deterrent activities

1755
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:20,170
have a constructive value in that they

1756
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:21,940
also plan a flag and rally whether it's

1757
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:24,550
NATO or whether it's a broader community

1758
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:26,439
of like-minded states around you know

1759
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:28,450
certain norms because again the things

1760
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:29,830
we're trying to get States not to do or

1761
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:32,319
the things we want States to do

1762
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:35,140
defensively you know even if you're not

1763
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:38,080
piercing the four or five six rogue

1764
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:40,780
actors you are solidifying a community

1765
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:43,390
and that may actually both improve

1766
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:45,910
defenses overall and if you can act

1767
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:47,860
collectively provide a better basis for

1768
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:49,210
imposing costs and so I do think that

1769
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:51,189
that's one of the questions I have on

1770
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:52,779
the going forward is whether or not we

1771
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,950
need to think more about can we get

1772
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:55,120
international law to a collective

1773
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,679
countermeasure stage or what are the

1774
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,750
risks of collective countermeasures that

1775
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:02,320
might say we're not ready for it yet

1776
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:05,140
and you know I think with NATO I liked

1777
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,120
the behind versus a you know caught up

1778
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,740
if not ahead I tend to agree that you

1779
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,930
know it and think about how much how far

1780
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:15,130
NATO's come in in twelve years on this

1781
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:17,680
and I think the question I'd ask is what

1782
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:20,260
NATO could be doing beyond policy in

1783
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,210
terms of actual operations and so like

1784
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:24,820
to me tying this with the collective

1785
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:26,530
question is you know what value or what

1786
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,330
risks would there be to escalation of

1787
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:30,160
NATO making collective a collective

1788
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,140
accusation of a cyber operation coming

1789
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,190
from NATO as opposed to an ad hoc

1790
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,500
collection of states

1791
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:37,960
I mean we've begun to see states saying

1792
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,970
there's more value if instead of one of

1793
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,820
us saying we know X you did this and it

1794
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:45,010
was wrong suddenly states saying we all

1795
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:46,420
know this because you get less blowback

1796
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:47,890
on what's your technical indicators are

1797
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:50,260
compromised if you can actually get

1798
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:51,280
multiple states and I don't know that

1799
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,780
NATO should do it I mean there's

1800
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,630
definitely because that because that

1801
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:58,059
puts it in a military lens it might risk

1802
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:59,530
it might risk escalation or putting us

1803
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,940
you know a state and a mindset where

1804
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,830
they'd move to escalation rather than

1805
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:04,290
retreat but it's a question I think

1806
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:08,700
worth asking

1807
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:10,170
all right great like Japan and no ladies

1808
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:13,440
and gentlemen let's move to the Q&A

1809
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:15,300
phase please state your name and IP

1810
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,360
address in case we need to follow back

1811
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,460
on you and one of our good volunteers

1812
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,900
already several of them in the hall they

1813
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,120
will hand you the mic so please raise

1814
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:28,379
our armed represent yourself and ask a

1815
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:30,450
question yeah gentlemen yeah

1816
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,070
I'll stand up so I can see you thank you

1817
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,420
my name is Nicolas OTT I work for the

1818
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,099
OIC the Organization for Security

1819
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:38,790
Cooperation Europe I have a question for

1820
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:43,650
you Jay your comments on the Terrence

1821
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:45,600
and persistent persistent engagement got

1822
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:49,440
me thinking what else is out there what

1823
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,200
kind of concepts beside persistent

1824
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:55,469
engagement are worth looking into so if

1825
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:58,170
I handed you a card saying cyber

1826
01:11:55,470 --> 01:12:01,380
deterrence and blank what would be the

1827
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:03,270
concept that is that should be maybe

1828
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,610
compared to persistent engagement as a

1829
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:07,680
way to make cyber deterrence more

1830
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:08,880
effective well you know I wouldn't

1831
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,680
necessarily make cyber defense

1832
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,540
deterrence more effective because that's

1833
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,520
to me that's just absolutely loaded

1834
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:16,920
right I mean in in international a

1835
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,470
sincerity in in international ation is

1836
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:23,010
deterrence as a theory it's a causal

1837
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:25,230
theory that says to get peace you need

1838
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,670
capability and the other side has to

1839
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:29,009
understand your willingness to use it

1840
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,390
it's a theory that if you do that it's

1841
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:33,060
going to lead to peace there's a

1842
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:35,820
competing theory of security dilemma

1843
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:38,460
that says if you get capability to have

1844
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:40,080
the willingness to use it everyone else

1845
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,270
is going to see you have that they're

1846
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,160
not going to understand if you are what

1847
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:46,020
your intentions are and so therefore

1848
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,030
they have to have capability and the

1849
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:51,180
willingness to use it and therefore you

1850
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:53,340
end up in an escalation we don't yet

1851
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:55,470
know which of those theories is

1852
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:57,510
applicable here I see way more on the

1853
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:59,160
security dilemma side when my colleagues

1854
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:03,150
at Columbia said I'm a guy named Bob

1855
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:05,099
Jervis said in 1978 a security to him is

1856
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:06,239
doubly danger if its offense dominant

1857
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,760
and you can't distinguish offense from

1858
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,989
defense because then if you can't

1859
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,370
distinguish offense from defense and if

1860
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:13,110
I gain weapons you don't know if I

1861
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:15,690
intend them to attack you or defend

1862
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:17,509
myself if it's offense dominant then it

1863
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:19,790
gives a lot of advantage to attacking

1864
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:21,020
first kind of sounds like our field

1865
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:23,900
right those are the things that we say

1866
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:25,820
about cyber conflict so I think there's

1867
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,830
a lot of dynamics of the security

1868
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:29,120
dilemma here and we can't just

1869
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:30,110
distinguish offense from defense we

1870
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,300
can't distinguish offense defense

1871
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:35,509
espionage operational preparation in the

1872
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,220
environment and the rest so I not even

1873
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:40,490
to use the word deterrence most of the

1874
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:42,050
time I want stability right we haven't

1875
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:44,780
crossed that line particularly into

1876
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:47,420
death and destruction yet I want to

1877
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:48,620
throw as much concrete and rebar into

1878
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,900
that line to make sure that we're not

1879
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:52,610
going across it so I'm much more

1880
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:56,089
concerned about stability than I am

1881
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:58,400
about deterrence I really if I can pull

1882
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:00,920
it all the way out I want sustainability

1883
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,650
and to me that is the root of any time

1884
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:05,720
I'm looking at a cyber policy question

1885
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:08,120
including espionage and if espionage is

1886
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,490
okay or how much espionage enough when

1887
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:12,590
our kids and grandkids are our age are

1888
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:15,559
they gonna have an Internet but at least

1889
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:18,620
as free secure open resilient as awesome

1890
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,390
as the one that we have today that to me

1891
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:24,200
is the question and if the church is

1892
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:26,090
gonna help us get there great but to me

1893
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,400
that's what we need that's what we ought

1894
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:29,930
to be aiming for out of this because if

1895
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,679
we're not getting that then what the

1896
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,800
hell are we doing

1897
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:35,630
um and if and if everybody's peeing in

1898
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,070
the pool and and some countries are

1899
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,990
bragging about how big their bladder is

1900
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:39,710
right and because they're thinking

1901
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,929
that's going to lead to a better

1902
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:43,580
situation right so I really want us to

1903
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,050
get out of the military mindset in this

1904
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:49,010
and start looking at sustainability and

1905
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:54,460
in most cases okay thanks Nick next

1906
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:54,460
question maybe in the second row

1907
01:14:56,510 --> 01:15:00,380
cadet aja murray from united states

1908
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:02,390
military academy my question is do you

1909
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:04,370
regard tacit bargaining as fostering an

1910
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:06,410
environment that increases potential

1911
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:09,200
threats over time due to unclear or a

1912
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:13,870
fuzzy borders of what is acceptable and

1913
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:17,540
unacceptable in cyberspace thank you hmm

1914
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:19,250
do to me the I think thanks could at the

1915
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:23,450
you know the argument of tacit

1916
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:25,400
bargaining has a lot of it's a great

1917
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:26,750
concept and you know they took it right

1918
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,790
out of shelling one of the classic

1919
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:30,590
international agents theorists but in

1920
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:32,030
the nuclear age you had

1921
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,950
or in regular warfare you've got a lot

1922
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:37,070
of ways that you can communicate to the

1923
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:39,110
other side about what is acceptable or

1924
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:42,110
what is not acceptable right we can we

1925
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:46,040
can send b-52s flying between the Taiwan

1926
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:47,240
Strait we can fly b-52s over South Korea

1927
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,670
sorry I'm gonna keep using Air Force

1928
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,590
examples insert some some army example

1929
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,900
if you want right we can send some Navy

1930
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:56,720
ships off we've got all sorts of ways to

1931
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:58,519
signal in regular conflict that things

1932
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,710
are they're getting too they're getting

1933
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,880
too far right move move the tanks to the

1934
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:05,780
border there you go

1935
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:09,290
move the tanks to the border and we we

1936
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:11,809
don't have most of those in cyber

1937
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:14,000
conflicts for our bargaining almost all

1938
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:15,860
of the bargaining is going to happen

1939
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,870
between the military and espionage

1940
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,429
forces themselves in close contact with

1941
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:21,890
the enemy we don't particularly have

1942
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:24,800
hotlines we don't have any good way

1943
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:26,120
where it's classified on each side and

1944
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,580
we're not even confessing that we're

1945
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,260
that we're doing this activity so all of

1946
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:33,140
the theory of communication that tacit

1947
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:35,260
bargaining would normally rely on so

1948
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:37,640
that you can tap out for the other side

1949
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,910
to say okay enough is enough I'll back

1950
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,190
off

1951
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:42,290
we don't have tacit bargaining works

1952
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:44,150
best if you're really only fighting on

1953
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:47,120
the stuff that doesn't comply with the

1954
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:49,549
norms but there's no way Cyber Command

1955
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,710
is going to allow adversary espionage to

1956
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:55,010
happen that's within norms and we're not

1957
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:56,750
going to contest that and so I I think

1958
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:59,900
it because everything that we do is

1959
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:03,440
going to be perceived as a signal and so

1960
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:05,929
if the Iranians are absolutely following

1961
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:09,919
the norms that are prescribed and so

1962
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:11,150
Cyber Command somehow says they're

1963
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,040
vulnerable you know they're vulnerable

1964
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:14,719
but we're not gonna we're not gonna kick

1965
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,310
them right which is not the military

1966
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,410
thing right they're down you finish off

1967
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:20,840
your adversary let's just say Cyber

1968
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:23,630
Command doesn't do that justice is still

1969
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,190
going to indict them because what

1970
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,690
they're doing is a crime and that's

1971
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:27,919
gonna be perceived by the Iranians as a

1972
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:29,929
strong signal from the United States

1973
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,430
them so it's got a lot of it's got a lot

1974
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,990
of problems with it and assuming that

1975
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:35,030
toss of tacit bargaining is gonna work I

1976
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:36,769
would just jump in only in the last part

1977
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,630
so I do I think there's an interesting

1978
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,700
question of what the tacit bargaining is

1979
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:42,260
with respect to the indictments right

1980
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,300
because it's clearly part of a strategy

1981
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:46,489
and there is prosecutorial discretion

1982
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,440
so in theory you could decide not to

1983
01:17:46,489 --> 01:17:49,610
prosecute but that is not the mindset in

1984
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,829
the US government right now but you

1985
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:54,110
could have a model where you say and I

1986
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:57,409
think part of part of the indictment

1987
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:59,119
strategy from 2015 on was in some ways

1988
01:17:57,409 --> 01:18:01,308
well we're not ready yet to come out and

1989
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:03,110
actually claim state X did it but we'll

1990
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,909
take five of their officers and put them

1991
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:06,920
out there are will docs this North

1992
01:18:04,909 --> 01:18:09,348
Korean agent and that will be how we

1993
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,880
communicate back to the capital you know

1994
01:18:09,349 --> 01:18:12,860
we think you've crossed some lines and

1995
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,510
you better rein it in at but you know at

1996
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,089
risks the you know you know some of our

1997
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:18,020
guys getting getting you know

1998
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:19,760
indictments and having not to travel in

1999
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:21,800
like the problem is as you say is what's

2000
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,570
the what's the what's their benefit or

2001
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,280
the positive reinforcement you can give

2002
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,719
and there's always the you know just

2003
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,780
because justice hasn't prosecuted you

2004
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,980
today you know you've got a long statute

2005
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,420
of limitations and the stuff and so

2006
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:34,459
that's the trouble I think is it could

2007
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,170
be you could restrain from prosecuting

2008
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,540
but a new prosecutor can come in on a

2009
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:42,230
moment's notice and you know go all

2010
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:43,969
legal on you if you take this question

2011
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:46,909
from a slightly different angle I think

2012
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:50,270
it could be interesting to explore what

2013
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:52,280
could be done in terms of limiting not

2014
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,409
the weapons because that is not a domain

2015
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:58,130
in which you can really control the

2016
01:18:54,409 --> 01:19:00,409
weapons the weapons are portable they

2017
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:01,849
can be recreated they can be hidden it

2018
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:03,769
is impossible to do that that

2019
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:05,210
traditional arms control approaches to

2020
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:07,880
this are very very difficult to apply

2021
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:12,949
what you can try and define is limiting

2022
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:15,829
the targets that is the the the holy

2023
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:17,329
grail of this discussion and reaching a

2024
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:18,739
degree of international consensus on

2025
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:19,699
limiting the targets in light of

2026
01:19:18,739 --> 01:19:21,379
international law including

2027
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:24,169
international humanitarian law and so

2028
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:26,210
and so forth and I think we are still as

2029
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:28,489
I said in uncharted territory because it

2030
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:31,099
is extremely difficult to detect certain

2031
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:34,489
operations it is sometimes difficult to

2032
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:36,710
unveil and call out certain operation it

2033
01:19:34,489 --> 01:19:38,388
is sometimes technically difficult the

2034
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:42,199
forensics could be complicated could

2035
01:19:38,389 --> 01:19:42,590
take time you may not want to show your

2036
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,290
hand

2037
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:46,639
what are your your sources in order to

2038
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:49,219
be able to attribute and even

2039
01:19:46,639 --> 01:19:51,559
attribution per se well is it going to

2040
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:53,239
deter bad behavior or is going to

2041
01:19:51,559 --> 01:19:55,670
escalate bad behavior and I think these

2042
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:56,169
are all issues on which it is still very

2043
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,450
difficult

2044
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:00,730
to make a financial coach ascertain is

2045
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:03,460
that we are all at the point at which

2046
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:05,200
doing nothing is no longer acceptable is

2047
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:06,790
no longer possible when bad behavior

2048
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:10,300
when malicious have relatives occur

2049
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:12,760
there is a energy to to make that clear

2050
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,930
that these are unacceptable forms of

2051
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,380
behavior there is another issue that

2052
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:20,290
goes beyond the bilateral bargaining and

2053
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:22,720
it is precisely because of the nature of

2054
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:27,360
of cyber activities there is a world

2055
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:29,620
global audience here and when there is a

2056
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,420
controversy between two parties a

2057
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:34,030
stricken party that is calling out the

2058
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:36,940
other party there is an audience of in

2059
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:39,009
the UN more than 100 countries and the

2060
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,660
resources of the wider public at home in

2061
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:43,060
our own countries that are there and

2062
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:45,010
listen to what is being said and I think

2063
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:47,200
this is also an argument a case that has

2064
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:52,090
to be won and it is important to be able

2065
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:54,760
also to change the mindset of certain

2066
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:56,410
so-called swing states they are cool

2067
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,020
like this for instance in UN General

2068
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,809
Assembly whose opinion is going to

2069
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:03,660
probably tip the balance between what I

2070
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:06,370
would call the political West

2071
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:09,330
like-minded countries and those actors

2072
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:11,590
the big actors on that instead they are

2073
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:13,780
against the full application of

2074
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:16,060
international law in cyberspace and tend

2075
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:17,860
to be behind the bad behavior the

2076
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:19,390
international level so there is also an

2077
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:21,490
international audience that you have to

2078
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:23,950
keep in mind and that is why this debate

2079
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:26,650
on limiting the targets is probably

2080
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:31,860
something we should pursue further thank

2081
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:34,360
you any other questions yes gentlemen

2082
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:36,009
thank you very much this is very

2083
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,679
American I'm from the shapes I of

2084
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:40,750
cyberspace operation center

2085
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:42,370
speaking of the deterrence resilience is

2086
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:44,320
the buzzword and seems to be the leading

2087
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:47,380
way to achieve the deterrence by denial

2088
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,820
by mainly academia and when we are

2089
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:50,680
talking about the resilience depending

2090
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,910
on whom we are talking sometimes we're

2091
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,790
talking about the resilience at the

2092
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:56,380
physical infrastructures and depending

2093
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:58,000
on whom we are talking sometimes we talk

2094
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:00,700
about the virtual networks and the

2095
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,590
resilience of the virtual layer and if

2096
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,510
not much but sometimes we talk about the

2097
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:07,180
persona layer and the resilience of the

2098
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:09,820
individuals but when we look at the

2099
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:12,910
election meddling in 2016

2100
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:14,920
in the reports when believe burrito no

2101
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:16,389
matter who won the elections it seems

2102
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,950
like we will end up reading the same

2103
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:20,710
reports but only the names will be

2104
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:22,480
different so the real target is not the

2105
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:24,850
candidate who lost the election but the

2106
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:28,509
real target seems to be the election

2107
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:30,880
system itself and the fairness and the

2108
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:32,650
trust of the society in the election

2109
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,350
systems and when we look at the election

2110
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:37,480
systems is the primary pillar of the

2111
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:39,910
democracy and democracy is one of the

2112
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,429
common values of the shared values of

2113
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:45,130
the Western cultures so all these like a

2114
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:48,010
layed out the real target seems to be

2115
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:50,650
the shared values of the society that's

2116
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:52,150
keeping all together basically so when

2117
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:54,670
we lose these look at the bonding

2118
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:57,160
elements there's not much left for the

2119
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:58,990
adversary to carry out further actions

2120
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,580
but just sitting back and watching us

2121
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:02,139
hurting each other because we all know

2122
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,580
that we're all capable of hurting each

2123
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:06,280
other when there is no other reason not

2124
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:08,460
to hurt each other so speaking of that

2125
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,200
the question what do you think about the

2126
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:12,940
resilience of the shared values which

2127
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:15,160
seems to be undermined in the

2128
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:17,169
discussions in the deterrence and what

2129
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:20,620
the nations and the organizations like

2130
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:23,200
the NATO and the EU should do must do to

2131
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:27,400
reinforce those shared values to keep us

2132
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:29,320
United and together we have one minute

2133
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:35,490
one minute

2134
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:37,360
each well I read recently a book that

2135
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:40,240
published in the United States title

2136
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:44,519
like war and it's about the misuse of

2137
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:47,710
social media in order to undermine our

2138
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,210
societies and I think this is what we

2139
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,680
are talking about election interference

2140
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,540
didn't occur only in the United States

2141
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,040
in 2016

2142
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:57,540
there is evidence that that occurred

2143
01:23:54,040 --> 01:24:00,070
during the referendum in the UK on view

2144
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:02,560
that it happened during the French

2145
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:04,360
presidential elections in 2017 and

2146
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,300
during the Catalan referendum on

2147
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:09,009
independence in 2017 so it is not

2148
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,380
limited to United States it shows a

2149
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:13,210
vulnerability that we have which is

2150
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:15,280
perhaps an intrinsic vulnerability of

2151
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:17,250
democratic societies that we are in

2152
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:20,440
favor of free speech and we are only

2153
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:21,260
belatedly recognizing that this is also

2154
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,388
being there

2155
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:26,030
voted against us that there is a clear

2156
01:24:23,389 --> 01:24:28,460
attack on social cohesion there is a

2157
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:30,170
clear attack on well you said the shared

2158
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:32,630
values the fundamental rules of our

2159
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:34,730
societies I think this is a something

2160
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:36,889
for the long haul it starts with

2161
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:39,739
education it starts with better

2162
01:24:36,889 --> 01:24:41,510
protecting networks it starts with

2163
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:43,699
better cooperation with the private

2164
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:46,099
sector these social platforms are owned

2165
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:48,018
by the private sector and unless we

2166
01:24:46,099 --> 01:24:50,869
manage to involve them more proactively

2167
01:24:48,019 --> 01:24:53,090
in helping us out in this it will be

2168
01:24:50,869 --> 01:24:54,949
very very difficult to build up

2169
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:56,570
sufficient defenses to this effect and

2170
01:24:54,949 --> 01:24:59,030
of course there are also limit to what

2171
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:00,619
international law can do in this

2172
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,449
particular domain also because we don't

2173
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:04,308
want to mirror the behavior of the other

2174
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:06,919
side we don't want to restrict our

2175
01:25:04,309 --> 01:25:08,300
liberties in order to defend our systems

2176
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,610
and so on and so forth so this is just

2177
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:13,400
to highlight the complexity of this that

2178
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:16,429
goes beyond the restricted limited the

2179
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:18,469
cyber deterrence issue and cyber

2180
01:25:16,429 --> 01:25:20,119
resilience we've got to get defence

2181
01:25:18,469 --> 01:25:21,440
better than offense right we've got to

2182
01:25:20,119 --> 01:25:22,820
switch things around so that the

2183
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:25,308
defender has the advantage over the

2184
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,230
attackers I think it's possible on the

2185
01:25:25,309 --> 01:25:28,699
values and thank you very much to talk

2186
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:30,500
about unity and values I think it's a

2187
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:33,320
nice way to finish off and it gives us

2188
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:35,809
another reason to thank Estonia and

2189
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:38,960
Tallinn and the CCDC UE this is my 10th

2190
01:25:35,809 --> 01:25:40,280
year I started coming in 2009 and it's a

2191
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,780
great opportunity for me to talk to my

2192
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,849
European colleagues and I think the

2193
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,409
places like the centre and NATO have

2194
01:25:43,849 --> 01:25:47,929
been fantastic at building that trough

2195
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:49,820
so my thanks yeah I would close also

2196
01:25:47,929 --> 01:25:51,559
echoing the thanks I think this is where

2197
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:53,179
whether it's International our cyber

2198
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:54,829
norms I mean part of the part of the

2199
01:25:53,179 --> 01:25:56,690
thing is remember that we're trying to

2200
01:25:54,829 --> 01:25:58,940
build shared expectations within a given

2201
01:25:56,690 --> 01:26:01,518
community and so that the challenge is

2202
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:02,570
how do we negotiate what what you know

2203
01:26:01,519 --> 01:26:04,579
and sometimes that community is all

2204
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:05,659
nation-states or the or the globe but

2205
01:26:04,579 --> 01:26:07,340
you know you you also have the

2206
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:09,110
opportunity and that should be the focus

2207
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:10,909
in terms of even if we can't get that

2208
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:13,130
what are the other communities in which

2209
01:26:10,909 --> 01:26:15,500
we want to settle what do we stand for

2210
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:16,909
so just like you know you know those of

2211
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:19,219
you in the military there's certain

2212
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:21,289
professional codes you know you have

2213
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:22,909
norms as parents you have norms as a

2214
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:24,559
member of a religious group you know

2215
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:26,869
part of the challenge for us with with

2216
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:28,280
cyber is you know figuring out what are

2217
01:26:26,869 --> 01:26:29,389
the norms of democracies that we're

2218
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:32,059
going to accept and we're going to fight

2219
01:26:29,389 --> 01:26:34,010
for to reinforce those social values and

2220
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:34,740
so you know it's not necessarily a legal

2221
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:37,590
question it's a

2222
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:38,940
geological one of how do we sustain and

2223
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,910
maintain that because otherwise you're

2224
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:44,190
right I think we we can see things fray

2225
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:45,960
quickly and unfortunately great thank

2226
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:48,629

2228
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:53,490
