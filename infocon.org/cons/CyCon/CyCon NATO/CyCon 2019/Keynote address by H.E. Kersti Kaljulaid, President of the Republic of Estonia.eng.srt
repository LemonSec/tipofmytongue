1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,609
thank you for the warm welcome

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:09,990
excellencies generals ladies gentlemen I

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:11,670
thought about this 60 versus 1000 I

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,400
think this is the essence of the cyber

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,378
it all may always seems that there are

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
many when there are few people think

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,730
there are 10 million Estonians globally

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,449
in fact that is 1 million of course

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,430
people think that cyber center in

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,570
Tallinn consists of much more than 60

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,099
people because they are simply

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,630
everywhere and they are high-flying

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,850
people and we have recognized it because

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,339
we have appointed an Air Force is : all

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,530
to keep order in the house so thank you

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,000
York thank you for the introduction and

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,160
thank you and your colleagues or the

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,769
cyber defence centre for organizing this

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,078
great conference and thank you dear

20
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,510
friends for coming to telling yet again

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,760
I do believe that saikhan has over the

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,010
years developed one of the hallmark

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,289
conferences for all cyber people and

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,500
that you all come to tell in each year

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,809
with the hope of hearing and learning

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,430
something you haven't heard Elsa and I

27
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,630
assure you that you will not be

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,790
disappointed I this year I am glad to

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,710
introduce here the Estonian positions on

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,110
how international law applies in

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,419
cyberspace which were approved by the

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,470
Estonian government just a couple of

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,509
weeks ago yes some NATO allies and

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,220
partner countries already have declared

35
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,009
their positions on this issue

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,689
and also we already do have the Italian

37
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,430
manuals of course in place which

38
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,119
contributed an important first step

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,860
towards the analysis of this issue we

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,110
also have the reports of the United

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,610
Nations groups of governmental experts

42
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,789
and statements by a number of

43
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,310
international organizations but in some

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,350
ways it was actually even a little bit

45
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,750
weird that the Stonier the forefront

46
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,179
country of the topic hadn't actually

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,360
drafted and approved these positions

48
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,570
officially until now and that was the

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:03,299
reason why I last year after we had the

50
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:06,859
three of LMC MSC cyber digital here in

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,780
Tallinn and of course also saikhan I

52
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,100
convened the best cyber law experts in

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,110
Estonia to my office and

54
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,380
disgust station and they readily agreed

55
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,270
that yes it's time with all the things

56
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,820
considered we can and should compile

57
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:26,770
this position no and we set ourselves

58
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,600
the target of today I know that there

59
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,450
are many countries who are and will

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,030
remain ambitious on this issue but

61
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,179
Estonia is a small state and we do not

62
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,790
have this kind of luxury in regards to

63
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,310
international law because as Leonard

64
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,489
Murray our first post-cold-war president

65
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,930
once famously stated international law

66
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,000
is the nuclear weapon of a small state

67
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,130
before introducing Estonian positions on

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,230
international law in cyberspace I

69
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,290
believe that the short explanation is in

70
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,590
place why this all is actually so vital

71
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,900
for us in the first place

72
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,770
most of you here might think that it is

73
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,410
self-evident

74
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,530
why linkage between cyber international

75
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:14,560
law and security is so important but if

76
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,290
asked by a man on the street and let's

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,480
not forget that man is the end-user of

78
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,750
IT products as well as part of the

79
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,700
security that we all strive to create

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,430
then we must always remind the basics of

81
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,070
security and international law let's

82
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,350
take for example NATO and the

83
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,660
conventional domain during the same two

84
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,970
year history of NATO new ally has

85
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,640
actually been conventionally attacked or

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,160
lost it serenity and that's because

87
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,049
NATO's collective defense posture at

88
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,329
least in the conventional domain has

89
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,270
been and will remain to be a credible

90
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,430
deterrent nobody still dares to cross

91
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,780
NATO as the consequences would be no

92
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,370
clear and devastating and if we think of

93
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,670
some of the basic tenets of the

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,920
international law system then yes

95
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,869
international law and organizations have

96
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,540
not been able to end all wars and the

97
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,030
gues aggressions but everybody clearly

98
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,480
knows that when you breach international

99
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,480
law it will be taken up for sure in the

100
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,120
United Nations Security Council and it

101
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,020
always has consequences and therefore

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,210
also acts as a deterrent but that's only

103
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,549
happening in the conventional domain

104
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,979
for some reasons the same principles

105
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,610
remain ambiguous in cyber domain to say

106
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,880
the least

107
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,889
although they shouldn't today be still

108
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,810
possible for another Surya country to

109
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,389
carry out the malicious cyber operation

110
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,270
or a number of them simultaneously and

111
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,280
get away with it or all must get away

112
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,930
since at least on attribution a lot of

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
progress has been achieved over the last

114
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,419
years but one of the reasons for this is

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,500
that cyber still leaves a lot of gray

116
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,820
areas including on halt precisely

117
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,880
international law applies in cyber

118
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:04,240
sphere international law stems from

119
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,710
conventions agreements and custom but

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,020
it's still very much up to States

121
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,219
themselves to define and to interpret

122
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,570
that law therefore the Estonian

123
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,000
positions on application of

124
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,280
international law in cyberspace is our

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,280
contribution on further clarifying this

126
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,460
issue and leading the way together with

127
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,919
other allies it's also something that

128
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,859
will help our cyber experts in everyday

129
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,280
operations in drafting our own rules of

130
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,050
engagement for possible cyber operations

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,299
it might also carry some deterring

132
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,090
effects as we have no more clarity in

133
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,960
how we perceive and react to cyber

134
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,638
operations in the future ladies and

135
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,530
gentlemen they are still in an official

136
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,430
position on international law in

137
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,650
cyberspace is the following first of all

138
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,360
as also many states and several

139
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,469
international organizations have

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,979
acknowledged existing international law

141
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:06,909
applies in cyberspace among others the

142
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:09,699
European Union NATO oacd and ASEAN have

143
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:12,490
made similar addresses Estonia has

144
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,710
constantly upheld this position we do

145
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,570
believe and state that both the rights

146
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,849
and obligations of international law

147
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:22,090
including those stated in the United

148
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:24,849
Nations Charter do apply to States when

149
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,729
using IT and communication technologies

150
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:30,039
and for that we believe that the Tallinn

151
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,258
manuals mostly developed academic

152
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,039
understanding of existing international

153
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,630
law I would like to reiterate when it

154
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,830
comes to legal questions of do's and

155
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,840
don'ts

156
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,830
surrounding state behavior in cyberspace

157
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:49,690
the answer must be sought from existing

158
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,758
international law secondly states are

159
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,210
responsible for their activities in

160
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,990
cyberspace sovereign it entails not only

161
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,270
rights but also obligations states are

162
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,569
responsible for their internationally

163
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,190
wrongful cyber operations just as they

164
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,800
would be responsible for any other

165
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,789
activity based on international treaties

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,400
or customary international law this is

167
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,199
the case whether or not such acts are

168
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,659
carried out by state organs or by

169
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,990
non-state actors supported or controlled

170
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:25,690
by the state states cannot waive their

171
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,259
responsibility by carrying out malicious

172
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,000
cyber operations via non-state actors if

173
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:36,270
a cyber operation violates international

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,280
law this needs to be called out thirdly

175
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,109
states must keep on strengthening their

176
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,239
own resilience to cyber threats and

177
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,240
disruptions both individually and

178
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,669
collectively

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,000
therefore states have to make reasonable

180
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:54,130
efforts to ensure that their territory

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,830
is not used to adversely affect the

182
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,930
rights of other states they should

183
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,419
strive to develop me in stro for support

184
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,789
when requested by the injured state in

185
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:07,740
order to identify attribute or

186
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:10,659
investigate malicious cyber operations

187
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,080
this expectation depends on national

188
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:16,659
capacity as well as availability and

189
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,460
accessibility of information as I

190
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,529
mentioned here last year we have to also

191
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,568
consider that capacities of different

192
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,550
states to be able to control such

193
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,840
operations that exploit their

194
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,219
infrastructure or systems therefore

195
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,208
meeting this expectation should

196
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:36,250
encompass taking all feasible measures

197
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:39,789
rather than achieving concrete results

198
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,099
and this also means that further effort

199
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,069
must go to cyber capacity building and

200
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,410
development cooperation to increase

201
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,980
state's capacity to prevent and respond

202
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,600
to cyber threats I hope that the stoner

203
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,910
can serve as a model in part

204
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,310
with other countries especially in

205
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,009
assisting those that do not have robust

206
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,529
enough cyber different systems our

207
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:05,410
attention so far has been to Georgia and

208
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:08,170
Ukraine countries that phase constant

209
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,540
malicious cyber operations because by

210
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:15,519
the end of the day our own cyber

211
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:18,819
security also depends on this the fourth

212
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,100
point states have the right to attribute

213
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:24,069
cyber operations both individually and

214
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,880
collectively according to international

215
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:30,069
law our ability and readiness to

216
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,490
effectively cooperate among allies and

217
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,839
partners in exchanging information and

218
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,079
attributing malicious cyber activities

219
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,329
has improved the opportunities for

220
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,459
malicious actors to walk away from their

221
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:46,689
harmful actions with plausible

222
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:48,910
deniability are clearly shrinking last

223
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,220
year demonstrated that states are able

224
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,370
to attribute harmful cyber operations

225
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,490
both individually or in a coordinated

226
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:00,670
manner it is not something unachievable

227
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,279
and endlessly complex at the end of the

228
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,699
day what is required from the attribute

229
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,939
in state is not absolute certainty but

230
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:12,639
what is reasonable when assessing

231
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:15,819
malicious cyber operations we can

232
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,639
consider technical information political

233
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:23,589
context established behavioural patterns

234
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:26,050
and all other relevant indicators more

235
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,930
than simple attribute think we must take

236
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,870
a stance that harmful cyber operations

237
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:34,680
cannot be carried out without

238
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,569
consequences one good example would be

239
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,479
European Union's cyber diplomacy toolbox

240
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,329
which 4c is a framework for joint EU

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,050
diplomatic response to malicious cyber

242
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:49,479
activities two weeks ago EU Member

243
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,029
States agreed on a horizontal framework

244
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,060
which will allow to impose restrictive

245
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:58,389
measures or sanctions against malicious

246
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,180
cyber operations in similar manner as it

247
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,790
is possible for terrorist acts or use of

248
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,229
chemical weapons

249
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,519
saral allies have already taken

250
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,009
diplomatic step

251
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,949
or set in place economic restrictive

252
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:14,079
measures against other seller states or

253
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:18,819
individuals responsible for harmful

254
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,769
cyber operations and now to the fifth

255
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:24,490
and final point of the Estonian

256
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:28,110
positions namely states have the right

257
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,540
to react to malicious cyber operations

258
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,569
including using diplomatic response but

259
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:39,910
also countermeasures and if necessary

260
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:41,559
the inherent right of self-defense cyber

261
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,559
should no longer look like an easy

262
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:47,459
choice of weapons and therefore we must

263
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:51,490
be ready to use deterrence tools

264
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:54,160
first and foremost states must refrain

265
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,189
from the threat of our use of force

266
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,509
against the territorial integrity and

267
00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:03,309
political independence of other states

268
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,559
however we already know that cyber

269
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:07,809
operations which cause injury or death

270
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,929
to persons or damage or destruction of

271
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:15,429
objects could amount to use of force or

272
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:17,910
armed attack under the UN Charter we

273
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:21,610
here in Estonia are very much dependent

274
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,529
on a stable and secure cyberspace such

275
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,589
harmful effects could be caused by a

276
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:28,860
cyber operation which for example

277
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:31,569
targets our digital infrastructure or

278
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,209
services necessary for the functioning

279
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:39,339
of the society here and let's not forget

280
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,859
growing digitalization of our societies

281
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:45,129
and services can also lower the

282
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,949
threshold for harmful effects in order

283
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:50,499
to prevent such effects States maintain

284
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:53,920
all rights in accordance with

285
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:57,339
international law to respond to harmful

286
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:01,089
cyber operations either individually or

287
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,769
in a collective manner among other

288
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,649
options for collective response

289
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,809
Estonia is further in the position that

290
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,629
states which are not directly injured

291
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:13,509
may apply countermeasures to support the

292
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:17,049
state directly affected by the malicious

293
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,120
cyber operation the countermeasures

294
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,230
applied should follow the principle of

295
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,270
proportionality

296
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,930
and other principles established within

297
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,760
the international customary law

298
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:30,430
international security and the

299
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,800
rules-based international order have

300
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,040
long benefited from collective efforts

301
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,319
to stop the violations we have seen this

302
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,219
practice in the form of collective

303
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,960
self-defense against armed attacks for

304
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,630
malicious cyber operations we are

305
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,530
starting to see this in collective

306
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,170
diplomatic measures I mentioned before

307
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,850
the threats to the security of states

308
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,969
increasingly involve unlawful cyber

309
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:01,030
operations it is therefore important

310
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,790
that states may respond collectively to

311
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:08,860
unlawful cyber operations where

312
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:12,360
diplomatic action is insufficient but no

313
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:19,090
lawful recourse to use of force exists

314
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:20,830
allies matter also in cyberspace thank

315
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,250
you for listening for Estonian positions

316
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:26,010
now as you see in many ways there is

317
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,630
nothing really special or groundbreaking

318
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,740
but I do believe that it's really

319
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:34,510
important to get them clearly stated and

320
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,540
I am sure that it certainly doesn't end

321
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,460
here I believe that all states should

322
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,120
articulate their positions on how

323
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,530
international law applies in cyberspace

324
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,870
we do look forward to the fruitful

325
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,670
discussions on this issue during new

326
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,610
working groups established by the

327
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,620
secretary-general of the United Nations

328
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,480
having been also part of each and every

329
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,790
previously established such working

330
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,430
group in addition to measuring the

331
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,319
perception of existing law we must

332
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,569
collectively put our effort to implement

333
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,720
those provisions we have already agreed

334
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:11,050
upon including norms of responsible

335
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,270
state behavior in cyberspace and call

336
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,520
out those who undermine our efforts to

337
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:20,590
ensure a peace and stability in

338
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:23,560
cyberspace and we all governments civil

339
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,750
society industry we have the

340
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,119
responsibility to strengthen the

341

technologies and there is
