investigation it's a tool based and on

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,140

today is a specific life form remote

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,550
forensic investigations especially in

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,700
the context of the Kovach 19 because

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,980
yeah probably most of the attendees are

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,530
stuck at home working remotely for a few

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,380
months now but the business must go on

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,490
the the you have to put you to providers

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,450
so it would be interesting to have nice

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,520
remote to to continue to provide your

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,680
best services to your customers so a few

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,900
words about myself so my name is dahee

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,680
also known as it's me on twitter i'm

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,010
quite proud of me to be a speaker for

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,620
the third time at pass the salt so thank

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,930
you guys for accepting my tools every

32
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,630
year so it meter I hope that it's

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,330
interesting for him otherwise I'm a

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,150
freelance based in Belgium I consider

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,369
myself more as a blue teamers so it

36
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,399
means that I'm doing more and more

37
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,080
defensive security and I try to protect

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,329
my customers the data and their assets

39
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm also a Suns Internet's home center

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,099
and I'm a co-organizer of the different

41
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,970
security profiles the talk today will be

42
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,420
quite short so I don't have a lot of

43
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,099
time to present you all the features

44
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,250
around the tool so I will not show the

45
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,170
question at the end of the presentation

46
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,150
but also if you have more questions if

47
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,830
you like to chat we can click into a

48
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,810
discussion so just follow me on Twitter

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,819
and I will be happy to like you and to

50
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,440
continue to provide you information

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,989
about so yeah we all know that 2020 if

52
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,080
we can control Zito and do for this year

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,300
would be perfect because it's really

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,330
right I think so

55
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,660
2030 change the behavior all the

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,580
behavior what we work how we have

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,730
contact with the people but of course we

58
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,470
have quite we are working in a nice

59
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,540
thing so in in from security because we

60
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,209
are able to work from almost anywhere

61
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,430
I'm working from anywhere from home from

62
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,280
any location when I had my parents on

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,590
the road and so on but of course we need

64
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,230
to have more mobile tools to provide

65
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,170
such kind of services so my ID beyond

66
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,780
this was it's good good opportunity to

67
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,739
present you the tool today to perform so

68
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,989
more and more investigation will not be

69
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,070
and safety I'm pretty sure that

70
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,530
everybody face this situation so if you

71
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,690
are if you are involved in incident

72
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,900
handling forensic investigation it's

73
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,000
always like this Friday 10:00 p.m. you

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,290
want relaxed at home with your family

75
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,510
watching the movie or having good times

76
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,459
with friends and suddenly the phone

77
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,980
rings because you are on duty it happens

78
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,840
from time to time and you have a

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,209
customer who calls you and say oh you

80
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,880
need to come as soon as possible to

81
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,799
investigate the incident because we have

82
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,250
suspicions about a user about system and

83
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,260
of course the customer is located far

84
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,269
away from you you don't have time to

85
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,900
drive or like we do today we simply we

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,389
cannot travel easy especially if it's

87
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,400
outside Europe it's always like this and

88
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
many many incident do not say all

89
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,460
incidents occur always at the wrong

90
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,550
I don't know if you remember when I cry

91
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,440
so you see on the right of my slide a

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,500
nice screen shot when you up here for

93
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,600
the first time it was May 12 in 2017 and

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,430
I remember this day because I was on

95
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,169
duty for the Internet's own Center and

96
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,900
when it really started to infect more

97
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,150
and more networks basically it was

98
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,639
Friday in so we had very good times

99
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,740
because we were anxious to get in skirt

100
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,860
we receive we received information from

101
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,780
everywhere so basically it's always

102
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,720
happened at the worst moment so it must

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,110
be ready to deploy tools and to not lose

104
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:13,990
time by traveling points my mouth like

105
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,680
this so a few words about forensic the

106
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,090
goal of this presentation is not to

107
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,530
explain you how to do for in six

108
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,810
vestigation totally not the goal the

109
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,810
goal is to present you a tool which can

110
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,150
which is based on many forensic tools

111
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,729
that could be deployed in a few minutes

112
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,550
to investigate an incident but it's not

113
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,919
my goal is not to explain you how to do

114
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,340
the investigations but basically for

115
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,680
investigation they are based on the

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,750
collection of relevant data on the

117
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,539
compromised system and very important in

118
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,880
the same way by Safeway I mean that you

119
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,880
cannot change the of course the the data

120
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,919
you must be sure that you don't you

121
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,410
don't alter the evidences and you need

122
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,099
to collect artifacts which are basic

123
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,770
ones file systems files directories a

124
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,530
memorandum except the registry it is a

125
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,639
Windows system but also useful artifacts

126
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,320
coming from third-party applications or

127
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,300
not directly based on us but you can

128
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,910
have for example the browsing history

129
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,490
it's very interesting because the victim

130
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,270
could have you may find which web design

131
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,979
have been visited by the team just

132
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,539
before the infection and so basically

133
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,580
the forensic is just collecting all this

134
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,580
kind of information to be able to guess

135
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,020
what happens and

136
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,610
take action to remedy the incident to do

137
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,330
this of course we need some tools so you

138
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,450
need a toolbox every forensic Gator has

139
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,010
a different tool box so you have very

140
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,400
good to serving notice we no tools but

141
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,040
everybody has its small bunch of scripts

142
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,900
Python Perl script on in a specific

143
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,630
utility that you use and you can find

144
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,700
plenty of them some of them are based on

145
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,710
agent so it means that you already have

146
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,570
a small agent running and computer on

147
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,070
the endpoint and this agent is very

148
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,630
interesting because it helps you to

149
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,390
automatically collect information from

150
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,850
the system even if it's located far away

151
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,260
on the other side of the world

152
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,720
a few thousand kilometers some of them

153
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
are the well-known and case which is

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,260
very expensive but works quite well

155
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,880
Google Rapid Response mode VI

156
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,120
investigator OS query over sake and so

157
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,980
on and so on so use the yo-yo preferred

158
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,500
form but you can also as on demand dues

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,840
like the six partition the developer

160
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,410
cells which is also a live CD and this

161
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,880
live CB has a bunch of tools already

162
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,940
installed and the the workstation

163
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,200
absolute to do the basic forensics steps

164
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,650
during the incident management it's a

165
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,000
nice live CD but the main issue received

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,510
is that it's a largely and you have to

167
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,900
boot your sift workstation to take

168
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,300
evidences but you also need to be on

169
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,150
site to use different tools all you need

170
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,700
to have skilled customer scheme user and

171
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,680
ask them please do that please do that

172
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,510
to dissection this one this one this one

173
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,910
and everybody knows that it's not the

174
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,040
best situation when you are facing a big

175
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
incident because people are quite

176
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,220
stressed they are overloaded by other

177
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,500
tasks so they don't explain they don't

178
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,839
have the skill or the skills to do that

179
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,559
so C is a nice tool but for me the

180
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,229
the biggest issue is that you don't you

181
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,260
cannot prepare it and to use it from a

182
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,920
remote location very easy so the

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,490
requirements based on my experience for

184
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:50,880
me

185
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,590
we need something which is easy and

186
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,630
quickly deploy of course if a customer

187
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,970
call you you don't have time to spend

188
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,210
two days to prepare your tool box the

189
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,839
tool must be available be online to be

190
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,790
downloaded by the customer and deploy it

191
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,860
in a few minutes let's say maximum in a

192
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,230
few hours it must be for insecurely

193
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,870
aware so far it's equally a relative in

194
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,730
mind again

195
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,420
it must be able to take evidences in a

196
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,900
safe way to not break the do not have

197
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,750
any evidences it was have your tool box

198
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,120
pre-installed as I said your tool box is

199
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,970
your Aldo box you must be able to do

200
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,930
this management

201
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,360
so this manage this but also mount

202
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,880
resistant for multiple operating system

203
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,500
just think about NTFS explore xqe all

204
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,130
kind of the mac OS file system and so on

205
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,320
you have also interaction with user

206
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,440
which is quite interesting what does it

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,380
mean customers they like to be in

208
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,180
contact with you during investigation

209
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,670
and if you can show in almost real-time

210
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,100
information with them it's always a good

211
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,490
point

212
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,560
it must be compatible with many

213
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,280
networking system the customer must be

214
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,650
able to keep control is very important

215
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,720
because if the customer has the feeling

216
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,580
that is it's because it's his home

217
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,700
system so the customers must remain in

218
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,370
control and we must do so much ability

219
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,620
to control its own system even your

220
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,690
investigation it's a good point for you

221
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,330
and of course a low bandwidth usage so

222
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,150
all the data must be processed remotely

223
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,190
and you just connect and you just

224
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,610
grabbed

225
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,220
locally only the result of investigation

226
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,650
so for example today we have laptops

227
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,470
with minimum 16 32 gigs of memory if you

228
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,300
need to take a memory image and then

229
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,310
download is they will image locally it

230
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,320
will take a huge amount of time which is

231
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,710
always a bad point when you need to

232
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,740
to investigate as soon as possible so

233
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,420
let's talk about the tuna so the goal

234
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,530
the to disco disco it's a custom custom

235
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,900
is I don't live always consider based on

236
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,440
bash which is nice because first it's

237
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,630
alive Linux OS it's based on Google too

238
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,330
it's very simple you can customize it at

239
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,210
birth time you can extend it at runtime

240
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,340
very important so what does it mean if

241
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,020
you don't have a tool you don't have a

242
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,720
script installed by default on life's be

243
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,030
you can always install it why you want

244
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,890
to make your investigations it has a

245
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,290
minimal system requirements it uses low

246
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,200
bandwidth and of course a VPN to encrypt

247
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
all the data between you and the

248
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,880
customer it has a privilege is related

249
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,590
access we've been coming back to this in

250
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,930
a few minutes and is based on two rows

251
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,930
the expert and opponent the expert is

252
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,900
the forensic guy and the bounder is

253
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,770
basically datastore so the key points

254
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,290
four bits code you have some kind of

255
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,480
different layer like the OSI model so on

256
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,920
your right you see that you are starting

257
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
from bottom to top we have the live CP

258
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,810
then we have the overleaf and system we

259
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,850
have a bind filesystem you have the root

260
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,500
filesystem which is basically container

261
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,750
because all your environment runs in a

262
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,780
container then you have evidences you

263
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,940
take snapshots because we're human

264
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,190
installed on the live CD and then you

265
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,820
can also execute and boot the system

266
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,410
virtually through the live CD to take

267
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,420
evidence so we have multiple layers like

268
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,190
this and to keep on so the first one the

269
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,760
expert is root only in his restricted

270
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,520
environment so when the last is booted

271
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,650
when I connect to the live CD

272
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,870
I'm connected and connected in my own

273
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,060
daughter I don't home the system I have

274
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,760
only access to the file system and to

275
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,830
the system that dedication that the

276
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,680
customer provides to me nothing else so

277
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,020
it means that I will not be able to scan

278
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,870
to connect and to grab information from

279
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,790
the complete network it has many

280
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,010
different layers like we saw you see on

281
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,940
the right it access only authorized

282
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,720
resources and also the prevents

283
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,540
tampering of civilians so the

284
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,899
architecture is quite simple you are the

285
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,930
expert on the top and you are connected

286
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,089
troops of freedom will be a laptop my

287
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,730
MacBook at home at work all the customer

288
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,480
premises and the owner goods the lamb

289
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,889
see only system

290
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,290
the system can be booted on the physical

291
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,959
system using real life see a USB stick

292
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,060
but you can also boot it on a virtual

293
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,089
system so you just deploy the ISO file

294
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,829
in your data store for very six for

295
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,720
example and you go to a trot system in a

296
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,879
complete environment and once the system

297
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,420
is booted the owner as you see just a

298
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,129
small screenshot it has this kind of

299
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,620
very easy console where I can do

300
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,269
specific basic tasks we will talk about

301
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,339
this in a few minutes and what's

302
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,379
important automatically when the live CP

303
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,019
has booted it will just open the VPN

304
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,209
connection back to the experts and the

305
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,819
expert will be able to SSH to the doctor

306
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,279
and to start investigations please point

307
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,040
the owner and the expert can always chat

308
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,560
using an internal energy system so we

309
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,300
can discuss and we can always exchange

310
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,079
information

311
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,089
oh please give me this password please

312
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,040
give me to do tell me where it's located

313
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,819
this file you are always in contact with

314
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:21,930
your with your customer a very good

315
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,029
point is the configuration customization

316
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,360
so you cannot download bits code like

317
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,800
this and you cannot execute that

318
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,089
language were to prepare your

319
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,009
personality so fine so for example for

320
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:34,439
my company my business I my own personal

321
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,290
is a file why because first it connects

322
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,870
with again so you need to prepare the

323
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,389
VPN configuration because it goes back

324
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,730
to my own VPN server you need to set up

325
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,309
SSH key means you need to set up the RSC

326
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,889
which kind of channel you would like to

327
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,709
have and to do burn to discuss customer

328
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:57,059
so a very important point the expert so

329
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,519
you the forensic people you need to

330
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,620
deploy some server I need to have an

331
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,689
infrastructure you need a VPN server in

332
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:06,839
the night in the syslog server and many

333
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,139
more if you deploy extra tools so you

334
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,050
need to prepare

335
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,850
the customization is very easy because

336
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,880
as its it's displayed on the

337
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,529
presentation of its code it's based on

338
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,560
bash script very easy so you don't have

339
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,870
to be a high speed developer if you can

340
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,820
write a simple bash script you can

341
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,220
install your own tools so basically you

342
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,160
see on the screenshot that US different

343
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,680
scripts depending on the installation

344
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,040
steps for example you have chain root in

345
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,860
store for in six install custom install

346
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,050
general install remote access and so on

347
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,630
and once you created on your script so

348
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,160
you can add your own script as you want

349
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,240
you just have to make dot same script to

350
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,610
build the issue image and this image is

351
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,589
available for your personal of course we

352
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,510
have to test it to test it several times

353
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,880
to be sure that it's stable it works

354
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,730
that the VPN key is the SSH keys

355
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,160
appropriate all but what's it what once

356
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,130
it's done your ISO file is ready so the

357
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,220
ISO file is available on my company web

358
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,470
server and any customer is free to

359
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,130
download it immediately when you retries

360
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,160
asked me to do some investigation when

361
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,529
you boot it how to boot it so you can

362
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:28,949
boot you can burn a CD that's the whole

363
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:32,160
session own method you can generate USB

364
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,529
stick or you can just actually so far

365
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,690
you know data store or to your place

366
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,149
when you have your in your future

367
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,730
environment and you can just in this

368
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,740
state you can create a temporary VM and

369
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,470
you a scientist officials indicated or

370
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,220
you can just put the compromise game

371
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,750
using the the ISO file and of course

372
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,190
it's very important for your customer

373
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,740
the line she needs some different access

374
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,800
at least DNS resolution and in DD here

375
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,709
Evan 94 for the VPN to be able to come

376
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,309
back my chickens or your VPN server so

377
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,549
very easy deploy and I have quick

378
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,470
documentation for my customers so they

379
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,270
just haven't documentation piggy file

380
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,730
how to do this they install the ISO file

381
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,660
they put it and I'm just monitoring the

382
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,459
the pullback and when I see the Vivian

383
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,770
Vivian sub I cannot open a stock

384
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,360
institutions of course--but code so that

385
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,780
you're likely will be deployed in in a

386
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,730
specific environment and you don't know

387
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,410
the environment so it means that it must

388
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,200
be very very configurable we get in the

389
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,480
network and the network set up you can

390
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,580
you can work by default it will try to

391
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,490
section IP address from DHCP but you can

392
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,919
specify a static IP address so the

393
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,470
customer is able to specify the stick IP

394
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,440
it can configure proxy a socks proxy it

395
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,780
can also store for SSIDs and connect

396
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,830
Wi-Fi settings to be a DVD a WEP

397
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,049
whatever you want so basically it can

398
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,919
connect on any any network remember that

399
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,840
the goal is to open the zpm back to the

400
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,789
expert system and then the expert it

401
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,870
goes just SSH using a specific SSH key

402
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,120
which is installed on the live CD the

403
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,919
public key and it will have access to

404
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,130
the base code system it was a quick

405
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,559
introduction very quick one no I will

406
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,299
present you some demos and you will see

407
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,850
you in real time because I did not have

408
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,830
recording I will do I will do everything

409
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,919
live some demos to prove you and to show

410
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,669
you how it works

411
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:41,730
so the first demo is just the network

412
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,380
setup and remote access so I will show

413
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,640
you this live yeah let's switch like

414
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,809
this so this over to system consider it

415
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,809
done it's the expert system I would just

416
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:58,140
do but pings to my to the IP address of

417
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,429
my of the live CD which and you see that

418
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,770
the system is not live I will just boot

419
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:14,549
my cm so it's a classic live CD so you

420
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:21,260
just keep it boot and do all the setup

421
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,020
so the the the lobby's design this

422
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,320
virtual machine this one as VMDK

423
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,899
attached to it and the VMDK is a Windows

424
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:36,370
7 operating system Windows 7 post so I

425
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,289
will be able to do to make you some

426
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,120
demos with it

427
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,399
so it's booted you see immediately that

428
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,779
my Vivian is up so no I can SSH to the

429
00:19:46,779 --> 00:20:07,630
system here we go I'm on the system so

430
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,380
in this case the the the customer had

431
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,480
nothing to do because by default the

432
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,990
live CD grabs an IP address we had HTTP

433
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,159
we got a default gateway DNS servers and

434
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,010
it is able to refine this vidiian server

435
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,169
and to call into fonville but you see

436
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:27,760
that for the customer from the coastal

437
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,010
zone this is the crystal system this one

438
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,649
the blue-screen it's very easy you see

439
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,260
you have a quick introduction network

440
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,809
configuration disk status supervised

441
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,929
chat we will come back to these

442
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,399
different options later but it's very

443
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:44,980
convenient so network you can just

444
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,230
enable host control you can do two

445
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,399
static IP syslog Wi-Fi settings very

446
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:52,270
easy for the user

447
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,750
because it's just a simple simple menu

448
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,960
and if you go to status you do you the

449
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
customer is able to see your messages to

450
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,190
different routes

451
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,890
what is the VPN up and running and so on

452
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:18,159
and so on is very very good so no my

453
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,980
system is let's go back to the slides

454
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,140
this is the first of all so we see that

455
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,450
in a few seconds so the customer don't

456
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,610
know that Lisa five booted Lisa file and

457
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,250
you have access to remote system again

458
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,669
when you are on this system you are in a

459
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,600
container and I don't have access

460
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,809
to the customer network so I cannot

461
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,269
start a Bing I cannot serve using his

462
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,009
proxy I cannot mount the sand beaches

463
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,679
and so on manifold of course you can do

464
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,019
it so if you give you access to mount

465
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,750
I simply share to a temporary file to

466
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,000
them some stuff it's available by

467
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
default who are we doing the respected

468
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,519
environment so what about this

469
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,340
management which is the key point

470
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,139
by default the the knives we will be

471
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,970
will have the MD case attached or will

472
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,740
have a physical this let's let's see I

473
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,600
suppose it's slash such as Sdn and the

474
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,759
goal is to create mappings to be able to

475
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,279
work on evidence file system so you will

476
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,190
never work directly on the physical or

477
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,440
the real file system you will work on

478
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,029
evidence I stand to do this the customer

479
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,659
must create some mappings so how does it

480
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,740
work I will go to the disc menu and by

481
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,840
default you can see what's attached to

482
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,179
the to the live CD so as I said I

483
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,659
attached Windows System host so I have a

484
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,149
slash dev slash SDA available and you

485
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:53,129
see the two Commons partitions the first

486
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:56,570
one and the second one which is the real

487
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,200
operating sense of SDA 1 st 2 which are

488
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,529
NTFS and it's up to the customer to give

489
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,830
you access to the file system which are

490
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,110
necessary to need investigation so it

491
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,909
keeps the front row it's very important

492
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,100
you may not have access to slash such a

493
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,320
big and to do this the Christopher lose

494
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,269
mouth some drives

495
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:21,690
drag and make another girl for you so to

496
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,490
do a map you can map the complete disk

497
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,679
but you can also map a specific file

498
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,600
system to specific partition so let's

499
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,100
map as they do and then you select if

500
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,860
you want to map on a read-only file

501
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,799
system or reply file system of course

502
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,210
you still agreed only because you don't

503
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,940
want to break evidences so you map it to

504
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,899
evidence and no you have max SDK to do

505
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:50,210
No if we do with you the customer is

506
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,070
able to see the stickers so you see the

507
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,289
physical drives and no here existing

508
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,990
mappings VF 1 SD 2 which is mapped to

509
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,080
digital self so no from an expert

510
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,640
perspective if I do have this tractor

511
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:16,720
goes evidence zero you see that so I can

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,310
this I do know this but I mean this one

523
00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:07,020
is d2 again I'm a complete this

let's make this one on evidence one

00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,720
yes institutions did oh-ho-ho-ho-ho

528
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:07,470
movie in monkeys and this and map again

529
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,900
is due to a evidence

530
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,490
why

531
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:38,629
sorry for this guy

532
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,880
what is this

533
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,659
I know okay to sing on I will just stop

534
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,720
this sorry for this for us I will use

535
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,159
another version of the lines because

536
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,720
it's the one of the last one that I

537
00:28:51,720 --> 00:29:07,820
created but say means I will use another

538
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,840
like this one is an old version I don't

539
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,250
know probably I have an issue with my

540
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,700
tooth

541
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,269
sorry for this

542
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,780
okay we start my seashell

544
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,040
it's normal

545
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:33,180
okay so restarts go to my this having

546
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,880
your mouth I mean map this one is we do

547
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,690
evidence we'd only

548
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,659
[Music]

549
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,539
Arielle so no I wanted my fan system and

550
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,850
you recognize that have access to a

551
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,700
classic Windows fast tempo program five

552
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,820
windows rubber bands now and then I can

553
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,279
execute any tool that you normally

554
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,340
execute to do forensic investigation so

555
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,169
I will go back to the slides

556
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,220
so this is the disk mapping in axis

557
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,260
demonstration so once you mount the fan

558
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,419
system you can use all the tools that

559
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,269
you have that your test tool box so we

560
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:32,610
can use low key or distract or lock the

561
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,860
timeline or the plus rule you can serve

562
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,460
with us Python script you can do

563
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,649
whatever you want so for example I will

564
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:45,149
show you how to use 30 X Factor because

565
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:46,080
it's an easy one

566
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:54,899
let's run it a few seconds to complete

567
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,590
commands

568
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,879
[Music]

569
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,310
the British water is running so if

570
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,140
you're doing the job I will keep it

571
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,590
running the few seconds so everything is

572
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,920
running remotely on the the machine and

573
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,470
which is nice because for example if the

574
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,720
machine is a very powerful server and

575
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
the lives is booted you will have all

576
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,530
the resources of this very powerful

577
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,410
server so you don't need extra CPU extra

578
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,050
memory and so on you have the public

579
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,570
resources provided by the O's I stopped

580
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,240
this and you see that it can be work I

581
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,400
have already corrected interesting

582
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,700
informations domain she is on fire she

583
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,120
begged off winpe carved with years

584
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,180
winning and so you have access to all

585
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,630
the tools that you normally use doing

586
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:21,800
your investigations you can of course

587
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,980
use the disk analysis tool so that's the

588
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,570
one that I like to think so the big

589
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,650
extract loci and so on but sometimes

590
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,930
it's very interesting to work on the

591
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,360
life file system on a live system it's

592
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,370
easy because if the system has been

593
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,590
compromised maybe you would like to

594
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,580
extract some some payload to see the

595
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,520
network activity you would like to to

596
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,130
fetch them from malware you would like

597
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,700
to extract stuff from the registries but

598
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,280
again evidence must be preserved so no

599
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,350
the next demo I will show you how we can

600
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,710
boot the compromised system using human

601
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,840
and always without changing any bits on

602
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,640
the fan system so the bones to prisoner

603
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,980
the evidences so to do this we have to

604
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,500
do we have to perform two steps the

605
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,409
first one we create a snapshot of the

606
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,080
disk and then we will boot at the end

607
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,810
using the snapshot as main storage so it

608
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,429
means that the operating system will

609
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,500
have a snapshot to write store because

610
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,630
when you boot invest it writes a lot of

611
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,750
stuff which will present any change on

612
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,070
the original file system so to do this I

613
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,790
have to unlock my existing list because

614
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,770
I need to map the complete

615
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,120
Disko frozen so i will burn up this and

616
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,659
no i will map or XO mounted

617
00:34:51,550 --> 00:35:01,250
i know i will map again but in this case

618
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,260
i will not be complete this can we map

619
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,440
it became evident so how to do this the

620
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,700
first step is to to create my my

621
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,130
snapshot and to do this Q is very

622
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,640
powerful

623
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,230
to see that it's very pretty

624
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,290
so in a few seconds Q&U created on my

625
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,390
where is it

626
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,900
would you see that I have my snapshot

627
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,150
which is very small because it does not

628
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,580
contain anything right now but I will

629
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,490
know boot the system so remember that it

630
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,930
was a Windows 7 system

631
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,050
I will boot it in a queue in a virtual

632
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,350
machine and I will use this snapshot so

633
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,170
it's very long so you have to strip

634
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,220
everything because it's a very very long

635
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,780
command like this copy so trust me

636
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,960
that's the command that were to die and

637
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,190
what I we do at the same time I will

638
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,540
check the I need to mark - my gene

639
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:41,390
support so what I will do this I need to

640
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,730
map the path to open the console

641
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:16,240
so cute stop it and now I can launch DNC

642
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,860
you were

643

[Music]

644
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,880
there we go

645
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,060
that's way he thinks my my team is not

646
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,720
very powerful so here we go so my

647
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,270
Windows system is starting so it means a

648
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,350
on my life CD in my daughter I started a

649
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,070
queue

650
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,070
starting the virtual machine and the

651
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,940
electronics everything is running in

652
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,570
memory and I'm using the snapshot that I

653
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,750
created to boot the system so I don't I

654
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,960
don't I do not utter anything on the

655
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,090
original first time and my system will

656
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,740
boot on you you can don't perform all

657
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,060
the investigation that you would like to

658
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,390
like using the specific windows only

659
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,030
tool checking for some evidences in a

660
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,330
specific file for example if the the

661
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,460
first system is encrypted you should be

662
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,260
able to ask the user to type a password

663
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,570
for you so you don't know to have the

664
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,910
password but if decrypt the the

665
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,340
BitLocker volume and stuff like this so

666
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,220
the VM is just running I will keep the

667
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,270
VM booting it goes it takes a few

668
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:48,480
minutes it's quite slow ok so it's

669
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,520
that's working with a live a live system

670
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,690
the next step of course is to take

671
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,730
memory analysis so guess what we are

672
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,160
using qmu so we have were using a

673
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,620
virtual system so it's quite very easy

674
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,250
to perform a memory acquisition on the

675
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,580
qmu system it's only one command and if

676
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,240
the memory is very big like 32 gigabits

677
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,580
or even 64 even more on a server

678
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:25,050
everything will be located in memory the

679
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,900
Bisco server when I say in memory this

680
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,450
is mine so if you start to do a lot of

681
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,730
investigation and you start to create a

682
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,890
lot of files as everything running in

683
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,870
memory it would be very interesting to

684
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,780
have a very big VM with a lot of me more

685
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,360
memory than the the server that you have

686
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,240
to investigate of course is it starting

687
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,410
Windows I will continue to do because I

688
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,970
would like to take the memory image then

689
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,300
something slowly slowly

690
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,060
it's a VMI's to Smallville MVM with only

691
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,030
one CPU so can you imagine us get

692
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,370
recession on top of docker on top of the

693
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,000
lysine year

694
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,160
let's take let's try to get the memory

695
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,490
damn even if the device is not completed

696
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,620
me normally we should already have some

697
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,580
processes running

698
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:40,900
okay dawn and no in /tmp you have the so

699
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,089
it's a 1 gigabyte file so I have my term

700
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:45,279
so now I can try to do some volatility

701
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:48,819
stuff let's try to find the kiddies can

702
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:59,890
do the DVD DVD scan so again my goal

703
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,210
here is not to explain you how to use

704
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,979
volatility what kind of artifacts you

705
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,599
can extract from the memory image but

706
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,430
the goal is to demonstrate you how you

707
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,680
can remotely have access to the memory

708
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,739
them to the disk to boot the VM remotely

709
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,079
to have access to through VNC and so on

710
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,759
and you will be able to use your

711
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:18,309
practice time like if you were directly

712
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:30,039
connected on it its volatility run so

713
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:32,170
that's the the five demo so the the

714
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,069
memory acquisition what you can do so if

715
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:38,369
you need more tools so for example

716
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:42,069
sometimes you need some tools that you

717
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:45,849
did not prepare by default for example

718
00:42:45,849 --> 00:42:47,559
I'm a big fan of the sysinternals tools

719
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,650
from Microsoft usually what I do to

720
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,430
sysinternals

721
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,200
are pre-installed so I refresh and

722
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,390
install to my live CD but the

723
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,950
sysinternals tools are not installed on

724
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,650
the windows that you were to investigate

725
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,630
in this case I will not do the demo

726
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,690
because I'm running late but you can

727
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,880
also use QA move so how does it work

728
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,979
basically you can start a Samba server

729
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:18,819
on the live CD and when you boot the the

730
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:21,640
QE when you boot the machine you specify

731
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,219
that a new SMB share has to be connected

732
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,569
to the machine because there is an

733
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,999
internal network which is ready to

734
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,519
communicate between the live CD and the

735
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,319
machine so you can also exchange files

736
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,660
copy stuff and then you complete the

737
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,489
files on the Mon territory and they will

738
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,560
be automatically

739
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,560
on the on the way from the life on the

740
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,760
line it's coming up but basically I

741
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,830
would just show you the on the demo like

742
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,900
this so what you do if you do this

743
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,850
command I will try to zoom I don't know

744
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,250
if I can zoom takes it though can i zoom

745
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:05,100
let's try like this so I cannot do so

746
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,300
basically you specify raise it that you

747
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,130
have SMB server which is running on 1000

748
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,780
- 4 and you use these files of the

749
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,280
network that we like to use for the file

750
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,790
system for the network sorry between the

751
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,520
live CD and the Windows machine and you

752
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,950
will have SMB share directly connected

753
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,020
on the machine and will be able to

754
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,020
investigate and to copy tools to deploy

755
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,530
them and take also to copy files between

756
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:45,120
the SMB share and do Window System other

757
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,110
features that are also interesting so as

758
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,270
I said communication is key the live CD

759
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,850
is able to communicate with a specific

760
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:59,430
IRC server which is private and I've

761
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,170
owned all the communication occur

762
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,170
through the VPN so the customer and the

763
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,810
the expert the owner understand can

764
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,030
exchange useful information during the

765
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:13,530
investigation another interesting

766
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,550
feature I think I think I don't remember

767
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:23,760
when Peter from method told so Peter

768
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,590
yesterday talked about Cisco Kenji but

769
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,810
he was so responsible for the projects

770
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,060
we do and she do was a nice feature when

771
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,860
you can also work like you know like

772
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,680
during the the nuclear weapons launch

773
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,410
you can has to approve some comments so

774
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,780
you need to have two people turning the

775
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,970
key at the same time the same feature is

776
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,010
available in bits code so it means that

777
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,340
for some specific commands you you can

778
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,440
ask

779
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,940
approval to the

780
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:57,300
customer specific comments yes yeah we

781
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:04,760
have sorry okay can we finish very

782
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,200
sensitive comments approval it's it's

783
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,300
another one and I think it's my last

784
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,050
slide

785
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,730
yeah you can of course use data to

786
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,920
Australia to to do everything you want

787
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,680
so you can map all the polls and you can

788
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,050
download for example you can download

789
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,750
the memory you cannot always all make a

790
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,170
copy and download to the local system

791
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,329
the memory image the disk image if you

792
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,310
want you can also download through proxy

793
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,770
what I do usually so you don't need to

794
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,910
use the identity of the customer and

795
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,589
yeah that's my finished so most

796
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,230
important bits code it's developed and

797
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,589
maintained by vitaliy I'm not the owner

798
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:46,829
of this pool I'm just a contributor to

799
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:48,810
the project so I mean that I submitted

800
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,640
some changes that have been incorporated

801
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,540
in the github repository but I really

802
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,710
like to do I use it I use the tool for

803
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,680
projects and for investigations and I

804
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,440
was real happy to share this with you so

805
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,650
it's finished for me so if you have

806
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,319
question we are running out of time but

807
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,730
if you have comments if you have

808
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,160
questions I will remain on the IRC

809
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,380
Channel I will be on Twitter so feel

810
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,569
free to contact me and I will be happy

811
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,040
to answer all your questions thank you

812
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,339
very much and sorry for the small glitch

813
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:29,190
during the demo but I switched I booted

814
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,500
the wrong the wrong image probably and

815
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,810
because I'm building a new one so it's

816
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:42,900
always like I just have a question can

817
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:51,780
you deal with super red this demo was a

818
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,150
little bit out of scope because the goal

819
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,560
was we to present the tool with the

820
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,650
basic features but you can queue a meal

821
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,840
for example you can boot it

822
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,950
in some kind of single user most it mean

823
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,480
that when you boot them it can be

824
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,820
suspended and then you can attach from

825
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,300
debuggers you can do a lot of stuff and

826
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,550
high F material to explain you how to

827
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,340
decrypt a bit rocker key what's nice

828
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,200
because if you can put the VM you saw

829
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,810
that you put the VM and you can interact

830
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,690
live with the VM if your customer has

831
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,020
the BitLocker key it will just input the

832
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,700
key for you so you don't know - you

833
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,480
don't know - no the key but if the

834
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,280
system is completely locked and you

835
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,960
don't know the key and you have to find

836
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,880
the key back there is a procedure to

837
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,220
find the basically you knew it the

838
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,690
classic procedure to recover the

839
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:53,160
BitLocker key from memory yeah thank you

840
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,510
it's the progression of the likes to

841
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,460
beam it's quite some time yes automated

842
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,240
scripts now that were automatically did

843
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,280
the first time that you generate your

844
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,920
image there is a script and it will ask

845
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,020
you some questions what's the IP address

846
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,370
of your VPN server

847
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,890
what's your CH so base is very very

848
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,850
basic stuff but personally I made a lot

849
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,400
of changes manually because I won't I

850
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,810
really would like to have my own

851
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:30,100
customized live CD but yes if you have a

852
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,350
simple a simple setup you know if you

853
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,230
open VPN server already available you

854
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:38,320
can you can prepare your own life she be

855
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,300
in a few minutes yes if you don't

856
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,020
customize it yes ok thanks a lot for

857
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,970
your speech my pleasure thanks so our

858
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,300
next speaker is from reddit Sam I'm

859
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,330
going to expose some tools in order to

860
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:03,630
alanine vaporization process and provide

861
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,680
hello everybody I suppose you can hear

862
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,650
me ok so yeah my name is axel simon I'm

863
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,720
part of the Red Hat office of the CTO

864
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,820
and today I'd like to tell you

865
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,340
about integrity and confidentiality in

866
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,430
computing and specifically a project

867
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,900
we've been working on which is called an

868
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:28,270
arcs so I'll share my screen and here we

869
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,480
go let me know if everything is good for

870
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,630
you

871
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,220
all right

872
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,740
is all good so yes security thank you

873
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,320
very much thanks for confirming by the

874
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,330
way I might skip a few things but don't

875
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,440
hesitate to come and ask as many

876
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,060
questions as you want afterwards we are

877
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,410
we are an open source project and we are

878
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,510
very happy to have as many questions

879
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,130
people join and everything I'll go more

880
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,050
say more about that at the end but uh

881
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,430
but yeah anyway so what's the problem we

882
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,980
are looking at well

883
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,619
lots lots of lots of people need

884
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:09,690
integrity and confidentiality in their

885
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,210
processes in their data I mean this is a

886
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,890
security conference I'm sure I'm not

887
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,590
teaching anybody anything new here but

888
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,020
these are a few places and sectors where

889
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,490
people really have a strong need for

890
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,440
confidentiality integrity you've got

891
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,380
personal data you've got health data

892
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,050
banking in finance human rights NGOs we

893
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,369
don't often think about them but they

894
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:31,349
often they also need a lot of they have

895
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:32,550
a lot of sensitive data they need to

896
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,430
protect and for instance one of the

897
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,080
simple examples we like to give but you

898
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,480
know you don't necessarily want your

899
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,820
sister diamond to be able to see the

900
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,550
payroll information of your CEO if it's

901
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,320
not public you know there's a lot of

902
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,609
does a lot of cases it's basically

903
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:49,440
everybody needs to be able to protect

904
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,869
data and to be able to protect the way

905
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:55,410
data is managed and accessed but

906
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,510
currently if you look at what a typical

907
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,910
virtualizes virtualization state

908
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,849
virtualization stack looks like in a

909
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:05,190
cloud setting it looks something like

910
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,790
this

911
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,520
each color here is a different vendor a

912
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,380
different trust domain as we will be

913
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,930
calling them basically a different set a

914
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,240
different entity you need to trust so

915
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,589
your application at the top

916
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:17,730
maybe you've written doubt yourself

917
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,900
maybe it comes from a trusted third

918
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,089
party you know a free and open source

919
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:24,210
project you voted at the code but all

920
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,849
the steps oldest the parts below in the

921
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:28,560
stack will be someone else and you have

922
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,260
to trust these these these vendors to be

923
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,900
able to have a fully trust able stack it

924
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,910
gets very hard because you have someone

925
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,050
different for the firmware someone

926
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,030
different billing your BIOS someone

927
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,859
different building the CPU and if any of

928
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,710
these is compromised well basically you

929
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,680
can't really trust your stack anymore

930
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,440
if you look at a container stack it's

931
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,700
even worse arguably

932
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,460
because we have more places where there

933
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,530
is a very new person to trust or a new

934
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,349
entity to trust your middleware in your

935
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,990
user space will be one vendor your

936
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,250
container engine your kernel your

937
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,020
bootloader usually someone else you have

938
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,760
maybe even a hypervisor to in a cloud

939
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,490
setting so all these layers are that you

940
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,190
need to trust again same problem lots of

941
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,690
different trust relationships if any one

942
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,430
of them breaks down then you can't

943
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,320
really trust what's going on any of

944
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,270
these could compromise your stack and

945
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,880
basically compromise your the data or

946
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,349
the processes you're trying to protect

947
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:26,770
so not not very nice and one way of

948
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,770
looking at it is this xkcd comic that

949
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,480
many of us have seen it now if you've

950
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,950
seen it better we find it very good we

951
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,010
like it okay so maybe reality is not as

952
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,430
bad as this but is you know it gives a

953
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,690
good idea of what's going on and and

954
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,070
this is the problem we have right now I

955
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,750
think honestly that this is a problem

956
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,609
that so many of us find so hard that

957
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:47,050
we've just sort of accepted it and we've

958
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,150
just almost put it a bit aside saying

959
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,310
well you know you can't guarantee oldest

960
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,050
that old of hold up parts of the stack

961
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:56,440
so just let's do our best but actually

962
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,730
there is something we can use these days

963
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,369
and that thing is trusted execution

964
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:04,480
environments so what what do they do T's

965
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,470
and we'll define what they are

966
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,960
afterwards but what do they do so T's

967
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,180
trusted execution environments they

968
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,210
enable you to create an area where you

969
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,589
can put an application and it's

970
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,630
middleware for instance and to protect

971
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,000
that and and how is it protected well

972
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,780
the CPU creates that protected area and

973
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,819
only the CPU has access to that

974
00:54:24,819 --> 00:54:27,220
protected area where you're executing

975
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,280
things so what happens if any of the

976
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,740
other layers try to access this this

977
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,510
this protected area well they get

978
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,470
blocked they get blocked by the CPU and

979
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,240
basically all the other layers don't

980
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,160
have their say in what is happening so

981
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,329
you end up with a stack which is

982
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:45,220
basically your application it's

983
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,470
middleware and the CPU those are the

984
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,470
only things you really have to trust of

985
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,940
course you still have to trust them and

986
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,280
that's a big part but you know we've

987
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,099
we've reduced we've reduced from and let

988
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:58,630
me go back on this for a second um you

989
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,010
know nothing's perfect here but we've

990
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,890
we've reduced from from having to trust

991
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,599
all these layers to only having trust a

992
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:05,220
few late

993
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,540
which is better so looking at tea is a

994
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,430
different way it creates a protected

995
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,290
area within the host where you can

996
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,470
execute sensitive workloads and what

997
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,240
does it provide well memory

998
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,630
confidentiality that is the memory in

999
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,000
which these are these workloads is

1000
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,800
loaded it's protected that's done

1001
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,560
through using cryptography so the CPU

1002
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,540
will actually encrypt those pages of

1003
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,480
memory and will make them unreadable to

1004
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,400
any other thing on the any other process

1005
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,880
on the on the host it also provides

1006
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,190
integrity protection so that means we

1007
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,330
can be sure that nothing is being

1008
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,609
changed in these in this area of memory

1009
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:46,500
without our knowledge we can guarantee

1010
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,690
that the the range of memory is is

1011
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:51,359
integrity its integrity is protected it

1012
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,950
also offers something else that is very

1013
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,170
interesting for us the capacity for

1014
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,300
general compute so this is where there

1015
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,030
is a real difference with a TPM for

1016
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,160
instance a TPM does not enable you to

1017
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,260
run anything you want it's quite limited

1018
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,910
in what it will what it will compute

1019
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,340
here with T's we haven't actually a

1020
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,369
general compute capacity and they often

1021
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:14,520
they also offer a hardware a random

1022
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,960
number generator which is very useful

1023
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,780
for setting up proper cryptography and

1024
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,970
you know securing and creating keys and

1025
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,869
such so all of these are very useful and

1026
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:26,160
but the first question you might ask if

1027
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,570
you're thinking of using these is or

1028
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,700
wait a second how can I be sure that

1029
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,859
this thing on this computer that claims

1030
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:35,040
to be a T it really is a T it could be a

1031
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,080
rogue process pretending to be a T and

1032
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,510
going to accept your your your workloads

1033
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,609
that actually you know not offering any

1034
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,890
protection so the right way to do this

1035
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,740
and what T's offer is an attestation

1036
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,650
process where you can as a tenant as a

1037
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,960
third party well second party you can

1038
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,109
check that the the T is a real valid

1039
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:58,619
genuine T and not an imitation this is

1040
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,660
done through difficult and public key

1041
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,330
exchange and it's based on the hardware

1042
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,540
root of trust that is the CPU itself so

1043
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,760
yes this means you have to trust the CPU

1044
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,740
it's a choice you make it's a choice we

1045
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,640
make obviously it has limits but for the

1046
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,960
time being we think you know this is

1047
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,339
this is this is very good improvement

1048
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:18,580
this is worth it so

1049
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,400
what you do is you get attestation that

1050
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,590
the tea is a valid tea

1051
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,480
by the way this attestation can also be

1052
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,210
provided to third parties if you need to

1053
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,270
that's another interesting aspect of it

1054
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:33,340
and then you you measure that everything

1055
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,530
is okay and you can then start loading

1056
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:40,290
your your workload in their teas come in

1057
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,870
two major models so one of them is what

1058
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,430
we call the process based one which is

1059
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,220
uses the the process as a boundary and

1060
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,250
that's what you will find in Intel SGX

1061
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,140
which is not currently entirely in the

1062
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,390
upstream linux kernel but work is still

1063
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,160
underway and it's also something that

1064
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,840
exists in an in risk five it is a

1065
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,190
project worker being worked on called

1066
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,440
sanctum there's no actual hardware yet

1067
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,620
but that's another another te model

1068
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,140
which is based on processes on the on

1069
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,160
the other side we have vm based teas so

1070
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,180
we'll find this in AMD's SCB in ibm's PF

1071
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,920
which also doesn't have hardware yet and

1072
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,740
intel is working on something so in the

1073
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,630
vm case we'll go back in to in a sec

1074
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,190
that you use as you may have guessed a

1075
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,820
vm as the fundamental working book

1076
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,650
note that for our purposes we're not

1077
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,550
defining trust owns from arm as a te for

1078
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,050
a bunch of reasons i don't have time now

1079
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,220
but if you're interested in that we can

1080
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,660
always come and chat with us we'll go

1081
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,690
more into it so quickly going we don't

1082
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,470
have that much time so I'll go quickly

1083
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,680
on these some of the pros and cons from

1084
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,530
the from the process based version so

1085
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,050
you get system access to system API

1086
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,120
sfrom keeps the Keats's the name we give

1087
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,270
to two T's that we are using in an arc

1088
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:01,690
stuti instances the cons is well you

1089
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,880
can't filter those api's and basically

1090
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,430
them based the major one is the

1091
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,230
secretary the security boundary is

1092
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,880
rather untested it's a new one it

1093
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,870
doesn't have years and years of research

1094
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:14,500
behind and that is that is a thing to

1095
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,810
bear in mind on the virtual machine side

1096
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,750
well on the other hand the existing

1097
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,520
boundary the VM is well known and we've

1098
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,320
been using that for security for years

1099
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,350
and years now and you can essentially

1100
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,330
run your application on existing stacks

1101
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,680
there's there's other pros as you can

1102
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,380
see quickly going quickly

1103
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,450
in the Khans same as the previous time

1104
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,739
you are sort of locked into the

1105
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,299
architecture because it's very specific

1106
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:40,989
to the silicon in in question you get

1107
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:42,700
some hardware emulation and it is a bit

1108
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,680
have you wait for micro services if

1109
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,809
you're just looking to run you know

1110
00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:48,880
really small small services and micro

1111
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,930
services type so knowing that we have

1112
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,910
these different teas and and that they

1113
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:55,989
exist and that they're out there right

1114
00:59:55,989 --> 00:59:58,509
now what can we do how do we use them

1115
00:59:58,509 --> 01:00:00,309
well this is this is where nrx comes in

1116
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:01,630
and this is what we're trying to do with

1117
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,549
our I know I'll explain a bit more the

1118
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:06,759
point of the enoch's project so let's

1119
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:09,819
start with a simple five five point over

1120
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:12,849
view so as you as I've just said nrx

1121
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:17,049
uses tes currently SGX nacd to enable

1122
01:00:17,049 --> 01:00:19,839
you to run confidential workloads one of

1123
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,180
the other big goals is easy development

1124
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,069
and deployment and for that we used

1125
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:25,869
wisdom which is webassembly

1126
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,849
I'll come back to webassembly in the

1127
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:30,640
future in a few minutes but um this is a

1128
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,680
this is another big part of n arcs we

1129
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,599
want it to be easy to use really really

1130
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:38,200
important also we have strong security

1131
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,900
there's design principles and by that I

1132
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,960
mean we will try every time we can to

1133
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,299
make the decision to go for the most

1134
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:48,190
secure way of doing things and to

1135
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,469
prevent users from making bad security

1136
01:00:50,469 --> 01:00:51,969
decisions we want to give of course

1137
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:54,309
users the freedom to make choices but as

1138
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:56,019
much as we can we are going to make sure

1139
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,930
that you are by default making the right

1140
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,269
choices and one of the ways we also do

1141
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:03,369
that is we use rust which has the same

1142
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:05,559
ideas so it sort of goes together very

1143
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:09,910
much cloud native as you can see we have

1144
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:12,130
a goal to support openshift and

1145
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,499
kubernetes in general so we want to make

1146
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:16,059
sure that integrates nicely with cloud

1147
01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:18,489
in our environments it's it's a big part

1148
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:21,460
of you know computing these days and of

1149
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,339
course of course this is a free and open

1150
01:01:24,339 --> 01:01:26,289
source conference and Red Hat is a free

1151
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:28,180
and open source company so of course nr

1152
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,289
is a free and open source project I I

1153
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,660
will insist on project we're not a

1154
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,670
product it's not production ready yet

1155
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:40,410
but it hopefully will be in the future

1156
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,729
and as an open source project it was

1157
01:01:42,729 --> 01:01:45,009
donated to the confidential computing

1158
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:46,150
could sauce him so

1159
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,460
while it was started by Red Hat it's not

1160
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,079
just a Red Hat project it really is an

1161
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,019
open-source project and it right now is

1162
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:54,999
hosted by the confidential computing

1163
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:58,059
consortium which is a new which is a new

1164
01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:00,130
organization that is uh hosted by the

1165
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,619
Linux Foundation and as you can guess by

1166
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,749
the name it is dedicated to furthering

1167
01:02:04,749 --> 01:02:07,089
confidential computing at large and it

1168
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:09,630
has hardware vendors software vendors

1169
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,460
blockchain companies software companies

1170
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,099
so you know it's quite quite varied it's

1171
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:18,069
a good place for that so what are we

1172
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:19,630
trying to do what's the goal within arc

1173
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,960
so this is this is basically the goal

1174
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,029
the the point here is that we want you

1175
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:27,880
as a client so on the right side to be

1176
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,839
able to attest that the tea on the host

1177
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,789
that you are about to put your workload

1178
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:35,890
down is a genuine one with the

1179
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:38,470
attestation handshake get an answer that

1180
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,539
shows you that this hasn't been the case

1181
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:41,710
that you you know you can check that

1182
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:45,390
this is correct and then reusing the

1183
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,680
encrypted channel you create during that

1184
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,400
initial handshake upload send your your

1185
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,079
workload and relies inside an

1186
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:55,869
environment but with great ease so you

1187
01:02:55,869 --> 01:02:57,819
know we want we want this to all be as

1188
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:58,720
simple as possible

1189
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,609
I currently there are several projects

1190
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:03,640
out there that try and use teas um but

1191
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,470
usually attestation is is something that

1192
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:06,940
you love to do on your own and we think

1193
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,039
it's a really important part if you

1194
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,150
can't check that you're running on a

1195
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:13,359
real te then it's all it there are real

1196
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,489
issues there

1197
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:17,170
so yeah the idea is this to make this

1198
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:19,390
simple so looking a bit more in details

1199
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:22,239
how we do this I'd like to call your

1200
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:23,950
attention to the two middle layers the

1201
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,440
blue window and the green one was the in

1202
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,230
webassembly so we want to make sure that

1203
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,539
you can basically run a you are out you

1204
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:33,069
can compile your application to web

1205
01:03:33,069 --> 01:03:36,460
assembly and that that runs no matter

1206
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,950
where what T is underneath if it's a

1207
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,539
process based keep one on the Left if

1208
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:43,869
it's a VM based keep on the right we

1209
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:45,640
want you to be able to write your

1210
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,220
application compile it once to

1211
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,700
webassembly and run it on on a T

1212
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,950
whatever the TE is and so webassembly

1213
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:55,569
here is a very interesting and important

1214
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:58,239
part web assembly for those who might

1215
01:03:58,239 --> 01:03:59,860
not know is

1216
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,210
something that came out at the browser

1217
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:04,120
world and it attempts to do JavaScript

1218
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,950
done right that's one way people have

1219
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:09,070
described it essentially provide a fast

1220
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:15,250
and and a a fast binary you can't really

1221
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,040
find my words here sorry

1222
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,120
essentially it provides a target to

1223
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,370
which you can compile many languages and

1224
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,810
that will run the same everywhere it's

1225
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,660
again this idea of you know write once

1226
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,120
run anywhere but in this case it seems

1227
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,730
to be really working out well you can

1228
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,830
write your code in almost any language

1229
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:33,250
you want

1230
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,720
I mean it's you can go from pearl to

1231
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,210
Python C++ C sharp you know

1232
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:40,180
rust basically almost many many

1233
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,940
languages can compile to a web assembly

1234
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,700
target and that means you don't have to

1235
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,830
change how you're writing what language

1236
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,690
you like to use your tools you can keep

1237
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,070
using all the same all the ones you're

1238
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,900
using but you can just compile to web

1239
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,630
assembly and then we will and I take

1240
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,770
this webassembly a binary and runs it on

1241
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,320
on the T we're using huazi as the layer

1242
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,630
above Razia's web assembly system

1243
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:07,450
interface it's a way of taking web

1244
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,980
assembly out of the browser's and making

1245
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,080
it work in server space by adding the

1246
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,700
necessary layers that you need there to

1247
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,770
access for instance things like file

1248
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:17,260
systems and such so using those two

1249
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,910
layers that that's that's the N arcs

1250
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,490
architecture they Docs plan I would like

1251
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,020
to show you right now is it's where we

1252
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,110
are for these two technologies for SGX

1253
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,760
and SCP is just one where we're working

1254
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,880
on now so I'm gonna do a quick demo and

1255
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,380
hopefully the video will work fine

1256
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,370
through this through the presentation so

1257
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,860
so what we have now is we have these

1258
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,300
layers we have the application and we

1259
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,200
have the SGX T so we're skipping the

1260
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,140
other layers and this is how it this is

1261
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,820
how it happens let me full-screen this

1262
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:52,360
right so I'm gonna show you the source

1263
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,840
code so first of all we have the source

1264
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,160
code to this application we're gonna run

1265
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,230
very simple source code basically just

1266
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,480
print a line of text good morning that's

1267
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,200
nice number we compile it to a static PI

1268
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,410
binary and let's check that it has

1269
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,630
compiled properly yep okay we've got a

1270
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,460
compiled binary and now we're going to

1271
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:13,390
run it

1272
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:17,830
on SGX and wait a sec there it is so

1273
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:18,700
that's its run

1274
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,930
good morning that's a nice - net number

1275
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,600
so you can see simple source code it

1276
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,630
gets run on the on SGX that's that's

1277
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,020
quite cool we're quite happy with that

1278
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,670
now let's do the same thing with sed so

1279
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:33,040
just as a reminder sed is a completely

1280
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,660
different technology doesn't use at all

1281
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,580
the same principle not process but vm

1282
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,610
based um a different silicon different

1283
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:42,010
architecture basically so again we'll

1284
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,270
take our application and we're going to

1285
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:46,900
try and write on a CD and let's look at

1286
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,500
the video demo so same thing let's check

1287
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,270
out their source code as you can see

1288
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,180
it's the same source code we're going to

1289
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:59,730
compile it alright

1290
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:01,560
there it is it's compiled let's go we're

1291
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,000
gonna check now that it has compiled

1292
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,609
properly here we go

1293
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:07,470
same thing it's compiled properly okay

1294
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,880
no problem and now we're going to run it

1295
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,510
this time on an SCV keep I'm sorry NSE V

1296
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,780
T and yeah okay it has run you can see

1297
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,800
good morning that's a nice - that's

1298
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,780
embarassing thing same output great very

1299
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,190
happy with that

1300
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,380
look the rest of the code is debug code

1301
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,020
we haven't picking it out right now this

1302
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,420
is still working progress obviously but

1303
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,359
you can see same output on both sides so

1304
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,010
that's that's that's really cool so

1305
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,869
we're currently capable of running code

1306
01:07:33,869 --> 01:07:39,270
on a on an SG XT and unless you VT so

1307
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:43,010
that's that's nice it's nice but um

1308
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,000
currently what we've been doing is we've

1309
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,220
been compiling and we've had to compile

1310
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,589
again what we'd really want to do is

1311
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:51,780
stable to compile once and run the same

1312
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,020
binary on both but actually that's

1313
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,000
literally just what we did that's what I

1314
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
just showed you this was the same exact

1315
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,510
binary compiled once and an executor on

1316
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,150
both sides on both different teas so

1317
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,250
again this is like really different te

1318
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,650
architectures so this is a capture of

1319
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:13,650
the two terminal puts I just showed you

1320
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:15,780
you can see the differences s3x on one

1321
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,009
side in the CB on the other side but

1322
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,319
also some of you may have realized this

1323
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,859
it's the same hash so it's literally

1324
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,149
exactly the same binary I know I'm

1325
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:25,529
repeating myself but this is this is

1326
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:27,799
really quite an exciting moment for us

1327
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,149
we've got one binary running on two

1328
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:32,130
completely different hardware

1329
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,620
architectures so this is really nice

1330
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,770
this is really cool obviously we're not

1331
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,049
at the full picture yet as you can see

1332
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,729
here this is another version of looking

1333
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:44,880
at the whole picture of n arcs we we

1334
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,460
haven't done the walls Ian was in bits

1335
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,880
but what we have done is the layers

1336
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,069
around so our application is running via

1337
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:57,719
shim and a loader and the kernel on on a

1338
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:00,810
CPU on an Intel CPU in the SGX trusted

1339
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:04,170
execution environment you can see so n

1340
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:06,660
arcs the NX layers are included shim and

1341
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,339
a loader so that means we've had to

1342
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:10,049
write this specific code to be able to

1343
01:09:10,049 --> 01:09:13,290
load in the process based trusted

1344
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,019
execution

1345
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:18,399
on the on the Intel CPUs if you look at

1346
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,599
the VM side the puppy for VM based keys

1347
01:09:22,599 --> 01:09:24,788
you can see the same general

1348
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:26,078
architecture except that in this case

1349
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,319
the with the shim is followed by a

1350
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:30,908
loader which is at this time a virtual

1351
01:09:30,908 --> 01:09:32,769
machine manager so because it's a

1352
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:33,788
different architecture so this is

1353
01:09:33,788 --> 01:09:35,049
completely different different code

1354
01:09:35,049 --> 01:09:36,759
we've had to write entirely different

1355
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:38,339
code for the load or on different sides

1356
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:40,658
but we still we still get the same

1357
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:44,019
result so so this is where we are right

1358
01:09:44,019 --> 01:09:45,729
now

1359
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:48,698
enough Sadek PI binary running on two

1360
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:51,729
different architectures with the using

1361
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,999
using arm our code the goal of course is

1362
01:09:54,999 --> 01:09:56,050
very work this is where we want to be

1363
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,969
next is we want to we want this to be a

1364
01:09:57,969 --> 01:09:59,980
wasn't binary so a web assembly binary

1365
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:04,329
that would use the there were layers to

1366
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:06,400
to run the same on both sides so this is

1367
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,769
this is the next step and this will

1368
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:12,070
really make it even more useful where we

1369
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,570
are now makes it already possible for

1370
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:14,800
people to start playing with our narcs

1371
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,780
and and this is really something that's

1372
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,639
very open very important to us and I

1373
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:20,320
really want to invite everybody to join

1374
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,199
if you're interested one of the core

1375
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,150
things about our nrx is that we are an

1376
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:28,119
open source project really we try and do

1377
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:29,710
everything as transparently and as

1378
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:32,880
openly as possible as possible obviously

1379
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,320
among other things for security reasons

1380
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,050
because security to transparency is the

1381
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,420
only real way of doing this but also

1382
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,489
because we just it's just a great way of

1383
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,110
doing things and we really enjoy working

1384
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:46,090
with you know new people and having lots

1385
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,550
of people join in and add diversity to

1386
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:50,349
the project it's been it's it's been a

1387
01:10:50,349 --> 01:10:52,539
really great way of having you know new

1388
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,340
contributions and new ways of looking at

1389
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,159
things so yeah everything is open you

1390
01:10:57,159 --> 01:10:59,920
can see here code wiki design issues is

1391
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,050
all on github we have a chat on rocket

1392
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,849
chat which will I'll put a link on the

1393
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:07,059
next page and we welcome you we have C

1394
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,159
ICD resources that's running on package

1395
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:11,559
IO because we need specific hardware we

1396
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,059
have daily stand-ups open to all

1397
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:15,639
anybody's welcome to join and and we use

1398
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:18,159
the code of conduct the contributor

1399
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:19,329
covenant to make sure that you know

1400
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:21,400
everybody plays nicely because we all

1401
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,409
want to work together and have you know

1402
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:25,619
a nice time so

1403
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,139
yes join us if you're interested by all

1404
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:30,599
means the website is an article I oh

1405
01:11:30,599 --> 01:11:32,940
it's gonna change the Knox Devon in your

1406
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,820
future but this it will work anyway

1407
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,420
the code is on github the chat is I

1408
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,739
thought it was on this slide it should

1409
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:43,500
mean it's chat in Ark store I owe

1410
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,840
everything is licensed on the Apache 2

1411
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,790
license almost everything is written in

1412
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:50,010
rust except for some parts that were

1413
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,690
written an actual assembly for the

1414
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:55,440
loader and yeah that's it that's it

1415
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,800
please join us and one more thing as you

1416
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,099
might see here yeah we still have bugs

1417
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:03,690
of course we still have bugs so please

1418
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:05,219
you know come in and join if you want to

1419
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:08,340
if you want to be part of this right I

1420
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,810
hope I wasn't too quick but uh very

1421
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,699
happy to have some questions if there if

1422
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:35,690
you'd like for your presentation so that

1423
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,400
depends on on the tea you're using

1424
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,760
itself Oh currently it's a bit limited

1425
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,199
what you can do because you can't run

1426
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,000
for instance a whole my sequel database

1427
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,090
Finity I think if I'm not mistaken as

1428
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:51,780
Jax has a maximum of is it 128 Meg's of

1429
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,750
memory available at a time and the V

1430
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,730
ends there's something I didn't say

1431
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,409
enough but you shouldn't envision to

1432
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:00,179
vm's as normal vm's like which are going

1433
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:01,500
to be running a whole operating system

1434
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,290
it's more just a virtual CPU with some

1435
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,290
memory pages so right now we're thinking

1436
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,150
about smaller things you're going to be

1437
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,280
running in T's not an entire operating

1438
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,610
system or an entire database that

1439
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:16,050
doesn't really answer your questions

1440
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,580
from what I can tell it's it's a bit

1441
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,380
slower but it's not it's not hugely

1442
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,719
slower so sorry it's not a very precise

1443
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:23,880
answer but this is what I can tell you

1444
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:31,400
right now ok to deploy this solution

1445
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,810
yes I suppose I mean this is a this is

1446
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,370
an open source project so anybody can

1447
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:41,100
use it but beyond that I think it would

1448
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,050
yeah it would make sense I mean this is

1449
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,760
something that we think is going to be

1450
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,680
one of the next steps lots of people are

1451
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,000
going to want to be able to use this

1452
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,010
because what what is interesting here is

1453
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,360
that it protects you on third-party

1454
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,240
clouds like you know cloud vendors but

1455
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,770
also on your own cloud you can't always

1456
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,570
trust this this admins on your own cloud

1457
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,000
and so this this is useful in any cloud

1458
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,490
so yeah we expect to see lots of uptake

1459
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,770
if this works out lots of people will be

1460
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,510
interested and we'll try and put it in

1461
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:12,240
the cloud ok thank you another question

1462
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,960
so the next the next presentation I will

1463
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,010
be run five minutes thanks a lot thank

1464
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:22,340
you very much

01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:27,459
[Music]

1471
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:43,000
[Music]

1472
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,000
you

1473
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,729
[Music]

1474
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,010
with them we're going to do our next

1475
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:06,550
presentation so now the speaker is VBI

1476
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:10,900
gamba is going to talk about specific

1477
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,670
security issue in a garage and

1478
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:19,330
environment you can start with it yeah

1479
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:19,780
sure

1480
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:24,250
thank you so can you hear me well box

1481
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:28,900
okay nice I will share my brother this

1482
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,050
one okay so can you see it yeah perfect

1483
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:35,370
thank you okay great so let's go so

1484
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:37,949
indeed as you said that we'll talk about

1485
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:41,170
today security issues related to the

1486
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:45,190
virtualization world first I'm Oliver

1487
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,370
I'm the CEO and co-founder of fates a

1488
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:51,969
French company based in the out I'm a

1489
01:20:51,969 --> 01:20:55,570
former system administrator and Zen user

1490
01:20:55,570 --> 01:21:02,520
since Y now I also created projects

1491
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,400
seven years ago as a web UI to manage a

1492
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,590
sensor which is a physician platform

1493
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:10,690
made by Citrix and two years ago I

1494
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:14,590
decided to fork this platform to make XE

1495
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,600
PNG we'll talk about that later but I

1496
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,120
can tell you that right now exiting G is

1497
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,160
part of the Linux Foundation projects

1498
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,550
and everything is open-source those

1499
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:27,130
slides are available right now on this

1500
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:31,000
link on Bates at a far / yes so if you

1501
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,219
want to get them in the meantime I'm

1502
01:21:33,219 --> 01:21:34,870
doing my talk feel free so you could

1503
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:37,120
click on the links and you know take

1504
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,370
things a bit deeper if you want to learn

1505
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:43,960
stuff so a quick recap on utilization so

1506
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,210
you are probably aware because you are

1507
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:48,760
the kind of public knowing that but it's

1508
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,560
a kind of reminder that virtualization

1509
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,430
is still everywhere because you might

1510
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:58,000
hurt some you know people cxos telling

1511
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,270
that everything is in cloud and it's

1512
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,130
container it's such wet cetera but they

1513
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,219
tend to forget or don't know that the

1514
01:22:06,219 --> 01:22:08,090
vast majority of use cases

1515
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,440
everything is running on top of

1516
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,120
virtualization so you got the hardware

1517
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,670
the releasing platform and then

1518
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,130
everything on top of that so it means

1519
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,680
it's it's kind of a community so it's

1520
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,400
everywhere that's great but it means

1521
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,390
because it's everywhere there are some

1522
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:26,300
responsibilities that we have software

1523
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,360
deters on better ization platforms so

1524
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,200
those new challenges they are related to

1525
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,270
and this is interesting because it makes

1526
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:38,780
sense with the previews presentation you

1527
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,820
know about the whole stack security and

1528
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,410
having all the components in the stack

1529
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:45,700
as we secure or nothing is really secure

1530
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,770
but you have also challenges regarding

1531
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:52,160
CPU security issues and mitigations

1532
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,950
against that and also new use cases that

1533
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,930
are really interesting but also means

1534
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:01,460
you have new challenges in those area so

1535
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,380
regarding the whole stack I think you're

1536
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:08,060
all aware that we are you know going far

1537
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,400
away from the metal because you know

1538
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,970
it's easier to do some stuff by being

1539
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:15,980
you know on the shoulder of the previous

1540
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,840
work that's bazan so we had that

1541
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,030
relation but we cloud then we got

1542
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,160
orchestration that form then containers

1543
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,310
often as I said almost every time

1544
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,960
running on top of its relation then

1545
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,050
continuous tradition and even server

1546
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:33,560
less sale of several s2 developers and

1547
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,020
even their local s which is not a joke I

1548
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,460
can assure you there's some no code

1549
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:40,730
trends solved by some editors so you

1550
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:42,560
don't need you know to understand

1551
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,680
anything to build an application so so

1552
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,150
what's next the thing is we are going

1553
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:49,820
away from the middle and we forgets that

1554
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,730
everything is running on a server in the

1555
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:56,480
end so that's that what matters and the

1556
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,760
other problem in the meantime is the

1557
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:01,220
fact that hardware vendors like you're

1558
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,530
you know server vendors like daily HP or

1559
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:06,530
whatever are increasingly putting

1560
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:08,330
software inside there

1561
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:09,950
you know hardware offer like you know

1562
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:12,650
more firmwares more DN c--'s like you

1563
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:17,180
know I drag or I low so those really

1564
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,930
great things to facilitate the way that

1565
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:21,590
you work

1566
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,110
with your servers but those teams are

1567
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:26,090
you know don't have any security culture

1568
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:28,219
bundling and they have often other

1569
01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:30,560
priorities so it's it's like if you

1570
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,960
wanted to compare like you know the car

1571
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,810
manufacturers they were deeply Hardware

1572
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:39,500
you know vendors doing really big big

1573
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,960
work on physical things but there's more

1574
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,750
and more software in your cars and then

1575
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,429
they don't really have this culture of

1576
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,080
building software so it might cause

1577
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,920
issue and and guess what it did so

1578
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,260
regarding CPUs problems you are very

1579
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,650
aware I suppose about all the recent

1580
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:01,900
Intel but also other people other

1581
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,460
founders like auntie or even on arms I

1582
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,550
think there is gone some I would say at

1583
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:10,099
least small problems regarding branch

1584
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:12,889
prediction and kind of shortcut that you

1585
01:25:12,889 --> 01:25:15,619
can do to have faster CPUs but in the

1586
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:18,830
cost of being able to break layers to

1587
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,630
break security between the two machine

1588
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:23,780
between application so I don't do an

1589
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,699
exhaustive list of all of them but

1590
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,080
there's a link if you want to to go

1591
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,360
deeper it well you know check you TV

1592
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,920
paper so we can learn a bit more about

1593
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:34,310
that but the the main thing to remember

1594
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:38,389
is those problems are really related to

1595
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:41,449
some shortcuts some people did to have

1596
01:25:41,449 --> 01:25:43,190
fast machines and then it breaks

1597
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:46,670
boundaries between you know VMs thread

1598
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:51,530
or programs regarding the IPMI DMC's

1599
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:55,130
Virna BG so again IPM is a chip or even

1600
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:57,080
a small computer directly within your

1601
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,050
server and those chips are really really

1602
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:01,699
great if you want you know to do a

1603
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:03,590
remote hand installation make some

1604
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:06,530
changes into the ufi now virtual devices

1605
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:09,190
update firmware that's repower 'full and

1606
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:12,080
really useful but the problem is when

1607
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,330
this is compromised then it means you

1608
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,969
are completely compromised because there

1609
01:26:16,969 --> 01:26:19,550
are so low level that you can access

1610
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,349
almost everything for them so this is

1611
01:26:21,349 --> 01:26:25,280
also a kind of threats so in that

1612
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,560
context of you know more and more

1613
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:31,280
complexity more features and more low

1614
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,250
level software available it means that

1615
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,090
it's

1616
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:36,830
time when you both the server and you

1617
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,409
put it in the rack and that's it you

1618
01:26:39,409 --> 01:26:41,119
won't touch anything else except you

1619
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:42,800
know the operating system on top of that

1620
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,760
this time ended since we had all those

1621
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,940
issues on Intel CPUs so there's a lot of

1622
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,560
stuff now you need to to update like

1623
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:54,590
microcode firmwares BMC's you might even

1624
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:57,469
you know tinker with the hardware by

1625
01:26:57,469 --> 01:26:59,300
removing for example hyper threading if

1626
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,849
you think it worth it in terms of

1627
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:05,420
security and and the problem is those

1628
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,570
bugs are here to stay by that I mean

1629
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,190
that it won't be solved and I'm pretty

1630
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,290
certain that in the near future we will

1631
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:15,170
find other you know kind of similar

1632
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:17,690
security issues on those so it's really

1633
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:19,820
hard to trust that anymore so you will

1634
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:22,280
need to think differently when you are

1635
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,550
building soft on top of that so as it

1636
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:29,389
was said on the previous of the previous

1637
01:27:29,389 --> 01:27:31,489
demonstration previous talk all layers

1638
01:27:31,489 --> 01:27:33,080
are really important if you have

1639
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,300
something that you can trust so okay

1640
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,550
this was the context what about the

1641
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,530
impacts on the authorization now because

1642
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:43,159
we saw that it's going more and more you

1643
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:44,719
know difficult to have something secure

1644
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,619
and what about the translational that so

1645
01:27:47,619 --> 01:27:51,949
the problem is if you start to make

1646
01:27:51,949 --> 01:27:53,840
mitigation in your for example

1647
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,630
hypervisor then it could have a cost for

1648
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,699
example you can just choose to disable

1649
01:27:58,699 --> 01:28:00,260
hyper threading but you can also make

1650
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,060
some of the choices that will for

1651
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,000
example walk around some calls into the

1652
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,070
CPU but then you will lose performances

1653
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:09,739
so you you must leave the choice to the

1654
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:11,449
user you know to be able to select if

1655
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:13,219
you want if it doesn't trust the

1656
01:28:13,219 --> 01:28:14,929
environment if you are in public cloud

1657
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:16,760
with for example noisy neighbors then

1658
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,010
kind of stuff you you might want to be

1659
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:21,070
really strict on security but if it runs

1660
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:23,540
entirely internally then you know you

1661
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,300
can make your choices and obviously if

1662
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,889
you want to keep your transition you

1663
01:28:27,889 --> 01:28:29,780
need to have a low overhead so you need

1664
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,510
to work on the performances on the

1665
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:34,369
purely compute side or the hypervisor

1666
01:28:34,369 --> 01:28:38,630
side this also the those challenge will

1667
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:41,570
you know push you to work with more CPU

1668
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,940
isolation features like you know I see

1669
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,489
des DX and that kind of stuff from AMD

1670
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:47,760
Intel

1671
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,790
whatever but it's required to integrate

1672
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:53,010
those kind of new possibilities directly

1673
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,050
into the hypervisor to to enjoy those

1674
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:57,420
new way to isolate your virtual machine

1675
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,970
for example but also you need to think a

1676
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:03,090
big in the way that there's more and

1677
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:05,670
more cores coming for example on recent

1678
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:09,630
AMD CPUs so all this work will also have

1679
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:12,090
an impact on the performances so and

1680
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,130
this will be far more complex you know

1681
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,890
to tune for every for example for Sipi

1682
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,720
specific cores or for specific machines

1683
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,730
so it's it's even more complexity and

1684
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,530
that's not all

1685
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,920
it's just don't stop on the server

1686
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,630
virtualization world because right now

1687
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:30,840
we are seeing actualization pushed you

1688
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,390
know in the NBN world or in the edge

1689
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,220
computing world which is really really

1690
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,020
interesting in the way that you know

1691
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,630
people like to have flexibility directly

1692
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,950
on the field they can respond the ends

1693
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:46,140
directly for a small machine that's

1694
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,030
running to a factory and that's great

1695
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:50,790
and and you know you can have very great

1696
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:53,400
features by doing that but the thing is

1697
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,880
you think you have to think about

1698
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,860
surviving into an environment where you

1699
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,780
know into the factory some people could

1700
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,330
even steal the box or our access

1701
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:05,160
physically to the box it's not a data

1702
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,080
center anymore so so again it's another

1703
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,690
thing to think when you are building a

1704
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:13,020
virtualization another I would say

1705
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,390
interesting topics to explore there's

1706
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,489
also new CPU architecture that's good I

1707
01:30:17,489 --> 01:30:19,980
mean be a game changer I mean it's hard

1708
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,920
to to be really sure it will you know

1709
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,100
execute but in the end if you don't have

1710
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,100
you know the dependency against

1711
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,100
completely closed

1712
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,630
microcode then you could probably build

1713
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,040
the platform that's fully open source

1714
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,320
from the hardware to the application and

1715
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,320
that's why it's very interesting and

1716
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,880
that's also why you need to keep all of

1717
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,330
those architecture on your radar if you

1718
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,960
are working into the hypervisor industry

1719
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,820
so specifically for the virtualization

1720
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:54,989
the way to to tackle all those problems

1721
01:30:54,989 --> 01:30:57,270
there is I would say my opinion there's

1722
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,460
three main ways to do that the first one

1723
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,080
is the obvious one I mean I'm an

1724
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:01,620
engineer

1725
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,770
there's a lot of people here who are

1726
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:06,840
also engineers and the first thing that

1727
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,250
you are thinking is okay there is a

1728
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,230
technical problem I would find technical

1729
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:12,180
solution so that's great this is a way

1730
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,910
to to cope with those issues but it's

1731
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:17,730
just one parts I would say even one

1732
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:19,950
third of the way to find a solution for

1733
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:22,650
this challenges so that's why we all see

1734
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:24,630
you so other solution but first let's

1735
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:28,740
let's go to the technical solution on

1736
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:31,860
the technical side as because I said a

1737
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,260
lot of things just before about all the

1738
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,660
complexity and the need to adapt quickly

1739
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,270
then your code should be able to adapt

1740
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:41,190
to so when you are building the advisor

1741
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:43,770
you need to be modular it's you know

1742
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,540
it's the end of the time of when you are

1743
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,010
doing something for just one platform

1744
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:50,750
it's a great challenge of I would say

1745
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:53,850
general purpose advisor is to be able to

1746
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,510
deliver something that will be working

1747
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:59,370
for the user need depending on the user

1748
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:01,440
hardware and you should be able to

1749
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,360
select what kind of the hypervisor you

1750
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,850
want to use so you need to rethink of

1751
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:07,410
its how it's done and to make some

1752
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:09,990
somehow like kind of plugins if you like

1753
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,180
so some people would like to run

1754
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,770
stripped-down versions for example of

1755
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,510
the hypervisor so for then its goal of

1756
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:18,240
NXT or QoS or having you know the whole

1757
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,770
full spectrum of security features

1758
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,260
enable or disable regarding their

1759
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,210
requirements and you need to have a good

1760
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:26,460
reputation to do that so technically you

1761
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,260
must have something that can be you know

1762
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:30,450
really modular and that's not it

1763
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:32,610
technically you should provide you must

1764
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:36,060
provide a way for the users to enjoy an

1765
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,210
easy way to updates because as you know

1766
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:42,120
there is more and more security issues

1767
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,450
found and the whole world especially in

1768
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,890
the software is going faster and faster

1769
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:49,350
so you need to react fast and for that

1770
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:51,180
you need to provide patches really fast

1771
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:53,460
and if it's a pain to apply then your

1772
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,050
end user won't apply their patches

1773
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:56,820
because it means you know it's too much

1774
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,160
work and if their patch every month then

1775
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,050
you know they can't keep up the pace and

1776
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:03,450
they will let the solution like this and

1777
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:04,860
in between you know with a lot of flows

1778
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:08,040
so it's also your responsibility to

1779
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,750
build something that's very easy to

1780
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,660
update so for that there is uncensored

1781
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,250
very interesting features like late

1782
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,380
microcon loading so you

1783
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,790
have to you know reboot if you load a

1784
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:18,830
new micro card into the CPU life

1785
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:20,540
patching so you can you know live patch

1786
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,820
then to get the latest security patches

1787
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:24,320
if you like without know any

1788
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,660
consequences on the your virtual machine

1789
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,760
running on the house and there's even

1790
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,530
the hypervisor live upgrade which is

1791
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:32,300
switching from a Zen version to a new

1792
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:32,690
one

1793
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,340
within the same house without any

1794
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,780
virtual machine interruption so that's

1795
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:38,470
really a really cool use case that

1796
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:42,830
iws did you know contribute to there's a

1797
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:44,270
link if you want to read the paper the

1798
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:46,970
concept is pretty powerful in an

1799
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:51,200
interesting but also a more general

1800
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,390
thing the technical solution are also

1801
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:55,100
research in developments by that I mean

1802
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,500
finding solution concrete solution to

1803
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,930
you know overcome the issue the security

1804
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:02,000
issues it can have on the hardware so

1805
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,580
it's not an exhaustive list because it

1806
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:06,500
would have been really you know very

1807
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,320
long and explaining all of them into

1808
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,300
great details would take you know days

1809
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,550
but to give you some ideas and some

1810
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,230
leads to to to dig if you want to know

1811
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:17,960
more interesting stuff out for example

1812
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:21,560
course scheduling it's a way to keep VMs

1813
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,230
on the self same physical core despite

1814
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:26,630
having hyper-threading so you will limit

1815
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,880
the chances of leaking data between you

1816
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,550
know branch prediction problems that you

1817
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:34,250
have on for example Intel CPUs the

1818
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,870
segregation is a way to have more

1819
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,910
isolation like a defense in depth you

1820
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:40,640
know if you are losing the network side

1821
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,200
or the storage side you won't compromise

1822
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,800
all the compute side etc or even you

1823
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,920
know having an hypervisor that's where

1824
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,010
you are you know getting it into if you

1825
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:54,530
hack it then you can take any secrets so

1826
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:56,510
those are some solution technical

1827
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:59,630
solution that are really walk down by

1828
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:02,210
you know Zen developers on the Sun side

1829
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:05,180
because this is the hypervisor I know I

1830
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,740
know the best and and there's people

1831
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,540
really talented people working on that

1832
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,330
from you know six weeks AWS or you know

1833
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:14,930
Susie or really big users of Zen at

1834
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:19,250
scale so other really important pieces

1835
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:22,160
of that our organizational solution like

1836
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,630
improvement process because you have

1837
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,550
more and more you know flows more and

1838
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:28,640
more security issues because of hardware

1839
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,270
or even you

1840
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:30,650
your software you need to have a process

1841
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:36,020
and this really a central piece of thing

1842
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,550
in your project in your open source

1843
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,590
project is if you have good workflow

1844
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,540
when you have a security issue and and

1845
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,950
the Zen one is really great because

1846
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:44,810
again this is used by big cloud vendors

1847
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:46,790
so they had to agree on the way to work

1848
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:48,920
with that you had a checklist you had

1849
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,500
you know where to make to communicate

1850
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,630
around that and this is the process is

1851
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,630
is vital to be able to be able to cook

1852
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:58,580
with those security issues but also

1853
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,440
because it's open source you can use the

1854
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,610
community in that's really great with

1855
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:02,890
open source because you can you know

1856
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,810
meet people having a discussion with

1857
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:06,800
them on the field

1858
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,660
discussing with end users but also

1859
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:10,220
exchange with other open source project

1860
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:12,980
like ADM or even the Linux kernel and we

1861
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:15,080
love to do that inside the design

1862
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,060
project because it's for example for

1863
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,130
course scheduling it was first since

1864
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:21,710
then but the design helps you to build

1865
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:25,220
it from you know KVM guys input etc so

1866
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,810
that's that's why it's really important

1867
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,750
to to collaborate that scale and

1868
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,630
obviously being inclusive especially for

1869
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:35,060
security people to be friendly to them

1870
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,770
when they come to to assist you

1871
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:39,110
regarding projects that's that's vital

1872
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:42,110
but also another thing that matters

1873
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:44,330
alerts is okay you got a technical

1874
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:46,400
solution and you got a good process but

1875
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,620
then you need ideally something where

1876
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,510
all of that is integrated and and by

1877
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:53,630
that I mean a solution or product if you

1878
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:56,140
want to call it is that way but

1879
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:59,270
something that's been able to gather all

1880
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:01,520
you know people from different projects

1881
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,380
who deliver something that can be easily

1882
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,350
used so some something that able to

1883
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,260
federate people around it with some you

1884
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:12,440
know for example processes or being able

1885
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,930
to have a way to secure things by

1886
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,720
default because it's a good way to do

1887
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,670
things you know to be secure by default

1888
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:23,690
and also to to have people able to cross

1889
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:25,700
boundaries across for example the

1890
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,880
compute world the storage world etc this

1891
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,620
is really important to be able to have

1892
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,600
people working on a multiple components

1893
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,710
at once

1894
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:37,880
so give you an example I'm telling you

1895
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,830
about that because that's the kind of

1896
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:41,480
stuff and I would say the exactly the

1897
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,280
kind of stuff that we are doing we

1898
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,430
see PNG is an orchestra so again XE PNG

1899
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:49,820
is n distro if you like Elena's distro

1900
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,470
you know that's it's based on Sam it's

1901
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:52,970
working out of the box you just you know

1902
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,250
download install it's it's bundled with

1903
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,560
different project less than Linux open V

1904
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,510
switch got an API on top of that and

1905
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:00,830
it's fully open source everyone can

1906
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:02,420
contribute and it's very welcome to

1907
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,130
contribute and on top of that you got

1908
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:06,980
the web management thing to do all the

1909
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,180
operation on top of it

1910
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:12,400
so our work with this project is to

1911
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,780
build bridges for example between

1912
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,670
communities so you can bring people

1913
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:19,940
together to work on your you know on the

1914
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:22,940
solution because sometimes having you

1915
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,290
know developers and end-users

1916
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:26,360
communicating together is not something

1917
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,430
really easy federates other project from

1918
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:30,980
inside and then or you know the API or

1919
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:33,230
even outside like other distro that can

1920
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:34,940
be better integrated into the veterans

1921
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:37,010
asian platform being six your by default

1922
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:39,050
that i said but also having a lot of

1923
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:40,630
work and we are doing a lot of work

1924
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:43,340
regarding research and developments for

1925
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,080
example six your boots or improve the

1926
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,290
performances and that kind of things so

1927
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:50,570
by the way if you are interested to do

1928
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:53,030
that kind of research we are hiring

1929
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:56,630
so yeah the goal is to have a turnkey

1930
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:58,610
solution in the end that might help to

1931
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:00,920
do all those to tackle all the security

1932
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,480
issues I mean we are not the only

1933
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,430
project doing that but this is really

1934
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:05,690
important to keep in mind that's not

1935
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,790
just a technical thing but really a way

1936
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:11,360
to organize stuff around it so in

1937
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:16,100
conclusion broadly not for EXCI PNG or

1938
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,200
even then but this relation we'll see

1939
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,180
more more challenges coming than ever

1940
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:23,810
more security shoes more complexity on

1941
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:26,690
the physical layer and we and all the

1942
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:28,160
virtualization editor need to keep the

1943
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,040
pace because it required it's requiring

1944
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,680
a lot more collaboration than ever even

1945
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:37,550
how vendors and with researcher with PhD

1946
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:40,070
with you know academic world and and all

1947
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:42,350
of that needs to you know solve the

1948
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:44,030
security problems but also limit the

1949
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:45,890
overhead so you also have a performance

1950
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,420
challenge that's really interesting

1951
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:50,840
to try to solve with that and what's

1952
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,580
even more interesting in that we are

1953
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,530
seeing in the markets I would say in the

1954
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,140
market in general that there is

1955
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,140
or new companies trying to do innovative

1956
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:03,590
stuff on the lower end on the the side

1957
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:06,260
on the more hardware stuff so there's

1958
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:08,330
some companies trying to build you know

1959
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:11,510
even CPUs or you know more integrated

1960
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:13,310
hardware etcetera so that might be a

1961
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:15,710
great opportunity that people start to

1962
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,480
really think about you know we have

1963
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,400
problems with this Hardware maybe we can

1964
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,220
do something else and this is where the

1965
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:25,010
translation not be also work together

1966
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:27,170
with those persons because it might you

1967
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:28,640
know deliver some really awesome

1968
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,790
products so this is it in the end it's

1969
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:33,290
really exciting time for virtualization

1970
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:35,810
more than ever and we are really happy

1971
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:38,420
if people want you to do that with us

1972
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:41,810
and if you have any question feel free

1973
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:53,330
to go ahead and otherwise thank you okay

1974
01:40:53,330 --> 01:41:03,500
thank you much presentation use the

1975
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:09,710
human arm button you know that was what

[Music]

1977
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:16,880
ng offer in another two in front of

1978
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,620
security so right now we are you know so

1979
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:24,040
we took something that already exists

1980
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,600
for example we have the steady support

1981
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,220
from XenServer so we are using some

1982
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:30,740
existing security feature from you know

1983
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:32,690
XenServer so as you may know Zen by

1984
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,880
itself is really trusting in the way

1985
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,700
that isolation is made so by default I

1986
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,310
would say by design isolation is pretty

1987
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:42,590
nice but we are working right now to

1988
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:45,290
improve for example all the secure boot

1989
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,300
capabilities both from the guests from

1990
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:49,760
the VM but also from the hosts and for

1991
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,980
that we are working with with little

1992
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:53,750
insight people from different companies

1993
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:56,600
working on different project like for

1994
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,090
example trench boot or even you know a

1995
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:02,330
similar project where security might be

1996
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:04,220
really important and to be fair the Zen

1997
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,710
project itself because then is the

1998
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:09,110
engine you know that we are using XE p

1999
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:11,099
ng but it's also used by a lot

2000
01:42:11,099 --> 01:42:13,260
different companies wear them for

2001
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,409
example working very you know security

2002
01:42:16,409 --> 01:42:18,630
oriented world and the work they are

2003
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:23,250
doing is you know being considered and

2004
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,320
probably will be integrated inside XE

2005
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,770
P&G so there is a lot of different

2006
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:30,210
techniques you know that you can use as

2007
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,860
I said like course scheduling that my

2008
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:34,889
inner race the security using TPM easier

2009
01:42:34,889 --> 01:42:35,250
boots

2010
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,139
etc so there's a long list of

2011
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:40,679
possibilities and I think to to and and

2012
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:42,510
saw your question that somehow people

2013
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:45,239
felt that virtualization was something a

2014
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:47,579
bit static you know that it's there and

2015
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:50,099
it won't move anymore but it's exactly

2016
01:42:50,099 --> 01:42:50,730
the opposite

2017
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:52,860
there are so many things that are going

2018
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:57,300
on right now in the Zen world okay thank

2019
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:01,650
you my second question I'm a processor

2020
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:06,179
seems to be more popular even ever other

2021
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:10,380
elements something about the security

2022
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:16,380
Association so so you are talking about

2023
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,230
security and visualization for other

2024
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:22,590
CPUs or their architecture well for now

2025
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:25,349
I can say about XE PNG is for now we are

2026
01:43:25,349 --> 01:43:28,440
only x86 compatible but we are keeping

2027
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,090
an eye on other architecture like you

2028
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:32,159
said arm especially since graviton -

2029
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:35,280
which is a specific sub made by AWS

2030
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,989
that's not available and the public but

2031
01:43:36,989 --> 01:43:39,510
silly it shows that you can start to

2032
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,250
have really nice performances on the

2033
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:45,030
server for outside the x x86 world and I

2034
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:46,679
know there's some security

2035
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:49,079
you know hardware security things in

2036
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:51,840
Armour I think we've seen some of them

2037
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,599
in the previous talk but I'm not a norm

2038
01:43:54,599 --> 01:43:56,730
specialist what I can say is there is

2039
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:59,040
indeed some traction to to do things

2040
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,860
correctly because you know arm was you

2041
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,900
know trendy maybe eight years ago and

2042
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05,760
people even like me thought that arm

2043
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,530
will be on the server in a matter of you

2044
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:09,750
know month but it didn't happen so we'll

2045
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:12,349
see what happened but also other

2046
01:44:12,349 --> 01:44:15,150
architectures are on their radar that

2047
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:16,710
might be really interesting like risk 5

2048
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,989
because it's fully open source and and

2049
01:44:18,989 --> 01:44:21,030
that's why we are you know trying to

2050
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:24,000
start to port Xen to race 5 but it's a

2051
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:24,780
long run

2052
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,820
but we would like to have this because

2053
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,530
in the end because we love a good source

2054
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:30,480
that would be really great to have a

2055
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,010
fully open source platform from the

2056
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:36,719
hardware to the applications okay thank

2057
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:41,429
you imagine luckily so we have a little

2058
01:44:41,429 --> 01:44:46,380
pose the next presentation will be in 50

2059
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:50,340
minutes see you soon you can have a

2060
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:55,610

hello okay so we can continue for dia

2070
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:15,440
for this afternoon so the next

2071
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,960
presentation will be from Damien Kokila

2072
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:22,390
from digital security and we're going to

2073
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:26,140
speak about the wall was of the machine

2074
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:35,600
so I mean you can talk we don't even

2075
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:44,000
tell you you are muted you have to

2076
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,690
unmute your microphone okay it's good

2077
02:00:57,850 --> 02:01:03,590
for you okay can you see my screen just

2078
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:07,580
to make sure all the TV seems okay so

2079
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:12,500
yeah I'm going to talk about I'm going

2080
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:15,760
to talk about one of the machines or

2081
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:19,070
more precisely or two you can be your

2082
02:01:19,070 --> 02:01:21,560
own second district rabbit with the

2083
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:24,410
open-source technology so Who am I I'm

2084
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:27,250
CEO security researcher digital security

2085
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:31,370
just to make things sure I'm definitely

2086
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:35,000
not machine learning expert my field is

2087
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,160
mostly security but I'm going to dig

2088
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,610
into this machine learning stuff and I

2089
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:46,100
love knowing use new thing new stuff so

2090
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,770
this is a this is just all about me and

2091
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:52,210
let's stop with those money tradition so

2092
02:01:52,210 --> 02:01:55,760
during the lockdown I looked at machine

2093
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:58,460
learning and since a month before and

2094
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:01,220
machine learning is cool you know it's

2095
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:05,510
it's it's always something yeah it's

2096
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:07,070
something amazing it's it amazed me

2097
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:09,890
every time I see this kind of stuff you

2098
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:12,410
know people doing things such as an

2099
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:16,360
application able to do spot hot dogs

2100
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:18,010
with the smartphone so yeah this is

2101
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:20,860
something awesome and if you have a look

2102
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:22,930
at what China does with machine learning

2103
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:27,400
and especially with some concealer we

2104
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,980
can say none of the different things

2105
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:32,320
with machine learning so this is again

2106
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,420
quite amazing they are able to spot

2107
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:37,750
people on webcams on cameras and

2108
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:39,940
surveillance cameras and cars and so on

2109
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:42,130
this looks awesome

2110
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:47,050
this kami to my mind that what if I I

2111
02:02:47,050 --> 02:02:50,620
try to do the same with all the tools I

2112
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:53,470
can have or I can find on the Internet

2113
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:56,710
I was also amazed by defect you know the

2114
02:02:56,710 --> 02:03:00,580
this technology that is able to put say

2115
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:05,620
another act of face on people in the

2116
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:08,050
advertisement for instance this one is

2117
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:12,460
that kids won't face on normally if an

2118
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:14,950
actress playing in D head so this is

2119
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:17,560
something again interesting but machine

2120
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:21,310
so it was said I was going to learn

2121
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:22,930
machine learning so that's a challenge

2122
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:25,630
for me like I said I'm mostly in the

2123
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:27,700
computer security field not in the

2124
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,650
machine learning field I have absolutely

2125
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:31,960
no clue what I'm doing but never mind I

2126
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:35,470
will learn about it so I decided to

2127
02:03:35,470 --> 02:03:37,810
start with a little project in order to

2128
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:40,870
experiment this machine learning stuff

2129
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:43,870
and I need to I needed to start very

2130
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:45,880
small you know I don't I did not want

2131
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:48,760
you to go into a big project that would

2132
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:52,000
take time to complete and it's something

2133
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,710
small and it's something that will give

2134
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:57,390
some reason very shortly and because I'm

2135
02:03:57,390 --> 02:04:00,490
I'm this kind of person you know we need

2136
02:04:00,490 --> 02:04:02,890
to get visit very quickly in order to

2137
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:04,780
know that I'm on the right track for

2138
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:09,070
this and also and it's something related

2139
02:04:09,070 --> 02:04:11,320
to IOT security because like I said this

2140
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:14,070
is my field this is something I'm into

2141
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:18,370
since ages so obviously if this little

2142
02:04:18,370 --> 02:04:20,800
project could help myself finding some

2143
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,580
or creating some kind of tool that may

2144
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:27,190
be useful in my to day work this could

2145
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:30,099
also be very interesting so what

2146
02:04:30,099 --> 02:04:32,619
at all that would be able to give a big

2147
02:04:32,619 --> 02:04:35,829
picture about IOT security and I would

2148
02:04:35,829 --> 02:04:39,520
see devices that one can find on on the

2149
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,760
internet why not so I've started with a

2150
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:46,570
small feature arrest and in this section

2151
02:04:46,570 --> 02:04:49,030
is the first one was to be able to scan

2152
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:53,349
collect information about devices from

2153
02:04:53,349 --> 02:04:56,860
mostly HTTP services because this HTTP

2154
02:04:56,860 --> 02:05:00,310
services are very very popular in IOT

2155
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:02,469
devices exposed on the internet so this

2156
02:05:02,469 --> 02:05:05,829
is one way to find some smart devices on

2157
02:05:05,829 --> 02:05:06,429
the Internet

2158
02:05:06,429 --> 02:05:09,880
HTTP is very very common I went through

2159
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:12,550
this project to be honest or to be also

2160
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:15,429
able to classify these devices so to put

2161
02:05:15,429 --> 02:05:18,219
them into groups of similar devices and

2162
02:05:18,219 --> 02:05:21,340
to do this automatically I did not want

2163
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:24,130
to 12 euro thousands of devices web

2164
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:26,110
service is available on the internet by

2165
02:05:26,110 --> 02:05:28,690
hand because it would take time takes

2166
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:31,750
time to do it so I decided that this

2167
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:34,360
tool must be able to classify this

2168
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:36,659
device by using machine learning as well

2169
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:40,900
and the study should also provide an

2170
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:43,150
overview of coastal provinces devices

2171
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:45,130
available on the internet like you know

2172
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:48,010
be able to make some stats out of the

2173
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:50,980
collected data and so on and the last

2174
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:54,310
point and this is something very

2175
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:58,020
interesting I guess because we can use

2176
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:00,880
also the same technologies included in

2177
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,860
this tool to maybe create targeted

2178
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:06,010
attacks just if you want to choose to

2179
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:09,579
target some kind of devices in the

2180
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:11,290
automatic way with the some kind of

2181
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:13,239
robot that would scan the internet and

2182
02:06:13,239 --> 02:06:16,210
find interesting devices and then attack

2183
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:19,119
them collect information do something

2184
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:21,429
nicely with these devices this is the

2185
02:06:21,429 --> 02:06:24,400
same way we can achieve this by also the

2186
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:28,360
same technologies so yeah if I was not

2187
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:30,400
sure about this last point but in fact

2188
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,230
this could be interesting and firm

2189
02:06:32,230 --> 02:06:34,869
I thought internet about previous

2190
02:06:34,869 --> 02:06:37,300
research and people previously block so

2191
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:42,090
I found a paper published at home it's a

2192
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:44,550
presentation

2193
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:48,099
published laughter I'd use NYX about an

2194
02:06:48,099 --> 02:06:50,530
analysis of IOT devices on home networks

2195
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:53,619
and this paper contents on machine no

2196
02:06:53,619 --> 02:06:56,619
matrix this is the author of this paper

2197
02:06:56,619 --> 02:07:00,939
major to determine but the most popular

2198
02:07:00,939 --> 02:07:06,609
devices in you know in people homes and

2199
02:07:06,609 --> 02:07:09,789
also another paper but Profeta UT which

2200
02:07:09,789 --> 02:07:11,949
is a machine learning approach for IOT

2201
02:07:11,949 --> 02:07:13,929
device identification based on network

2202
02:07:13,929 --> 02:07:17,619
traffic analysis again this is done at

2203
02:07:17,619 --> 02:07:20,289
the network level so we need to capture

2204
02:07:20,289 --> 02:07:23,019
traffic between the devices and the

2205
02:07:23,019 --> 02:07:25,209
Internet to be able to to categorize

2206
02:07:25,209 --> 02:07:28,149
these devices and to classify to traffic

2207
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:29,979
classify them but this is not what I

2208
02:07:29,979 --> 02:07:32,889
need because I want you to be able to

2209
02:07:32,889 --> 02:07:35,469
detect and classify these devices based

2210
02:07:35,469 --> 02:07:38,589
on the exposure of the devices on the

2211
02:07:38,589 --> 02:07:41,979
Internet so the main question is how is

2212
02:07:41,979 --> 02:07:46,780
it done how can one can use just machine

2213
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:49,809
learning tool to get this this this tool

2214
02:07:49,809 --> 02:07:52,659
designed so this is made the main

2215
02:07:52,659 --> 02:07:56,079
question so I looked at all this machine

2216
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:59,559
learning trickery and it's at first it

2217
02:07:59,559 --> 02:08:02,800
looks quite interesting because the main

2218
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,479
question about machine learning is how

2219
02:08:04,479 --> 02:08:07,389
can we make machine there

2220
02:08:07,389 --> 02:08:10,899
I can machine down because this is

2221
02:08:10,899 --> 02:08:13,419
almost the answer is pretty simple you

2222
02:08:13,419 --> 02:08:15,639
know this is a similar as our brain down

2223
02:08:15,639 --> 02:08:18,729
so we are going to teach the Machine how

2224
02:08:18,729 --> 02:08:21,479
to do a small task and then based on the

2225
02:08:21,479 --> 02:08:25,059
trained machine we can get wizard from

2226
02:08:25,059 --> 02:08:27,550
it so this is quite obvious because you

2227
02:08:27,550 --> 02:08:29,349
know this is machine learning they were

2228
02:08:29,349 --> 02:08:33,609
within this learning hm in the in this

2229
02:08:33,609 --> 02:08:35,289
machine learning stuff so this is this

2230
02:08:35,289 --> 02:08:37,929
is a yeah obvious but technically this

2231
02:08:37,929 --> 02:08:41,889
is not so obvious so first for thing

2232
02:08:41,889 --> 02:08:43,989
first we are going to train and try to

2233
02:08:43,989 --> 02:08:45,609
predict an answer using machine learning

2234
02:08:45,609 --> 02:08:48,069
so this is done by training a machine to

2235
02:08:48,069 --> 02:08:50,859
do a precise task for instance I want to

2236
02:08:50,859 --> 02:08:53,319
machine to be able to tell if there is a

2237
02:08:53,319 --> 02:08:55,959
cut in a specific image we give the

2238
02:08:55,959 --> 02:08:57,269
machine in image and

2239
02:08:57,269 --> 02:08:59,760
mission we'd be able to answer this

2240
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,010
question is there cutting this image so

2241
02:09:02,010 --> 02:09:04,709
how how do we achieve this by training

2242
02:09:04,709 --> 02:09:06,809
the machine we give this machine a lot

2243
02:09:06,809 --> 02:09:10,169
of cutting edges and then this machine

2244
02:09:10,169 --> 02:09:12,269
will learn to recognize this kind of

2245
02:09:12,269 --> 02:09:14,449
images and if we put on the machine with

2246
02:09:14,449 --> 02:09:17,909
a random image of a cat or not a cat

2247
02:09:17,909 --> 02:09:20,249
then it will be able to tell if it's a

2248
02:09:20,249 --> 02:09:22,079
cat or not so this is what we call

2249
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:24,059
supervised learning because we need to

2250
02:09:24,059 --> 02:09:27,809
provide the machine with a specific set

2251
02:09:27,809 --> 02:09:29,969
of images that corresponds to the

2252
02:09:29,969 --> 02:09:32,189
correct output and also other images

2253
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:34,739
that does not correspond to the to the

2254
02:09:34,739 --> 02:09:36,359
supports or we are going to give this

2255
02:09:36,359 --> 02:09:38,369
machine a house image and tell this

2256
02:09:38,369 --> 02:09:40,469
machine that's not a cat obviously you

2257
02:09:40,469 --> 02:09:42,869
know and so on so this way the machine

2258
02:09:42,869 --> 02:09:45,569
can be run and give a result technically

2259
02:09:45,569 --> 02:09:47,969
how it's down is done using some kind of

2260
02:09:47,969 --> 02:09:50,809
neuron neural network so the main

2261
02:09:50,809 --> 02:09:53,429
concept of neural network and main

2262
02:09:53,429 --> 02:09:55,319
limitation is a perceptron so this is

2263
02:09:55,319 --> 02:09:57,569
basically some neurons interconnected

2264
02:09:57,569 --> 02:10:01,019
with different layers and we give on the

2265
02:10:01,019 --> 02:10:03,149
left side of this image on this neural

2266
02:10:03,149 --> 02:10:06,119
network we give some input data and the

2267
02:10:06,119 --> 02:10:08,369
system is going to compute some weights

2268
02:10:08,369 --> 02:10:11,069
between all these neurons in order to to

2269
02:10:11,069 --> 02:10:13,049
propagate the information to the output

2270
02:10:13,049 --> 02:10:15,299
and the output will tell the correct

2271
02:10:15,299 --> 02:10:17,760
answer if it's not the correct answer

2272
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,609
then the system will be corrected will

2273
02:10:20,609 --> 02:10:23,459
be fixed by using some kind of back

2274
02:10:23,459 --> 02:10:26,839
propagation and the weights of the

2275
02:10:26,839 --> 02:10:28,979
connection between all these neurons

2276
02:10:28,979 --> 02:10:30,659
will be adjusted in order to give the

2277
02:10:30,659 --> 02:10:32,819
correct input so the more input you give

2278
02:10:32,819 --> 02:10:35,039
to the system and the more reliable we

2279
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:39,229
get the output bit get so this is

2280
02:10:39,229 --> 02:10:41,459
something not very tricky to implement

2281
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:43,949
but as we are going to see later and put

2282
02:10:43,949 --> 02:10:45,809
in the in this presentation this is not

2283
02:10:45,809 --> 02:10:50,669
ready very important so you get a lot

2284
02:10:50,669 --> 02:10:52,169
you give the Machine a lot of catch

2285
02:10:52,169 --> 02:10:54,959
measures and get the correct wizard you

2286
02:10:54,959 --> 02:10:58,010
can also ask a specific machine to

2287
02:10:58,010 --> 02:11:02,279
classify data based on specific data set

2288
02:11:02,279 --> 02:11:04,769
so if I ask emotions to sort a set of

2289
02:11:04,769 --> 02:11:07,579
images just like animals for instance I

2290
02:11:07,579 --> 02:11:10,319
expect this machine to put dogs in the

2291
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:11,310
herb cats in the

2292
02:11:11,310 --> 02:11:14,300
all season in other groups and so on and

2293
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,800
the way it works is that the machine

2294
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,450
will find similarities between these

2295
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:20,760
images and group them and mostly this

2296
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:23,010
kind of system is able to find

2297
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:26,520
relationships between data inputs that

2298
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:29,280
is not very trivial and then make verbs

2299
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:31,860
out of them so this is something I could

2300
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:35,250
yeah it's for humans it's very difficult

2301
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:39,420
to do to perform this kind of sort but

2302
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,550
for machine this is quite obvious so

2303
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:43,440
this is what we called unsupervised

2304
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,780
learning so this this is called

2305
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:47,580
unsupervised because there is no human

2306
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:49,230
involved in this process we let the

2307
02:11:49,230 --> 02:11:52,950
Machine test the job the job so for

2308
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:54,600
example if you want to sort a set of

2309
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:56,820
data about vehicles and we are going to

2310
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:58,710
describe each vehicle with the number of

2311
02:11:58,710 --> 02:12:01,560
wheels and sit and let the machine do

2312
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:04,440
the rest so if I gave us some images of

2313
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:06,300
this machines with the specific data and

2314
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:08,310
number of seats in wheels then this

2315
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:11,520
machine can group can create groups of

2316
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:14,460
similar vehicles and then give me the

2317
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:17,100
answer but the machine cannot that this

2318
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:19,380
is a plane or this is a car this machine

2319
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:21,810
which just gives me groups of similar

2320
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:23,120
items

2321
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:25,950
this is don't technically with some

2322
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:29,130
clustering algorithm so this is the most

2323
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:33,150
not not most simple but this is one one

2324
02:12:33,150 --> 02:12:35,400
type of algorithm that is currently used

2325
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:39,150
and usually used for this kind of stuff

2326
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:43,920
this is k-means clustering so this is

2327
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:46,920
very basic you know you put your data

2328
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:49,410
point based on the the characteristics

2329
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:52,260
say for instance and the on the x-axis

2330
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:54,420
we can put the number of wheels and the

2331
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:56,160
y-axis you can put another of seeds and

2332
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:59,310
then you plot your vehicles on this map

2333
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,590
then you are going to put some Sun

2334
02:13:01,590 --> 02:13:03,780
traits what what is called Sun trees

2335
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:05,910
this is basically a point in this in

2336
02:13:05,910 --> 02:13:08,640
this two dimension space and this

2337
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:11,010
centroids are going to move toward the

2338
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:14,850
the nearest group of items based on

2339
02:13:14,850 --> 02:13:18,090
mathematical computations and once these

2340
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:20,400
some traits are placed in the middle of

2341
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,920
the group then all the items near the

2342
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,079
centroid will be

2343
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:27,440
categorize group so the result is that

2344
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,659
we get some groups of items but we have

2345
02:13:29,659 --> 02:13:32,239
no clue what these items are just that

2346
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:35,960
they are in a way similar of the it

2347
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:39,139
exists a link between them this

2348
02:13:39,139 --> 02:13:41,750
algorithm is quite interesting because

2349
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:44,360
it's based on a number of centroids

2350
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:46,670
which is set at the beginning so you

2351
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:50,210
need to know how many groups you're

2352
02:13:50,210 --> 02:13:52,219
expecting in order to get valuable

2353
02:13:52,219 --> 02:13:55,340
results out of it if this number of some

2354
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:57,050
trait is too low groups would contain

2355
02:13:57,050 --> 02:13:59,480
multiple subgroups and if it if it is

2356
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:02,869
too high then the group can be spread

2357
02:14:02,869 --> 02:14:05,090
among multiple centroids or multiple

2358
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:08,380
groups and you have to to sort it again

2359
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:10,760
that I will be spread and it's not

2360
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:14,119
really useful there are also other

2361
02:14:14,119 --> 02:14:15,920
algorithm I won't cover in this

2362
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,469
presentation that are in fact these are

2363
02:14:18,469 --> 02:14:21,320
some variants of this game integration

2364
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:23,719
rule something very different but they

2365
02:14:23,719 --> 02:14:25,670
came into algorithm is one of the most

2366
02:14:25,670 --> 02:14:30,469
used as I saw on the internet so just to

2367
02:14:30,469 --> 02:14:32,869
sum it up when we get we have super

2368
02:14:32,869 --> 02:14:35,119
versatile unsupervised learning super

2369
02:14:35,119 --> 02:14:37,130
fast learning so trading we need two

2370
02:14:37,130 --> 02:14:39,260
data sets one for trading one for

2371
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:43,130
testing and we can create these two data

2372
02:14:43,130 --> 02:14:45,199
set from one that I said and the in

2373
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:47,239
supervised learning finds relationships

2374
02:14:47,239 --> 02:14:50,270
or links in chaotic data so this is what

2375
02:14:50,270 --> 02:14:54,199
we are going to use later again suppose

2376
02:14:54,199 --> 02:14:56,199
I learn is super simple and effective

2377
02:14:56,199 --> 02:14:58,880
it's not very difficult to implement its

2378
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:00,530
request read forward true to run

2379
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:02,449
unsupervised learning is more complex

2380
02:15:02,449 --> 02:15:04,460
and more subject to perils because there

2381
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:06,710
is no human involved in this process so

2382
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:09,469
we let the Machine does the job well as

2383
02:15:09,469 --> 02:15:11,179
much you do the job and then we get the

2384
02:15:11,179 --> 02:15:15,369
results and see if it if it fits on it

2385
02:15:15,369 --> 02:15:18,530
all of this organism use data set data

2386
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:22,040
sets it's basically a bunch of data that

2387
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:24,380
is provided to the this algorithm and

2388
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:27,559
these data sets should be correctly

2389
02:15:27,559 --> 02:15:30,110
created if not it could eat your arrows

2390
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:32,780
and this data set can also be biased

2391
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:37,730
if data picked to compel these data

2392
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:41,560
it's not correctly chose chosen but

2393
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:45,050
again if you try to split a single data

2394
02:15:45,050 --> 02:15:47,450
set into to the other data sets training

2395
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:50,120
set and the testing set then you you

2396
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:52,040
have to do it very carefully you know

2397
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,830
that were to get valuable data these

2398
02:15:54,830 --> 02:15:56,750
data sets are composed of what what's

2399
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:59,000
called feature vector feature is a

2400
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,880
measurable characteristic of our input

2401
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:03,470
data so this is some kind of

2402
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:06,320
mathematical value that you can we can

2403
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:09,800
give to this algorithm that we'd feed

2404
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:13,040
the learning process the feature vector

2405
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,140
this is a n dimension vector containing

2406
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:18,200
these features and representing a single

2407
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:20,450
point in this in dimension so this is a

2408
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:25,090
an item of this data set so that's

2409
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:27,890
mostly the theory about machine learning

2410
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:30,770
sir my first question was how to turn

2411
02:16:30,770 --> 02:16:33,709
data into a feature vector and most of

2412
02:16:33,709 --> 02:16:36,260
it I have to correct data so I started

2413
02:16:36,260 --> 02:16:40,190
developing this project by scanning I'm

2414
02:16:40,190 --> 02:16:44,138
quitting the scanner which is the base

2415
02:16:44,138 --> 02:16:47,240
basic of this object rule so this kind

2416
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:49,308
of scan the internet for when on HTTP

2417
02:16:49,308 --> 02:16:52,519
port and then connect valuable data all

2418
02:16:52,519 --> 02:16:55,129
this data is stored in a database and we

2419
02:16:55,129 --> 02:16:58,519
are we will see later how to turn or to

2420
02:16:58,519 --> 02:17:02,990
convert this this data into a feature

2421
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:06,138
vector so creating a data set is quite

2422
02:17:06,138 --> 02:17:08,750
easy you just scan all the internet

2423
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:11,900
looking for HTTP services require the

2424
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:14,660
HTTP address body and we also take a

2425
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:17,330
screenshot of this fish device so this

2426
02:17:17,330 --> 02:17:20,260
is very easy to do with Python and the

2427
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:23,179
pythonic request module you can use tor

2428
02:17:23,179 --> 02:17:27,170
to do to send HTTP queries to remote

2429
02:17:27,170 --> 02:17:28,760
services we are going to use chromium

2430
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:32,150
and selenium to drive chromium and take

2431
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:35,570
screenshots of the remote services so

2432
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:38,360
everything is quite straightforward this

2433
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:40,280
is obviously something very easy to do

2434
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:42,980
in Python for the person who knows

2435
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:46,129
Python and these modules and I started

2436
02:17:46,129 --> 02:17:48,349
grabbing data from all over the Europe

2437
02:17:48,349 --> 02:17:51,679
so I got a scan some

2438
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:54,019
sister in Spain in France in the United

2439
02:17:54,019 --> 02:17:56,959
Kingdom as well I have had no problem no

2440
02:17:56,959 --> 02:17:58,580
issue with the France Spain and Portugal

2441
02:17:58,580 --> 02:18:01,580
but I found some West often in the UK

2442
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:04,519
and a good band from specifically in

2443
02:18:04,519 --> 02:18:06,439
Germany because I was sending too much

2444
02:18:06,439 --> 02:18:11,478
requests to the widows but anyway since

2445
02:18:11,478 --> 02:18:14,689
I was doing this from home and not you I

2446
02:18:14,689 --> 02:18:19,160
was not using any server as I think this

2447
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:23,120
is this is expected so as a result

2448
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:24,949
I'll collected four thousand nine

2449
02:18:24,949 --> 02:18:27,978
hundred and one instrument one pages

2450
02:18:27,978 --> 02:18:32,959
from various devices from many countries

2451
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:35,388
in Europe and if you have a look at the

2452
02:18:35,388 --> 02:18:38,599
at the screenshot I make you can see

2453
02:18:38,599 --> 02:18:41,209
that there are some devices that are

2454
02:18:41,209 --> 02:18:43,609
quite the same but others we have no

2455
02:18:43,609 --> 02:18:46,849
clue about so this was quite interesting

2456
02:18:46,849 --> 02:18:49,728
so now I get all the data in my database

2457
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:52,849
I need to turn this data into something

2458
02:18:52,849 --> 02:18:55,459
which is a mathematical representation

2459
02:18:55,459 --> 02:18:58,429
of this of this data of each page in

2460
02:18:58,429 --> 02:19:01,308
order to create my feature vector so how

2461
02:19:01,308 --> 02:19:03,529
to measure web page are to convert a web

2462
02:19:03,529 --> 02:19:06,199
page into something that can be used to

2463
02:19:06,199 --> 02:19:09,170
feed the machine learning algorithm so

2464
02:19:09,170 --> 02:19:12,468
first of all you can get the continents

2465
02:19:12,468 --> 02:19:15,620
which is which is basically the size of

2466
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:17,898
the answer from the remote service so

2467
02:19:17,898 --> 02:19:20,269
this is usually the same device if it's

2468
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:24,138
novelty but it's not always the case we

2469
02:19:24,138 --> 02:19:26,179
can grab the number of headers all well

2470
02:19:26,179 --> 02:19:29,599
written by the service we can get also

2471
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:32,689
the number of script images and other

2472
02:19:32,689 --> 02:19:35,870
tags present in the HTML page and this

2473
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:40,459
this something that is easily easy to

2474
02:19:40,459 --> 02:19:43,308
get from a web page if you want to do it

2475
02:19:43,308 --> 02:19:45,670
in a badass mode you can also get

2476
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:50,120
further for the mathematical value such

2477
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:53,210
as the levenshtein distance from the web

2478
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:55,850
page or you have gathered between a

2479
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:58,069
reference page so this is basically

2480
02:19:58,069 --> 02:19:59,000
Oscar

2481
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,010
computed based on the similarities

2482
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:03,439
between these two pages we can also

2483
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:05,149
analyze

2484
02:20:05,149 --> 02:20:07,010
document object model structure bar

2485
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:09,380
flattening the trust is this structure

2486
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:10,970
and compare it with the reference

2487
02:20:10,970 --> 02:20:13,729
structure with the by measure is the

2488
02:20:13,729 --> 02:20:15,920
limit same distance between them and you

2489
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:18,229
can also get the size of the nominal

2490
02:20:18,229 --> 02:20:21,560
text page text so you strip all the tags

2491
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:24,070
and keep only the text that is displayed

2492
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:27,260
on the website and the web page sorry

2493
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:30,439
and then you get the size of this so

2494
02:20:30,439 --> 02:20:33,560
this is a more difficult to compute more

2495
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:35,090
difficult to get but this could be

2496
02:20:35,090 --> 02:20:37,520
interesting to to implement our

2497
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:41,720
classifier so distance I talked about

2498
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:45,740
sir based on this I converted all my

2499
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:49,130
data into a series of numbers that can

2500
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:51,590
be analyzed by machine learning

2501
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:55,460
algorithm so I it was time to stop my

2502
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:58,340
automatic classifier so I decided to use

2503
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:00,890
psychic theorem because it's a most

2504
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:02,390
common python-based the machine learning

2505
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:06,290
framework built upon my site by and so

2506
02:21:06,290 --> 02:21:08,660
on and this framework provides

2507
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:10,280
everything we need to do machine

2508
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:14,899
learning first things first I started by

2509
02:21:14,899 --> 02:21:17,630
converting my records from my database

2510
02:21:17,630 --> 02:21:20,479
to a structure that is compatible with

2511
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:23,270
this framework which is called data set

2512
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:26,180
I used some module cut pandas to do this

2513
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:29,120
so basically I extract the valuable data

2514
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:31,220
for the machine learning algorithm from

2515
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:34,189
this from my database and I get address

2516
02:21:34,189 --> 02:21:36,590
number of a doorknob of meta script meta

2517
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:39,020
tag sorry less number of script tags

2518
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:41,420
image tags and the body size which is

2519
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:44,630
basically the HTTP answer size which is

2520
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:47,780
the contaminants I decided to implement

2521
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:49,790
the k-means algorithm for my classifier

2522
02:21:49,790 --> 02:21:52,280
so basically we create a data set from

2523
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:54,830
it and we went this classifier remember

2524
02:21:54,830 --> 02:21:57,830
the number of sandwich matters you need

2525
02:21:57,830 --> 02:22:00,530
to pick the right number I tested this

2526
02:22:00,530 --> 02:22:03,609
system disturber with the number of K

2527
02:22:03,609 --> 02:22:07,250
per hundred and I it didn't work pretty

2528
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:09,710
well because I got a lot of various

2529
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:13,910
devices in us in one group traded with a

2530
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:17,489
thousand centroids and they gave me

2531
02:22:17,489 --> 02:22:20,359
too much results with many devices

2532
02:22:20,359 --> 02:22:23,100
similar devices spread among different

2533
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:25,649
groups I also tested the baddest feature

2534
02:22:25,649 --> 02:22:27,870
vector with the levenshtein distance and

2535
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:30,149
so on and it gave me if a lot of false

2536
02:22:30,149 --> 02:22:34,140
positives because you know muster a lot

2537
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:37,880
of pages look the same so structurally

2538
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:40,680
speaking when you have a look at the

2539
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:43,410
HTML code and so on what gives me the

2540
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:45,449
best results was the basic feature which

2541
02:22:45,449 --> 02:22:48,420
are based only on the specific number of

2542
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:51,449
tags and the number of HTTP headers and

2543
02:22:51,449 --> 02:22:54,029
so on so badass is not the best as I

2544
02:22:54,029 --> 02:22:58,590
thought that it would give me better

2545
02:22:58,590 --> 02:23:01,620
results but in fact it did not because

2546
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:02,729
it's too complicated

2547
02:23:02,729 --> 02:23:06,149
so just take to the Spitzer's the

2548
02:23:06,149 --> 02:23:08,699
intrinsic characteristic of a page by

2549
02:23:08,699 --> 02:23:10,470
keeping the components and number of

2550
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:13,350
tags and so on and by using a number of

2551
02:23:13,350 --> 02:23:16,529
500 son trades in my in my case and it

2552
02:23:16,529 --> 02:23:19,580
gave me a very good reasons for this

2553
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:24,000
k-means algorithm so I ran the system

2554
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,930
upon my data set collected so remember I

2555
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:30,930
grab all the data contact this data into

2556
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:33,090
a data set with the mathematical values

2557
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:36,000
representing each page and then I get

2558
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,819
groups I get groups of what is supposed

2559
02:23:38,819 --> 02:23:41,160
to be similar devices but I need to sort

2560
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:44,330
them and I decide to add metadata to

2561
02:23:44,330 --> 02:23:48,449
keep track of this this item so I'm

2562
02:23:48,449 --> 02:23:51,930
going to use to add a category can be

2563
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:54,870
network attached storage whereas with a

2564
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:57,540
vendor product name and so on and I

2565
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:59,850
decided to also do this by using Russian

2566
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:02,370
only so this this time we are not going

2567
02:24:02,370 --> 02:24:05,430
to use some unsupervised classifier but

2568
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:06,660
we are going to use supervised learning

2569
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:11,399
because we need by using this we'd be

2570
02:24:11,399 --> 02:24:13,319
able to automatically add this metadata

2571
02:24:13,319 --> 02:24:15,479
but we need a reference data set with

2572
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:18,710
very fine metadata that means I need

2573
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:22,460
data set with with non result with

2574
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:26,850
metadata already associated to this item

2575
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:28,770
so I decided to create a small interface

2576
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:30,819
small web interface to

2577
02:24:30,819 --> 02:24:34,120
I'd automatically metadata to this and

2578
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:37,840
to the system and then I was about to to

2579
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:40,660
review all the old item removed all the

2580
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:44,319
false positives that have been reported

2581
02:24:44,319 --> 02:24:47,410
by this system and then I was able to

2582
02:24:47,410 --> 02:24:51,729
add automatically for the entire group

2583
02:24:51,729 --> 02:24:54,130
to add some metadata and save this

2584
02:24:54,130 --> 02:24:57,130
metadata into the database so by doing

2585
02:24:57,130 --> 02:24:59,680
this in a few hours I was able to sort

2586
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:03,160
everything out and have my reference

2587
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:07,990
data set so then it's possible to train

2588
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:10,210
a model for each category and we create

2589
02:25:10,210 --> 02:25:12,430
a perceptron watch category and we need

2590
02:25:12,430 --> 02:25:14,470
to have enough input data so this is why

2591
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:18,040
I chose the most common category I have

2592
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:20,229
in my data set which is the camera

2593
02:25:20,229 --> 02:25:23,500
category so based on this we create a

2594
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:25,810
data set and another set which is the

2595
02:25:25,810 --> 02:25:29,319
wizard set which is the expected result

2596
02:25:29,319 --> 02:25:32,350
set we are going to use to to train this

2597
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:35,950
perceptron and again we scikit-learn we

2598
02:25:35,950 --> 02:25:38,050
create a multi classifier which is a

2599
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:41,020
multi-layer perceptron classifier and we

2600
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:43,800
train this perceptron with this data set

2601
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:48,910
and by doing this we get two things we

2602
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:51,840
get a standard scalar which is used to

2603
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,060
standardize the values of my data set

2604
02:25:55,060 --> 02:25:57,640
and then a perceptron trying perceptron

2605
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:00,069
that can be used later to predict output

2606
02:26:00,069 --> 02:26:04,630
so this two values this perception and

2607
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:06,970
this scalar can be saved for persistence

2608
02:26:06,970 --> 02:26:08,170
on a disk

2609
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:11,380
so I serve this into the camera dog

2610
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:14,350
model file which is the model that can

2611
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:16,450
be used and I tested the accuracy of my

2612
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:19,720
mother which gave me something like 94%

2613
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,290
of success which is not that bad and I

2614
02:26:23,290 --> 02:26:25,060
was pretty amazed by this visit because

2615
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:27,550
I didn't expect that much from this

2616
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:30,609
quick implementation so if the but

2617
02:26:30,609 --> 02:26:33,430
workflow of my my system so first I

2618
02:26:33,430 --> 02:26:36,790
collect data I transform this data into

2619
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:39,729
something compatible with the machine

2620
02:26:39,729 --> 02:26:43,479
running this have unsupervised

2621
02:26:43,479 --> 02:26:44,740
classifier

2622
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:47,410
that will split this data into groups of

2623
02:26:47,410 --> 02:26:49,600
similar items and automatically add

2624
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:55,479
metadata now and then I human validate

2625
02:26:55,479 --> 02:26:58,750
all this information and I can had I can

2626
02:26:58,750 --> 02:27:01,630
add some metadata as well and with the

2627
02:27:01,630 --> 02:27:03,850
all this information we can improve the

2628
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:07,540
models for each category and improve the

2629
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:10,390
classifier as well and we do it again

2630
02:27:10,390 --> 02:27:14,940
with newly collected data so this is

2631
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:18,970
something that is pretty automatic but

2632
02:27:18,970 --> 02:27:22,330
it still requires a human to validate

2633
02:27:22,330 --> 02:27:25,540
all this stuff and check it check if

2634
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:29,370
everything is correct in the database so

2635
02:27:29,370 --> 02:27:33,880
I ran this system on a lot of machines a

2636
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:35,890
lot of services so remember I collected

2637
02:27:35,890 --> 02:27:38,290
almost 5,000 web services osteen on this

2638
02:27:38,290 --> 02:27:43,000
IP addresses my tool add me a lot to

2639
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,280
solve this data you know because my

2640
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,160
classifier was able to group every

2641
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:51,550
single item and I was about to to define

2642
02:27:51,550 --> 02:27:53,560
a lot of categories and a lot of

2643
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:56,950
products in this in this database and

2644
02:27:56,950 --> 02:28:00,880
this is a small data set 5,000 web

2645
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:03,370
services this is not that much but it

2646
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:06,520
seems accurate in a way that I spotted a

2647
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:09,940
lot of various various devices different

2648
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:13,390
services all over the Internet and I

2649
02:28:13,390 --> 02:28:19,330
guess my my wizard are not that bad so

2650
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:22,420
just to sum it up my rotator my input

2651
02:28:22,420 --> 02:28:22,750
data

2652
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:31,060
I have 4895 web services detected I I

2653
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:34,060
run this through my classifiers I was

2654
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:36,729
about to classify or categorize one

2655
02:28:36,729 --> 02:28:38,770
thousand and five hundred and one

2656
02:28:38,770 --> 02:28:42,400
devices my system took three thousand

2657
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:43,750
and one hundred and fifty two

2658
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:47,229
screenshots which is weird because I

2659
02:28:47,229 --> 02:28:48,670
should have the same number of

2660
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:50,290
screenshot that the web services I don't

2661
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:53,110
know what went wrong during my mymy scan

2662
02:28:53,110 --> 02:28:57,040
but in fact something is not did not

2663
02:28:57,040 --> 02:28:58,210
happen as expect

2664
02:28:58,210 --> 02:29:01,390
but anyway and I got 34 megabytes of

2665
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:06,060
HTTP answers from various web services

2666
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:09,040
I'll run this through my classifier and

2667
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:12,910
this is a result by category so this we

2668
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:17,050
have 44% of IP cameras 19% of network

2669
02:29:17,050 --> 02:29:20,170
attached storage 15% of DVR which are

2670
02:29:20,170 --> 02:29:24,280
digital video recorders 11% of returns

2671
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:27,040
9% of ICS nitrous on the wireless

2672
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:29,460
devices and so on so the most popular

2673
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:32,470
categories as we can see exposed on the

2674
02:29:32,470 --> 02:29:36,340
internet by you know my people in their

2675
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:40,660
house our IP cameras and it was network

2676
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:43,210
attached storage and devious so this is

2677
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:47,140
somehow what was expected from the were

2678
02:29:47,140 --> 02:29:51,340
input I looked at this this devices

2679
02:29:51,340 --> 02:29:53,110
during the scanning process and this is

2680
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:55,360
mainly what I saw

2681
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:59,170
so this is this makes sense the top five

2682
02:29:59,170 --> 02:30:02,200
vendors the first one is it vision which

2683
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:05,590
is an IP camera vendor with more than

2684
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:09,370
300 devices the devil which is also give

2685
02:30:09,370 --> 02:30:12,970
you an IP camera vendor and then most

2686
02:30:12,970 --> 02:30:15,310
common most common vendors such as

2687
02:30:15,310 --> 02:30:20,290
SonicWALL tp-link mikrotik which most of

2688
02:30:20,290 --> 02:30:23,050
them are appliances or devices directly

2689
02:30:23,050 --> 02:30:26,200
connected to networks so this makes

2690
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,060
sense but I was surprised by the number

2691
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:31,810
of IP cameras available on the Internet

2692
02:30:31,810 --> 02:30:34,260
also this machine learning classifier

2693
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:37,300
allowed me to to spot a very interesting

2694
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:40,570
thing that in the fact is that this

2695
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:42,160
machine learning classifier was able to

2696
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:48,220
to to group together some devices that

2697
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:52,690
you know from first look like human

2698
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:55,750
won't group together because we got some

2699
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:58,360
device from hikvision here and also

2700
02:30:58,360 --> 02:31:01,120
device from ABS but in fact this is

2701
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,090
something this device is abs and

2702
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:07,570
efficient and so on mainly created by

2703
02:31:07,570 --> 02:31:09,670
vision this is some hardware and

2704
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:12,210
software developed by hey vision but

2705
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:16,090
to other brands in order for them to be

2706
02:31:16,090 --> 02:31:19,181
able to sell IP cameras and so on then

2707
02:31:19,181 --> 02:31:22,210
by using this classifier I was able to

2708
02:31:22,210 --> 02:31:27,010
spot this this fact the fact that vision

2709
02:31:27,010 --> 02:31:31,360
is mostly used but also found on many of

2710
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:34,950
the devices which are quite from some

2711
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:37,480
building automation system available on

2712
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:41,380
the internet some PLC's also winform

2713
02:31:41,380 --> 02:31:43,061
available on the internet something

2714
02:31:43,061 --> 02:31:45,700
we're supposed same question but can

2715
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:47,650
pass with government you know and also a

2716
02:31:47,650 --> 02:31:50,080
French swimming pool that I could have

2717
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:52,660
interacted with the settings of the

2718
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:54,730
swimming pool and yeah there's some

2719
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:57,730
nasty stuff and the last part of this

2720
02:31:57,730 --> 02:31:59,410
presentation we talked about we are

2721
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:00,670
going to I am going to talk about

2722
02:32:00,670 --> 02:32:01,540
weaponizing

2723
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:04,570
weaponizing this stuff the first thing

2724
02:32:04,570 --> 02:32:06,221
is that you canyou is machine allocate

2725
02:32:06,221 --> 02:32:08,320
machine learning to target devices you

2726
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:10,960
know instead of just doing some scanner

2727
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:13,510
matching some patterns and this is what

2728
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:17,110
I've done I did a specific perception I

2729
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:19,630
created a perception to detect security

2730
02:32:19,630 --> 02:32:22,420
cameras and by doing this I can spot the

2731
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:24,221
cameras available on the internet so

2732
02:32:24,221 --> 02:32:27,790
let's have a look at it so this is a

2733
02:32:27,790 --> 02:32:30,670
specific range with a lot of cameras on

2734
02:32:30,670 --> 02:32:34,450
and as you can see this this little tool

2735
02:32:34,450 --> 02:32:38,110
uses a specific model of design based on

2736
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:40,540
the camera category and then if I take

2737
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:46,510
one of these like this one of of this

2738
02:32:46,510 --> 02:32:52,271
device just wait a minute we can see

2739
02:32:52,271 --> 02:32:59,670
that these devices are mostly cameras

2740
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:10,240
yeah so this is this is the this other

2741
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:13,300
one is another camera and so on so this

2742
02:33:13,300 --> 02:33:16,000
system this camera is able to spot

2743
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,800
cameras based on this machine learning

2744
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:24,930
so I have no I I don't need to

2745
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:27,419
to implement some pattern matching

2746
02:33:27,419 --> 02:33:30,239
algorithm this is created based on the

2747
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:33,119
collected data I get from my system so

2748
02:33:33,119 --> 02:33:35,430
basically you can then J locate camera

2749
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:38,130
feeds create a map of camera feeds

2750
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:40,319
available try also different username

2751
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:42,149
and passwords and you can do the same

2752
02:33:42,149 --> 02:33:44,520
with network attached storage find

2753
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,619
default password and still data and so

2754
02:33:46,619 --> 02:33:50,069
on so this is very easy to base from

2755
02:33:50,069 --> 02:33:52,470
this disk and this classifier to know

2756
02:33:52,470 --> 02:33:57,409
exactly how to target a range of devices

2757
02:33:57,409 --> 02:34:00,060
you're looking for queuing up for

2758
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:02,579
instance you can use try to exploit the

2759
02:34:02,579 --> 02:34:04,919
latest vulnerability which is a pre

2760
02:34:04,919 --> 02:34:09,140
authenticated good remote code execution

2761
02:34:09,140 --> 02:34:12,239
you can also create a perceptron and

2762
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:14,909
train a model to detect QNAP Nass as

2763
02:34:14,909 --> 02:34:17,100
well so it's very easy to create a

2764
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:19,949
specific Search and Destroy robot based

2765
02:34:19,949 --> 02:34:23,579
on the data we collected before so as a

2766
02:34:23,579 --> 02:34:26,459
conclusion machine learning is great I

2767
02:34:26,459 --> 02:34:29,369
didn't expect such a result from this

2768
02:34:29,369 --> 02:34:31,859
little experiment I made but this

2769
02:34:31,859 --> 02:34:35,279
unsupervised classifier made my day you

2770
02:34:35,279 --> 02:34:37,020
know because it was very easy to

2771
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:40,499
classify all these data all these all

2772
02:34:40,499 --> 02:34:44,249
these devices I detected metal your

2773
02:34:44,249 --> 02:34:46,079
perceptron also provides an easy way to

2774
02:34:46,079 --> 02:34:47,939
create targeted tools and to create a

2775
02:34:47,939 --> 02:34:50,970
specific scanners as well by just

2776
02:34:50,970 --> 02:34:54,359
observing the various devices out there

2777
02:34:54,359 --> 02:34:57,590
and we can derive from these devices

2778
02:34:57,590 --> 02:35:01,260
some specific scanners without having to

2779
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:02,909
implement some pattern matching

2780
02:35:02,909 --> 02:35:05,459
algorithm or so on and but the fact is

2781
02:35:05,459 --> 02:35:09,079
that human is still awake rabid because

2782
02:35:09,079 --> 02:35:12,029
it's a unit or to interact with this

2783
02:35:12,029 --> 02:35:15,239
automatic system to drive it to guide

2784
02:35:15,239 --> 02:35:17,550
the system toward the goal you want to

2785
02:35:17,550 --> 02:35:19,919
achieve so this is something quite

2786
02:35:19,919 --> 02:35:22,140
interesting about machinery so if you

2787
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:24,090
want to give a try to machine learning

2788
02:35:24,090 --> 02:35:26,939
by using Python and scikit-learn this is

2789
02:35:26,939 --> 02:35:28,800
very very interesting

2790
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:32,010
also you can if you want to reproduce my

2791
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:34,780
experiment you may use

2792
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:36,730
although Python libraries such as

2793
02:35:36,730 --> 02:35:40,390
request whooshes sequel like three but

2794
02:35:40,390 --> 02:35:42,310
the most difficult part I think is

2795
02:35:42,310 --> 02:35:44,680
picking the right features and bidding

2796
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:48,400
the correct data sets since all the

2797
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:51,670
algorithm are already in implementing in

2798
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:56,170
these libraries the the how that hardest

2799
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:59,290
part is to correctly choose the

2800
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:01,600
information you are going to use for

2801
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,080
this automatic learning so I won't

2802
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:07,300
release any source code because well

2803
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:09,250
first my code is quite dirty you know

2804
02:36:09,250 --> 02:36:13,810
it's just an experiment I didn't plan to

2805
02:36:13,810 --> 02:36:16,090
release it and all the key matter is

2806
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:17,920
provided in this presentation you get

2807
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,290
the code snippets all the parameters are

2808
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:22,420
used and so on and I learned a lot

2809
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:24,130
during this project so will you if you

2810
02:36:24,130 --> 02:36:28,240
try to do this experiment by yourself so

2811
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:30,730
thank you for listening and I hope you

2812
02:36:30,730 --> 02:36:32,890
enjoyed the talk and remember discover

2813
02:36:32,890 --> 02:36:37,769
new things experiment and down thank you

2814
02:36:45,150 --> 02:36:55,390
okay thanks rats for people watching

2815
02:36:55,390 --> 02:37:01,770
I can ask by using the did you try

2816
02:37:01,770 --> 02:37:05,530
several million of multi-layer

2817
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:18,370
perceptron sorry did you owe me yeah yes

2818
02:37:18,370 --> 02:37:22,750
so I tried some different models the

2819
02:37:22,750 --> 02:37:26,740
model I'm using in my my tool is bait on

2820
02:37:26,740 --> 02:37:29,350
three hidden layers this is a

2821
02:37:29,350 --> 02:37:32,050
multi-layer perception but in fact I

2822
02:37:32,050 --> 02:37:34,660
tried the classical perception as well

2823
02:37:34,660 --> 02:37:38,290
but it didn't give me very good results

2824
02:37:38,290 --> 02:37:42,010
so I I tried you know just like a lot of

2825
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:45,310
people I saw in mini tutorials over the

2826
02:37:45,310 --> 02:37:45,820
Internet

2827
02:37:45,820 --> 02:37:47,780
I tried mean many

2828
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:50,320
and configurations for perceptrons and

2829
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:55,400
until one gave me good reasons but the

2830
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:57,920
multi-layer classifier material

2831
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:00,681
perceptron classifier available in

2832
02:38:00,681 --> 02:38:04,221
scikit-learn with a few hidden layers

2833
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:06,380
did the trick

2834
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:09,011
but I think this can be improved as well

2835
02:38:09,011 --> 02:38:12,650
using some maybe some other

2836
02:38:12,650 --> 02:38:15,530
configurations of a different number of

2837
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:19,250
layers of neurons I don't know this was

2838
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:21,771
just like I said an experiment from from

2839
02:38:21,771 --> 02:38:25,521
my side so I tried to to trick the

2840
02:38:25,521 --> 02:38:29,931
system in a way it gave me the pretty

2841
02:38:29,931 --> 02:38:31,960
good results not the best ones but

2842
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:44,030
almost good visit ok other question will

2843
02:38:44,030 --> 02:38:50,351
do very little wretch maybe on the next

2844
02:38:50,351 --> 02:38:52,700
presentation will be in two minutes

2845
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:55,511
thanks a lot

2846
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:12,860
[Music]

2847
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:04,990
the possessive so we are going to have

2848
02:40:04,990 --> 02:40:09,910
our layers last talk this talk is about

2849
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:11,141
IOT

2850
02:40:11,141 --> 02:40:14,320
it's an annuity using the medical

2851
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:19,360
purpose in order to detect yeah bet so

2852
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:22,210
the last presentation will be done by

2853
02:40:22,210 --> 02:40:29,110
Excel a provider would relax here on the

2854
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:34,811
Travis Wood Street explain yeah yeah and

2855
02:40:34,811 --> 02:40:38,110
normally this is here as well and you

2856
02:40:38,110 --> 02:40:42,970
starting up okay can you show you a

2857
02:40:42,970 --> 02:40:45,130
presentation yeah you have the

2858
02:40:45,130 --> 02:40:47,410
presentation how's the presentation but

2859
02:40:47,410 --> 02:40:51,061
of course I can as well of course

2860
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,060
you

2861
02:41:38,300 --> 02:41:40,230
you

2862
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:42,289
you

2863
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:48,239
can you see my screen yep can you

2864
02:41:48,239 --> 02:41:53,640
control my screen um I am NOT trying to

2865
02:41:53,640 --> 02:42:01,739
no yeah but I'll do it on my own sides

2866
02:42:01,739 --> 02:42:07,560
Travis keep control on your own computer

2867
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:12,229
and I'll keep control on mine okay

2868
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:33,539
all right are we ready to go

2869
02:42:34,620 --> 02:42:37,720
we've got your slides right mom yeah we

2870
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:38,800
don't have your slides

2871
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:41,680
oh there it's coming I think oh no maybe

2872
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:57,400
not no I see only Philip okay maybe you

2873
02:42:57,400 --> 02:43:05,650
can shout okay perfect all right and you

2874
02:43:05,650 --> 02:43:14,950
still see them yep today I will be

2875
02:43:14,950 --> 02:43:20,800
talking to you about embedded glucose

2876
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:24,430
sensors these are tiny little sensors

2877
02:43:24,430 --> 02:43:27,490
that you stick on top of your skin while

2878
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:30,310
injecting the wire underneath the skin

2879
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:33,040
that allows you to wirelessly measure

2880
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:35,770
your blood glucose from an android phone

2881
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:39,220
or a dedicated reader over the course of

2882
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:41,980
10 days to two weeks in order to manage

2883
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:43,830
diabetes without having to repeatedly

2884
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:47,500
prick your finger playing with these for

2885
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:51,450
about a year now even some change and

2886
02:43:51,450 --> 02:43:53,470
we've discovered a bunch of fun stuff

2887
02:43:53,470 --> 02:43:56,050
such as remote code execution inside of

2888
02:43:56,050 --> 02:43:58,360
the sensors themselves we've dumped the

2889
02:43:58,360 --> 02:44:00,370
firmware of the sensors in order to be

2890
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:01,900
able to reverse engineer and patch them

2891
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:04,150
and today we're going to be talking

2892
02:44:04,150 --> 02:44:06,820
about how to bypass the restrictions

2893
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:08,620
which are artificially added to these

2894
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:13,230
medical devices in order to enforce the

2895
02:44:13,230 --> 02:44:15,580
regulatory lifetime of the device and

2896
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:20,200
also the region lock so we'll be showing

2897
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:21,880
you how to take a sensor which is

2898
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:24,850
expired and then bring it back from the

2899
02:44:24,850 --> 02:44:26,170
dead and use it to continue measuring

2900
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:28,900
we'll also to show you how to take a

2901
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:32,230
sensor from one region such as France

2902
02:44:32,230 --> 02:44:33,970
for example and move it to another

2903
02:44:33,970 --> 02:44:37,180
region such as the United States where

2904
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:38,800
the classic sensors are no longer

2905
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:41,580
available for sale

2906
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:46,570
cool

2907
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:53,411
yep so I worked for Fortinet and I'm

2908
02:44:53,411 --> 02:44:56,121
mobile malware researcher there I saw

2909
02:44:56,121 --> 02:44:58,671
look for malware on mobile phones and on

2910
02:44:58,671 --> 02:45:04,610
IOT and also I organized a CTF which is

2911
02:45:04,610 --> 02:45:06,440
called phone and which is dedicated to

2912
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:10,671
smart devices and that's all your turn

2913
02:45:10,671 --> 02:45:18,711
Travis I collect old cars called

2914
02:45:18,711 --> 02:45:20,931
Studebakers which were the very last

2915
02:45:20,931 --> 02:45:23,030
American programmed to die with dignity

2916
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:31,911
I also made a project and I had a

2917
02:45:31,911 --> 02:45:33,711
journal along with some other folks

2918
02:45:33,711 --> 02:45:35,241
called the International Journal of

2919
02:45:35,241 --> 02:45:38,511
concept you get the out and I'm

2920
02:45:38,511 --> 02:45:40,280
happy to say that yesterday I turned in

2921
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:42,021
the final pages for our third volume

2922
02:45:42,021 --> 02:45:49,091
which should be available this year yep

2923
02:45:49,091 --> 02:45:53,601
mmm so Oh perhaps switch to my own

2924
02:45:53,601 --> 02:45:59,181
slides and share my screen Travis can

2925
02:45:59,181 --> 02:46:00,831
you stop sharing your screen please

2926
02:46:00,831 --> 02:46:02,931
yes let's stick with your is for the

2927
02:46:02,931 --> 02:46:04,881
remainder of the presentation and then

2928
02:46:04,881 --> 02:46:08,201
you can set the pace okay no problem

2929
02:46:08,201 --> 02:46:15,980
there we go so um those little devices

2930
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:20,721
are are called flash glucose monitoring

2931
02:46:20,721 --> 02:46:25,671
systems they are used to to get the

2932
02:46:25,671 --> 02:46:27,650
glucose level for people who have

2933
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:34,780
diabetes do not inject any insulin oh

2934
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:41,171
sure my screen is not being shared sorry

2935
02:46:45,701 --> 02:46:47,710
yep

2936
02:46:47,710 --> 02:46:53,569
there we go okay and that should be far

2937
02:46:53,569 --> 02:47:00,250
better yeah you see that that time sorry

2938
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:03,290
so I was saying that what is important

2939
02:47:03,290 --> 02:47:07,370
is that those senses are passive in the

2940
02:47:07,370 --> 02:47:09,740
sense that they are not injecting any

2941
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:12,920
insulin they just will tell you your

2942
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:15,710
current level of glucose the other thing

2943
02:47:15,710 --> 02:47:17,240
but I'm not going to get into the

2944
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:19,300
details but that was what's this

2945
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:23,210
research document was about is that it

2946
02:47:23,210 --> 02:47:26,120
is actually not getting the glucose

2947
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:29,330
level from blood vessels but from the

2948
02:47:29,330 --> 02:47:31,729
interstitial tissues and basically the

2949
02:47:31,729 --> 02:47:35,210
upper layers of skin and well this has

2950
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:39,109
been proved to be relatively accurate to

2951
02:47:39,109 --> 02:47:42,229
measure to measure once a glucose level

2952
02:47:42,229 --> 02:47:46,220
and for for science I tested as you can

2953
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:49,580
see this those sensors on myself though

2954
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:53,410
actually I don't have diabetes at all

2955
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:56,810
well it doesn't hurt to put it on but

2956
02:47:56,810 --> 02:47:58,910
it's very difficult to get it out to get

2957
02:47:58,910 --> 02:48:02,149
it off so what we're mostly interested

2958
02:48:02,149 --> 02:48:07,100
in today is actually this the life of

2959
02:48:07,100 --> 02:48:09,890
those sensor at first when you buy them

2960
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:13,540
in a pharmacy they come like that yeah

2961
02:48:13,540 --> 02:48:16,430
disassembled in a package where you have

2962
02:48:16,430 --> 02:48:19,189
one part which has actually the

2963
02:48:19,189 --> 02:48:22,040
electronics parts and in the flyer

2964
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:24,410
something like that and here you've got

2965
02:48:24,410 --> 02:48:29,600
the enzyme sensor which is in a sterile

2966
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:31,910
pack so you've got to assemble

2967
02:48:31,910 --> 02:48:33,649
everything then

2968
02:48:33,649 --> 02:48:36,979
but it's apply it on your arm and then

2969
02:48:36,979 --> 02:48:42,560
you use your smartphone there and well

2970
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:45,950
you scan the sensor and it tells you

2971
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:49,670
well you have for instance a warm up

2972
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:53,840
period of 60 minutes this warmup period

2973
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:56,450
length depends actually on the country

2974
02:48:56,450 --> 02:48:59,240
where you live a you you live and after

2975
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:00,950
those 60 minutes

2976
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:03,200
well it will tell you okay it will

2977
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:05,360
decide that the sensor has warmed up

2978
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:07,939
enough and is giving normally good

2979
02:49:07,939 --> 02:49:11,090
results accurate results and you can use

2980
02:49:11,090 --> 02:49:15,260
it then you can use it for 14 days

2981
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:20,390
again this is limits that you that

2982
02:49:20,390 --> 02:49:23,060
actually depends on the country and 14

2983
02:49:23,060 --> 02:49:26,030
days 14 days later

2984
02:49:26,030 --> 02:49:29,090
well the sensor expires and you've gotta

2985
02:49:29,090 --> 02:49:32,260
go to go and buy another one

2986
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:37,280
right so as you can see there are quite

2987
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:39,410
a couple of limitations there right

2988
02:49:39,410 --> 02:49:43,880
we've got the lifetime of the sensor 14

2989
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:47,090
days in our case okay this is one

2990
02:49:47,090 --> 02:49:50,000
limitation another one is the warmup

2991
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,400
time so we said it was in our case sixty

2992
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:55,580
minutes okay this is also something that

2993
02:49:55,580 --> 02:49:58,760
we're going to try to hatch and the

2994
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:01,550
final limitation is perhaps not obvious

2995
02:50:01,550 --> 02:50:05,330
to you but actually the senses are zones

2996
02:50:05,330 --> 02:50:09,110
just like a DVD kind of so if you buy

2997
02:50:09,110 --> 02:50:12,650
one sensor in the US and you want to use

2998
02:50:12,650 --> 02:50:15,470
it with an application or mobile

2999
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:17,930
application of Europe it is not going to

3000
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:20,000
work it will complain and receive

3001
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,640
broccoli so we're going to work around

3002
02:50:22,640 --> 02:50:25,340
all those limitations and distal and

3003
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:29,689
show you that yeah of course at this

3004
02:50:29,689 --> 02:50:33,050
time for at least a disclaimer there we

3005
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:35,960
have tested all of this on the technical

3006
02:50:35,960 --> 02:50:38,840
side of course we are not medical

3007
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:42,320
vectors and we have not done any medical

3008
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:44,930
research on this point of view so well

3009
02:50:44,930 --> 02:50:47,330
we kind of discouraged you strongly to

3010
02:50:47,330 --> 02:50:50,479
play with these those as we can remind

3011
02:50:50,479 --> 02:50:54,740
our medical devices of course okay the

3012
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:56,660
important point though is that of course

3013
02:50:56,660 --> 02:50:58,760
an attacker could do what we are doing

3014
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:05,350
so it has also some relevance let's say

3015
02:51:05,350 --> 02:51:08,960
so we will directly go to the

3016
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:11,180
resurrection demo so just a few words

3017
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:13,760
before I try and do this then

3018
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:20,239
life those those sensor the they expire

3019
02:51:20,239 --> 02:51:26,810
after the felt 14 days right the goal of

3020
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:29,090
the resurrection demo is to reset them

3021
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:31,880
so that once they have expired

3022
02:51:31,880 --> 02:51:35,329
they are basically dead well we can

3023
02:51:35,329 --> 02:51:37,579
bring them back to life and we can reuse

3024
02:51:37,579 --> 02:51:40,520
them again for as long as we wish or at

3025
02:51:40,520 --> 02:51:43,670
least 14 days again okay

3026
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:49,069
so now I am going to stop sharing the

3027
02:51:49,069 --> 02:51:51,079
screen here and share it on my

3028
02:51:51,079 --> 02:52:03,619
smartphone so there we go there and I

3029
02:52:03,619 --> 02:52:08,149
you see here the screen of my smartphone

3030
02:52:08,149 --> 02:52:11,590
and I'm gonna switch to another camera

3031
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:15,439
so that you can see if you have a look

3032
02:52:15,439 --> 02:52:16,999
on Zoom

3033
02:52:16,999 --> 02:52:19,340
well the sensors here that I am funny

3034
02:52:19,340 --> 02:52:23,180
with so first of all I'm going to show

3035
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:25,939
you that this sensor has expired

3036
02:52:25,939 --> 02:52:33,590
um there we go so I scan it and it tells

3037
02:52:33,590 --> 02:52:36,109
you sorry it has disappeared a bit too

3038
02:52:36,109 --> 02:52:40,789
fast that the sensor has expired found

3039
02:52:40,789 --> 02:52:44,420
you kept in French okay so we have

3040
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:48,260
actually implemented an application good

3041
02:52:48,260 --> 02:52:53,659
V and which can help us do the hack this

3042
02:52:53,659 --> 02:52:55,069
first thing we're going to read the

3043
02:52:55,069 --> 02:53:01,819
status of of the sensor and it tells us

3044
02:53:01,819 --> 02:53:05,119
you can see see it in the middle stage

3045
02:53:05,119 --> 02:53:11,140
expired we reset it erase

3046
02:53:14,409 --> 02:53:17,239
successfully erased AG everything is

3047
02:53:17,239 --> 02:53:20,800
good up to now and now we are going to

3048
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:24,050
try and see if it is really back to life

3049
02:53:24,050 --> 02:53:26,930
again and we try to use it with the

3050
02:53:26,930 --> 02:53:32,270
official application and yeah it worked

3051
02:53:32,270 --> 02:53:35,270
okay so this sensor is going to be

3052
02:53:35,270 --> 02:53:39,709
operational and 60 minutes we brought it

3053
02:53:39,709 --> 02:53:43,340
back to life that way so that's it for

3054
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:46,369
this demonstration and now I can stop

3055
02:53:46,369 --> 02:53:48,319
sharing the screen here and go back to

3056
02:53:48,319 --> 02:54:01,100
the slides the only thing missing from

3057
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:03,949
it is the vendors backdoor command or

3058
02:54:03,949 --> 02:54:06,020
the password for the backdoor command

3059
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:08,510
use their four bytes you can find them

3060
02:54:08,510 --> 02:54:12,680
in other packages that are not lying

3061
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:22,729
patch them in and run this up okay do

3062
02:54:22,729 --> 02:54:26,689
you see the slides correctly yes okay

3063
02:54:26,689 --> 02:54:31,850
it's your your go Travis okay so the way

3064
02:54:31,850 --> 02:54:34,119
that this application works is by

3065
02:54:34,119 --> 02:54:39,819
communicating with the tag using the

3066
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:43,329
using the vendor proprietary commands

3067
02:54:43,329 --> 02:54:46,159
which are implemented as a combination

3068
02:54:46,159 --> 02:54:49,369
of mask ROM which is permanently a part

3069
02:54:49,369 --> 02:54:52,039
of the chip and identical between all

3070
02:54:52,039 --> 02:54:56,569
tank versions and FM which is a unique

3071
02:54:56,569 --> 02:55:00,169
type of memory that's sort of new to

3072
02:55:00,169 --> 02:55:03,499
this chip and commercially it's almost

3073
02:55:03,499 --> 02:55:07,880
unique to Texas Instruments FM uses very

3074
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:10,550
little power and it is very cheap -

3075
02:55:10,550 --> 02:55:17,119
right - so it's like SRAM in that way in

3076
02:55:17,119 --> 02:55:21,169
that you can write to it over the NFC

3077
02:55:21,169 --> 02:55:23,119
Channel without requiring the high

3078
02:55:23,119 --> 02:55:26,199
voltage is necessary for flash memory

3079
02:55:26,199 --> 02:55:27,940
but at the same time

3080
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:30,010
it's non-volatile when power is removed

3081
02:55:30,010 --> 02:55:32,351
so even though this particular device

3082
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:34,990
has had the battery taken out of it the

3083
02:55:34,990 --> 02:55:37,720
contents of that efrem remain the same

3084
02:55:37,720 --> 02:55:41,950
and this allows for firmware patches to

3085
02:55:41,950 --> 02:55:48,851
be applied to an unpowered NFC sensor so

3086
02:55:48,851 --> 02:55:51,490
what we did was we took the publicly

3087
02:55:51,490 --> 02:55:54,700
visible portion of the memory which is

3088
02:55:54,700 --> 02:55:57,400
the F RAM we read that out and then we

3089
02:55:57,400 --> 02:55:59,980
reverse engineered it well enough to

3090
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:03,280
understand its protocol we combined that

3091
02:56:03,280 --> 02:56:06,101
with sniffed transactions from the

3092
02:56:06,101 --> 02:56:08,620
Android app and we're able to identify

3093
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:12,250
the password and the usage convention

3094
02:56:12,250 --> 02:56:14,530
for a command that dumped out all of

3095
02:56:14,530 --> 02:56:17,920
memory this command is a robbery you

3096
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:20,950
give it an address in the 16-bit address

3097
02:56:20,950 --> 02:56:23,021
space of the microcontroller and it

3098
02:56:23,021 --> 02:56:25,780
dumps out all of the firm with that we

3099
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:27,400
were able to load the firmware into

3100
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:30,101
kitra and beat them higher and then

3101
02:56:30,101 --> 02:56:31,840
understand everything that happens

3102
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:34,300
inside of the sensor this is not quite

3103
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:36,851
the same as understanding everything

3104
02:56:36,851 --> 02:56:39,311
that's used in the device because half

3105
02:56:39,311 --> 02:56:41,620
of the logic is held within the sensor

3106
02:56:41,620 --> 02:56:44,170
while the other half of the logic is

3107
02:56:44,170 --> 02:56:48,641
inside of the Android app so as it was

3108
02:56:48,641 --> 02:56:51,700
about four or five months ago we were

3109
02:56:51,700 --> 02:56:53,980
able to patch the code running inside of

3110
02:56:53,980 --> 02:56:55,300
the sensor we were able to patch the

3111
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:57,430
data we were able to change a state we

3112
02:56:57,430 --> 02:56:59,050
were able to remove the right

3113
02:56:59,050 --> 02:57:02,351
protections on sensitive regions but we

3114
02:57:02,351 --> 02:57:07,030
didn't quite understand the of all

3115
02:57:07,030 --> 02:57:10,210
things the CRC check sum the verified

3116
02:57:10,210 --> 02:57:12,370
that this data was accurate and so

3117
02:57:12,370 --> 02:57:14,470
without changing that CRC check sum

3118
02:57:14,470 --> 02:57:18,880
correctly when the when the tag went

3119
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:20,920
back to the app the app would see the

3120
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:23,470
data see that the checksum was wrong and

3121
02:57:23,470 --> 02:57:27,160
then know that the sensor was invalid

3122
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:30,480
and tampered with rejected

3123
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:42,091
the other thing you see here is on the

3124
02:57:42,091 --> 02:57:44,971
top left under the program tree you'll

3125
02:57:44,971 --> 02:57:47,341
see that there's a ROM section an SRAM

3126
02:57:47,341 --> 02:57:51,480
section and an FM section a big piece of

3127
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:54,120
how this code works is that the FM is

3128
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:55,740
touching the ground while not being

3129
02:57:55,740 --> 02:57:59,580
apart so there is a large table of

3130
02:57:59,580 --> 02:58:02,250
function pointers inside of SRAM that

3131
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:04,011
are used to facilitate this linking

3132
02:58:04,011 --> 02:58:06,931
which are initialized at start up by the

3133
02:58:06,931 --> 02:58:09,690
ROM this is the same patching procedure

3134
02:58:09,690 --> 02:58:11,641
that was used by the original Palm Pilot

3135
02:58:11,641 --> 02:58:20,070
and Avenue if you'd like to read more

3136
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:22,980
about the firmware and take a look at

3137
02:58:22,980 --> 02:58:26,130
our pocket read UFO article but for now

3138
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:27,570
we're going to talk about the easier

3139
02:58:27,570 --> 02:58:31,700
command and the the easier command is

3140
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:36,511
disabled in that the Ephrem has a list

3141
02:58:36,511 --> 02:58:40,740
of new commands which are hooked by the

3142
02:58:40,740 --> 02:58:44,221
patches against the mask ROM and the

3143
02:58:44,221 --> 02:58:49,920
list is edited early in that the the

3144
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:52,710
table has a start marker and an end

3145
02:58:52,710 --> 02:58:55,650
marker and the end marker comes early as

3146
02:58:55,650 --> 02:58:57,330
part of how the chip is locked as it

3147
02:58:57,330 --> 02:59:00,391
beats the factory so we can see that

3148
02:59:00,391 --> 02:59:04,830
this code existed we can see that it

3149
02:59:04,830 --> 02:59:07,500
called back into mass ROM and having a

3150
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:09,841
dump of the mass from we can see the

3151
02:59:09,841 --> 02:59:12,870
function that it called which you see

3152
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:16,230
here on the right in the screenshot at 5

3153
02:59:16,230 --> 02:59:18,841
to 5 6 in mass ROM and we can see that

3154
02:59:18,841 --> 02:59:20,940
it resets the center the sensor we could

3155
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:24,091
disassemble it and it allowed us to

3156
02:59:24,091 --> 02:59:26,820
understand some of these fields that

3157
02:59:26,820 --> 02:59:30,601
were held like there's a little variable

3158
02:59:30,601 --> 02:59:33,061
inside of the code that stores the stage

3159
02:59:33,061 --> 02:59:36,061
of life and it's 0 when it's inactive

3160
02:59:36,061 --> 02:59:38,800
it's 1 when you're activating it freezes

3161
02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:42,850
rational 5 as it expires 6 if it dies an

3162
02:59:42,850 --> 02:59:45,189
early death such as there's a power

3163
02:59:45,189 --> 02:59:48,310
failure where if the values that it's

3164
02:59:48,310 --> 02:59:50,050
reading are so nonsensical that it has

3165
02:59:50,050 --> 02:59:53,140
to be damaged and each of these sections

3166
02:59:53,140 --> 02:59:56,080
is separately protected by a CRC we can

3167
02:59:56,080 --> 02:59:58,780
even see the code calling into the CRC

3168
02:59:58,780 --> 03:00:02,260
peripheral to compute this checksum and

3169
03:00:02,260 --> 03:00:04,390
at one point we were almost desperate

3170
03:00:04,390 --> 03:00:07,630
enough to write a program which would

3171
03:00:07,630 --> 03:00:10,420
run inside of a modified sensor just to

3172
03:00:10,420 --> 03:00:12,340
calculate CRC's for us by having the

3173
03:00:12,340 --> 03:00:14,859
phone send all of the data into the chip

3174
03:00:14,859 --> 03:00:21,550
and then read back the result so to

3175
03:00:21,550 --> 03:00:24,340
reset a sensor as far as the firmware is

3176
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:26,620
concerned you just need to set the stage

3177
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:28,540
of life bite and you need to set the

3178
03:00:28,540 --> 03:00:30,880
activity switch bike so that it believes

3179
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:34,000
that it's ready to be used but hasn't

3180
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:35,950
been used yet and then you also need to

3181
03:00:35,950 --> 03:00:39,609
format the record section so that it

3182
03:00:39,609 --> 03:00:41,170
doesn't believe that it's gone through

3183
03:00:41,170 --> 03:00:44,350
any amount of active life time and all

3184
03:00:44,350 --> 03:00:46,120
of these are in FM writing to them is

3185
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:50,950
just as easy as writing to ram but you

3186
03:00:50,950 --> 03:01:00,120
need that searcy to be correct yep this

3187
03:01:00,120 --> 03:01:02,950
yelled stop from here and saw a switch

3188
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:13,050
to another camera and there we go yep

3189
03:01:20,109 --> 03:01:23,930
there we go so yeah computing is CRC

3190
03:01:23,930 --> 03:01:25,550
sure than being difficult right it's

3191
03:01:25,550 --> 03:01:28,249
just a checksum with two bytes in in

3192
03:01:28,249 --> 03:01:31,609
this particular case but well which one

3193
03:01:31,609 --> 03:01:34,249
is it we hadn't realized they were so

3194
03:01:34,249 --> 03:01:36,739
many okay so many different CRC's

3195
03:01:36,739 --> 03:01:39,199
existing little slight little variants

3196
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:40,189
and things like that

3197
03:01:40,189 --> 03:01:44,270
so we tried them all and none matched

3198
03:01:44,270 --> 03:01:49,579
the the sensor so to be honest at this

3199
03:01:49,579 --> 03:01:51,350
part well we were a colonel

3200
03:01:51,350 --> 03:01:53,239
yes what's Travis ed a little bit

3201
03:01:53,239 --> 03:01:56,029
desperate there and several months

3202
03:01:56,029 --> 03:02:00,560
passed before we understood the silly

3203
03:02:00,560 --> 03:02:04,869
solution of course we bumped into a a

3204
03:02:04,869 --> 03:02:08,210
for a month of Texas Instruments chips

3205
03:02:08,210 --> 03:02:10,760
and somebody was asking exactly the same

3206
03:02:10,760 --> 03:02:13,489
question was saying well you know I'm

3207
03:02:13,489 --> 03:02:16,970
trying to do this checksum there and no

3208
03:02:16,970 --> 03:02:18,979
way I'm not getting the correct results

3209
03:02:18,979 --> 03:02:23,390
and the answer was well the CRC module

3210
03:02:23,390 --> 03:02:25,550
is shifting the bits in the opposite

3211
03:02:25,550 --> 03:02:30,229
direction of CRC 16 ccitt okay we hadn't

3212
03:02:30,229 --> 03:02:31,970
thought about that the opposite

3213
03:02:31,970 --> 03:02:34,850
direction we had tried to fill all the

3214
03:02:34,850 --> 03:02:38,090
memory input with zeros we had tried to

3215
03:02:38,090 --> 03:02:40,579
fill it with FF we had tried plenty of

3216
03:02:40,579 --> 03:02:43,430
different different solutions but not

3217
03:02:43,430 --> 03:02:46,899
that and of course we we weren't able to

3218
03:02:46,899 --> 03:02:50,329
recompute this year sync correctly with

3219
03:02:50,329 --> 03:02:52,909
that once you know it's just well the

3220
03:02:52,909 --> 03:02:53,869
opposite direction

3221
03:02:53,869 --> 03:02:56,060
well you just implemented and we were

3222
03:02:56,060 --> 03:02:59,210
able at that stage to recompute any CRC

3223
03:02:59,210 --> 03:03:03,260
and therefore to fool the sensor and to

3224
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:05,510
believe that it's memory was absolutely

3225
03:03:05,510 --> 03:03:10,460
correct so well you saw in a video that

3226
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:14,960
we were able to do resurrection well if

3227
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:17,840
we have the power to reset the sensor we

3228
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:20,210
obviously have the opposite power which

3229
03:03:20,210 --> 03:03:23,779
is to kill it right it's just a simple

3230
03:03:23,779 --> 03:03:25,699
you probably have understood how we will

3231
03:03:25,699 --> 03:03:28,550
do it we will just shift the stage of

3232
03:03:28,550 --> 03:03:32,600
life bytes to expired value which is

3233
03:03:32,600 --> 03:03:33,529
five or six

3234
03:03:33,529 --> 03:03:36,409
which is error that's one way to do it

3235
03:03:36,409 --> 03:03:39,260
the other way to do it is just to room

3236
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:44,510
one of the CRC's or one one bite when

3237
03:03:44,510 --> 03:03:46,850
single bytes in the Sansa so that the

3238
03:03:46,850 --> 03:03:50,060
CRC's no longer match in that case the

3239
03:03:50,060 --> 03:03:52,850
application when it reads the sensor it

3240
03:03:52,850 --> 03:03:54,919
will notice that the CRC's are not

3241
03:03:54,919 --> 03:03:57,709
matching and it complains and says your

3242
03:03:57,709 --> 03:04:01,159
sensor is corrupt go and gets another

3243
03:04:01,159 --> 03:04:03,279
one

3244
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:10,039
so we hacked the life time of the

3245
03:04:10,039 --> 03:04:12,939
sensors those fourteen days we also said

3246
03:04:12,939 --> 03:04:16,310
that we would hack the warm up time ok

3247
03:04:16,310 --> 03:04:18,979
those 60 minutes at the beginning before

3248
03:04:18,979 --> 03:04:22,249
the sensor is actually usable so for

3249
03:04:22,249 --> 03:04:24,949
this one we are going to show you this

3250
03:04:24,949 --> 03:04:28,039
time video but the setup is the

3251
03:04:28,039 --> 03:04:29,600
following

3252
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:33,319
we are going to use actually frida you

3253
03:04:33,319 --> 03:04:34,879
probably have heard of that which is

3254
03:04:34,879 --> 03:04:38,529
going to help us install a hook on the

3255
03:04:38,529 --> 03:04:40,459
application the official application

3256
03:04:40,459 --> 03:04:42,890
which is used to communicate with the

3257
03:04:42,890 --> 03:04:47,989
sensor by NFC we are going to hook the

3258
03:04:47,989 --> 03:04:51,409
exact functions which actually retrieve

3259
03:04:51,409 --> 03:04:54,350
the limits for the well warm up time and

3260
03:04:54,350 --> 03:04:57,169
also for the wear time and other and

3261
03:04:57,169 --> 03:05:01,039
other stuff right an instead of reading

3262
03:05:01,039 --> 03:05:03,859
here 60 minutes for the warm up time

3263
03:05:03,859 --> 03:05:05,779
we're going to modify this and say I

3264
03:05:05,779 --> 03:05:07,729
don't know I want to warm up of five

3265
03:05:07,729 --> 03:05:09,919
minutes I want to warm up of two minutes

3266
03:05:09,919 --> 03:05:15,609
and this is how it's going to work so

3267
03:05:15,609 --> 03:05:25,819
I've got to switch to the video we are

3268
03:05:25,819 --> 03:05:30,350
only patching the phone the has no

3269
03:05:30,350 --> 03:05:35,119
internal concepts the limitations on a

3270
03:05:35,119 --> 03:05:38,629
warm up time and the sensor itself does

3271
03:05:38,629 --> 03:05:40,579
not enforce this it freely provides

3272
03:05:40,579 --> 03:05:44,270
readings even during the time when the

3273
03:05:44,270 --> 03:05:47,330
application won't show you the results

3274
03:05:47,330 --> 03:05:51,800
yep so there it goes I'm just showing

3275
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:53,720
you at the beginning that's well this

3276
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:58,790
sensor is has expired just to show the

3277
03:05:58,790 --> 03:06:03,109
full thing and then second step I'm

3278
03:06:03,109 --> 03:06:08,479
going to reset it so I take the same

3279
03:06:08,479 --> 03:06:11,660
sensor reset it it's not readable but

3280
03:06:11,660 --> 03:06:15,560
now it is you can see it full screen it

3281
03:06:15,560 --> 03:06:19,960
tells you I have erased it successfully

3282
03:06:20,170 --> 03:06:24,649
and then the next step is to well to

3283
03:06:24,649 --> 03:06:27,920
patch to do the the hook and so I am

3284
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:30,200
going to specify you might have seen a

3285
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:33,979
warm up time of two minutes

3286
03:06:33,979 --> 03:06:37,340
I am also modifying actually the wear

3287
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:40,640
time limits to four thousand and eight

3288
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:44,300
hundred days and also the we'll see that

3289
03:06:44,300 --> 03:06:46,189
a little bit later we can modify

3290
03:06:46,189 --> 03:06:49,069
actually the glucose value that's the

3291
03:06:49,069 --> 03:06:53,710
the application is going to see so here

3292
03:06:53,710 --> 03:06:59,210
well we are running the hook using

3293
03:06:59,210 --> 03:07:03,319
freedom here we've got the communication

3294
03:07:03,319 --> 03:07:08,120
and then it tells us okay notice warmup

3295
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:12,069
time two minutes only

3296
03:07:26,610 --> 03:07:30,120
so here are modified the hook so that

3297
03:07:30,120 --> 03:07:33,250
the glucose level is going to be set to

3298
03:07:33,250 --> 03:07:36,280
a very high value 500 of instance and

3299
03:07:36,280 --> 03:07:39,910
we're going to scan again and see what

3300
03:07:39,910 --> 03:07:51,521
happens yep

3301
03:07:51,521 --> 03:07:55,870
so the phone sees 500 for the current

3302
03:07:55,870 --> 03:07:57,700
third glucose level and we can do again

3303
03:07:57,700 --> 03:08:00,250
the same thing and put this time a very

3304
03:08:00,250 --> 03:08:04,720
low value well it will work exactly the

3305
03:08:04,720 --> 03:08:07,240
same thing the same way we just

3306
03:08:07,240 --> 03:08:11,220
recompile again or a hook and rescan and

3307
03:08:11,220 --> 03:08:14,710
this time the application will see a

3308
03:08:14,710 --> 03:08:17,800
very low value and will complain as a

3309
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:19,420
matter of fact that's even more critical

3310
03:08:19,420 --> 03:08:22,750
on a medical point of view so this time

3311
03:08:22,750 --> 03:08:25,690
it won't be orange but it will be dark

3312
03:08:25,690 --> 03:08:33,470
red for very low value here so this is

3313
03:08:33,470 --> 03:08:36,930
[Music]

3314
03:08:36,930 --> 03:08:44,560
about the setup okay so this is the

3315
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:47,580
video all fine

3316
03:08:55,470 --> 03:08:59,110
okay I'm always on the wrong video as it

3317
03:08:59,110 --> 03:09:04,060
seems let me have a look now I should be

3318
03:09:04,060 --> 03:09:07,960
on the right video over here okay do you

3319
03:09:07,960 --> 03:09:10,240
see my screen correctly when I share it

3320
03:09:10,240 --> 03:09:15,271
I'm gonna share it again no we don't

3321
03:09:15,271 --> 03:09:21,040
okay good thank you so those were the

3322
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:22,540
backup slides just in case something

3323
03:09:22,540 --> 03:09:26,010
went wrong but you see 500 for instance

3324
03:09:26,010 --> 03:09:29,260
glucose value the hacked warmup time

3325
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:32,110
here and here you might have noticed

3326
03:09:32,110 --> 03:09:34,960
that the wear limits has been hacked

3327
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:40,420
very long where time limits so we had

3328
03:09:40,420 --> 03:09:43,449
that one as well and now the last thing

3329
03:09:43,449 --> 03:09:46,060
that we need to hack and talk about is

3330
03:09:46,060 --> 03:09:52,510
the geographical location Travis so in

3331
03:09:52,510 --> 03:09:55,750
many different regions and then the

3332
03:09:55,750 --> 03:09:58,479
regions sometimes change over time for

3333
03:09:58,479 --> 03:10:02,410
example the region one is the European

3334
03:10:02,410 --> 03:10:04,199
Union including the United Kingdom

3335
03:10:04,199 --> 03:10:08,260
region two is for American ten-day

3336
03:10:08,260 --> 03:10:11,949
sexers region eight is for Israel and

3337
03:10:11,949 --> 03:10:14,729
there are presumably others in this list

3338
03:10:14,729 --> 03:10:18,640
the reason why there lots to each region

3339
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:23,859
is twofold first medical supplies are

3340
03:10:23,859 --> 03:10:25,960
sometimes sold on a secondhand market

3341
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:27,779
between regions with different prices

3342
03:10:27,779 --> 03:10:30,729
for example purchasing these sensors

3343
03:10:30,729 --> 03:10:33,160
without a prescription in Israel costs

3344
03:10:33,160 --> 03:10:35,470
about as much as purchasing them with

3345
03:10:35,470 --> 03:10:36,819
the prescription in the United States

3346
03:10:36,819 --> 03:10:42,729
and if they are sold secondhand this

3347
03:10:42,729 --> 03:10:43,960
sort of keeps them within a single

3348
03:10:43,960 --> 03:10:47,109
market because the official readers for

3349
03:10:47,109 --> 03:10:49,479
one market will refuse to operate with

3350
03:10:49,479 --> 03:10:53,560
sensors from another this also whether

3351
03:10:53,560 --> 03:10:56,050
by design or by accident works as a way

3352
03:10:56,050 --> 03:10:59,160
to enforce purchasing new equipment as

3353
03:10:59,160 --> 03:11:03,779
the devices are are modified so the

3354
03:11:03,779 --> 03:11:06,220
region to for the American ten-day

3355
03:11:06,220 --> 03:11:09,340
sensors these are no longer available

3356
03:11:09,340 --> 03:11:12,069
and if you go into an American pharmacy

3357
03:11:12,069 --> 03:11:13,540
and you have a prescription for these

3358
03:11:13,540 --> 03:11:15,430
things you will only get the new

3359
03:11:15,430 --> 03:11:17,529
fourteen-day sensors which do not work

3360
03:11:17,529 --> 03:11:20,199
with the 10-day breeder if you want to

3361
03:11:20,199 --> 03:11:22,449
continue using your old equipment you

3362
03:11:22,449 --> 03:11:25,420
need to import foreign sensors and then

3363
03:11:25,420 --> 03:11:29,680
change the region button which we can do

3364
03:11:29,680 --> 03:11:32,260
and then modify the CRC in order to make

3365
03:11:32,260 --> 03:11:33,670
the reader believe that it is always

3366
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:37,140
been a portion a part of the new region

3367
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:39,699
if you do this before activation and

3368
03:11:39,699 --> 03:11:41,229
continue along then everything works

3369
03:11:41,229 --> 03:11:43,289
fine

3370
03:11:47,840 --> 03:11:54,150
yep have you okay so the last thing we

3371
03:11:54,150 --> 03:11:55,979
wanted to say about this is that well

3372
03:11:55,979 --> 03:12:01,110
it's extremely cool and nice to well to

3373
03:12:01,110 --> 03:12:02,760
to hack a sensor it was really

3374
03:12:02,760 --> 03:12:05,640
interesting watch but to be honest

3375
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:08,790
although those hacks are not extremely

3376
03:12:08,790 --> 03:12:11,520
difficult they really still are a little

3377
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:14,520
bit difficult let's say it is really far

3378
03:12:14,520 --> 03:12:20,240
easier to to hack a smartphone and just

3379
03:12:20,240 --> 03:12:24,380
for instance code five minutes

3380
03:12:24,380 --> 03:12:26,700
application mobile application that will

3381
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:28,740
do a denial of service on the smartphone

3382
03:12:28,740 --> 03:12:33,210
and so in that case as the the sensor

3383
03:12:33,210 --> 03:12:36,990
isn't that bad that badly designed and

3384
03:12:36,990 --> 03:12:37,830
implemented

3385
03:12:37,830 --> 03:12:40,260
the weakest link is not the sensor but

3386
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:42,750
the smartphone okay so that's just

3387
03:12:42,750 --> 03:12:45,300
something we we wanted to point out here

3388
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:48,810
is that well you've got to secure your

3389
03:12:48,810 --> 03:12:50,370
smart phones because if you're using

3390
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:53,940
them for medical use well then it's

3391
03:12:53,940 --> 03:12:56,160
going to be so simple just unfortunately

3392
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:58,650
to get your your phone infected with

3393
03:12:58,650 --> 03:13:01,830
ransomware or with a fake diabeetus

3394
03:13:01,830 --> 03:13:04,740
application and there are really quite

3395
03:13:04,740 --> 03:13:07,020
lots of them it's not just a one or two

3396
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:10,620
so really take care of your of your

3397
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:16,780
phone if that is the case Travis

03:13:27,979 --> 03:13:36,090
sorry on the link and I believe it will

3400
03:13:36,090 --> 03:13:37,979
probably be up somewhere else oh maybe

3401
03:13:37,979 --> 03:13:41,550
on on the website for something else of

3402
03:13:41,550 --> 03:13:49,680
pest assault the in order to perform

3403
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:51,390
patching the only thing that is missing

3404
03:13:51,390 --> 03:13:54,720
is the vendors for by backdoor password

3405
03:13:54,720 --> 03:13:57,190
you can find us elsewhere or snow

3406
03:13:57,190 --> 03:14:00,510
from the vendor's application yourself

3407
03:14:00,510 --> 03:14:06,160
we have a Python script which dumps the

3408
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:09,490
FM out of a sensor using an NFC reader

3409
03:14:09,490 --> 03:14:13,260
and then decodes it in order to show you

3410
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:17,290
we have a popper gtfo article in issue

3411
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:22,360
20 on how to work with this chip just

3412
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:24,910
the RF 43050 laid out one five two and

3413
03:14:24,910 --> 03:14:27,280
also the publicly available trip that

3414
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:31,000
matches it of the RF 430 fil one five

3415
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,970
two and then we have a presentation from

3416
03:14:33,970 --> 03:14:37,330
blackouts on how we don't reverse

3417
03:14:37,330 --> 03:14:39,940
engineer confirm where all of these are

3418
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:45,760
publicly available yep and thank you

3419
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:48,630
very much for listening

3420
03:14:49,200 --> 03:14:53,550
we've question from the chat

3421
03:14:53,760 --> 03:14:57,730
did we try a CRC revenge and did this

3422
03:14:57,730 --> 03:15:04,990
work so the answer is probably no

3423
03:15:04,990 --> 03:15:09,311
because I do not know CRC revenge dotnet

3424
03:15:09,311 --> 03:15:28,870
let me have a look immediately so no I

3425
03:15:28,870 --> 03:15:33,030
didn't try that but I did try online

3426
03:15:33,030 --> 03:15:36,460
computations of CRC so I would I would

3427
03:15:36,460 --> 03:15:39,490
just feed in the the memory blocks and

3428
03:15:39,490 --> 03:15:42,101
see the difference output for all the

3429
03:15:42,101 --> 03:15:44,141
types of cereal or nearly all the types

3430
03:15:44,141 --> 03:15:46,960
of CRC's that that exists and that's how

3431
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:49,570
we found out that it wasn't matching

3432
03:15:49,570 --> 03:15:53,230
anything in there and then I did a

3433
03:15:53,230 --> 03:15:58,290
script my own scripts to modify the the

3434
03:15:58,290 --> 03:16:01,750
memory values and put some zeros instead

3435
03:16:01,750 --> 03:16:03,670
in the blocks or some FF in the blocks

3436
03:16:03,670 --> 03:16:07,180
for things like that we have another

3437
03:16:07,180 --> 03:16:09,530
question in the chat

3438
03:16:09,530 --> 03:16:13,340
I have a question regarding the wearing

3439
03:16:13,340 --> 03:16:15,290
time as you said the modified duration

3440
03:16:15,290 --> 03:16:18,260
value on the Android app if you modified

3441
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:19,550
the duration value in the Android app

3442
03:16:19,550 --> 03:16:21,560
with freedom but does it affect the

3443
03:16:21,560 --> 03:16:24,320
sensor 2 or should we wait 14 days and

3444
03:16:24,320 --> 03:16:29,570
resurrected again I'm reading it again

3445
03:16:29,570 --> 03:16:40,190
as you modify the duration so the answer

3446
03:16:40,190 --> 03:16:42,950
to the to that one is that it's um so

3447
03:16:42,950 --> 03:16:47,120
the duration value so the four thousand

3448
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:49,190
and eight hundreds days that we said

3449
03:16:49,190 --> 03:16:54,050
that we hooked in with freedom they do

3450
03:16:54,050 --> 03:16:57,470
affect the sensor life because as far as

3451
03:16:57,470 --> 03:16:59,810
I know there is no such limitation on

3452
03:16:59,810 --> 03:17:02,630
the sensor itself so which means that we

3453
03:17:02,630 --> 03:17:04,640
could have been using that sensor for

3454
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:06,800
those four thousand and an eight hundred

3455
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:09,620
days provided that the battery didn't

3456
03:17:09,620 --> 03:17:12,260
learn I didn't wear off before that time

3457
03:17:12,260 --> 03:17:16,490
of course so yes it's absolutely affects

3458
03:17:16,490 --> 03:17:21,020
the well the sensor is usable for that's

3459
03:17:21,020 --> 03:17:23,330
four hundred and four thousand seven

3460
03:17:23,330 --> 03:17:25,990
days sorry

3461
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:32,540
and it's only accurate concept of the

3462
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:39,830
outside time comes from the we have

3463
03:17:39,830 --> 03:17:42,170
another question is it possible to use

3464
03:17:42,170 --> 03:17:45,740
JTAG interface on Tahl no that's for you

3465
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:53,000
this one is infuriating so the the way

3466
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:56,240
that the public works that are the

3467
03:17:56,240 --> 03:18:00,590
documented ship the FRL is that there is

3468
03:18:00,590 --> 03:18:03,650
a tire and JTAG is not quite compatible

3469
03:18:03,650 --> 03:18:06,110
with the public tools but you can patch

3470
03:18:06,110 --> 03:18:09,080
those tools to add compatibility and the

3471
03:18:09,080 --> 03:18:13,850
difference is that there's an unlock

3472
03:18:13,850 --> 03:18:16,910
value or a key not really a password but

3473
03:18:16,910 --> 03:18:19,400
something like it that is written in by

3474
03:18:19,400 --> 03:18:20,580
JTAG and we're

3475
03:18:20,580 --> 03:18:27,480
to expose the interface this value can

3476
03:18:27,480 --> 03:18:30,450
be found for the public ship for the

3477
03:18:30,450 --> 03:18:32,400
private ship we tried that same value

3478
03:18:32,400 --> 03:18:34,350
we tried guessing then we tried fuzzing

3479
03:18:34,350 --> 03:18:38,040
them we were able to set everything up

3480
03:18:38,040 --> 03:18:39,870
to where the JTAG should be unlocked we

3481
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:41,850
have the wiring confirmed correctly and

3482
03:18:41,850 --> 03:18:45,750
we never managed to get a connection we

3483
03:18:45,750 --> 03:18:47,250
don't quite know whether it's because we

3484
03:18:47,250 --> 03:18:49,110
don't have the correct 30 T but I'm not

3485
03:18:49,110 --> 03:18:52,290
valley where if there's some other type

3486
03:18:52,290 --> 03:18:56,700
of block in the custom report area chips

3487
03:18:56,700 --> 03:19:02,970
let's yell some more questions from the

3488
03:19:02,970 --> 03:19:06,061
chat what is the maximum time the sensor

3489
03:19:06,061 --> 03:19:09,960
can be used without risk the sensor is

3490
03:19:09,960 --> 03:19:15,420
very expensive so I can perhaps a little

3491
03:19:15,420 --> 03:19:19,590
bit answer there I know that the the

3492
03:19:19,590 --> 03:19:23,040
vendor has certified certified it for 14

3493
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:25,890
days I saw some medical articles there

3494
03:19:25,890 --> 03:19:29,190
where it had been certified in the US

3495
03:19:29,190 --> 03:19:32,820
for 14 days meaning that they they had

3496
03:19:32,820 --> 03:19:36,300
measured that the sensor gave accurate

3497
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:40,320
results until those 14 days and then

3498
03:19:40,320 --> 03:19:42,570
that it was decreasing but I do not have

3499
03:19:42,570 --> 03:19:45,960
the details of how fast it is decreasing

3500
03:19:45,960 --> 03:19:48,960
and I do not have either the details on

3501
03:19:48,960 --> 03:19:51,540
the medical part is it going to what in

3502
03:19:51,540 --> 03:19:53,850
order to affect your skin to be too long

3503
03:19:53,850 --> 03:19:57,061
on your skin above those 14 days or

3504
03:19:57,061 --> 03:19:59,070
things like that from a technical point

3505
03:19:59,070 --> 03:20:02,040
of view there is absolutely no issue to

3506
03:20:02,040 --> 03:20:04,980
be using them more than those 14 days

3507
03:20:04,980 --> 03:20:10,160
okay the issue is only medical here

3508
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:12,690
Travis if you have anything else to add

3509
03:20:12,690 --> 03:20:20,670
to that question record further but you

3510
03:20:20,670 --> 03:20:23,820
know nothing about how the accuracy

3511
03:20:23,820 --> 03:20:27,271
dress presumably the cue weak

3512
03:20:27,271 --> 03:20:29,040
measurement is rather conservative in

3513
03:20:29,040 --> 03:20:30,420
order to ensure that the results are

3514
03:20:30,420 --> 03:20:32,891
always valid at some

3515
03:20:32,891 --> 03:20:35,070
the results will begin to drift too far

3516
03:20:35,070 --> 03:20:41,530
in saying we have another question I

3517
03:20:41,530 --> 03:20:42,910
believe for you perhaps

3518
03:20:42,910 --> 03:20:45,580
Travis another from the chat is is there

3519
03:20:45,580 --> 03:20:48,370
a way to research that tell 152 to its

3520
03:20:48,370 --> 03:20:50,561
factory settings getting rid of all

3521
03:20:50,561 --> 03:20:53,710
Abbott code so I believe this would be

3522
03:20:53,710 --> 03:20:57,641
like moving it to tell to nearly FRL 140

3523
03:20:57,641 --> 03:21:05,110
150 to perhaps soldering an FRL chip in

3524
03:21:05,110 --> 03:21:07,480
its place but you cannot do this through

3525
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:09,551
software even if you had a trade tech

3526
03:21:09,551 --> 03:21:13,360
connection because the Tal chip contains

3527
03:21:13,360 --> 03:21:16,051
a different mass ROM from the FRL chip

3528
03:21:16,051 --> 03:21:18,670
and you can see by reading the code that

3529
03:21:18,670 --> 03:21:20,880
they forked off rather early they have

3530
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:23,261
many of the same functions but with

3531
03:21:23,261 --> 03:21:24,670
different parameters and calling

3532
03:21:24,670 --> 03:21:29,670
conventions though it's not possible to

3533
03:21:29,670 --> 03:21:32,880
replace the mass ROM of the chip and

3534
03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:35,860
remove the Abbott code from there but it

3535
03:21:35,860 --> 03:21:40,000
is possible to change the F Ram code so

3536
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:43,150
if you wanted to put a small game into

3537
03:21:43,150 --> 03:21:45,101
it or if you wanted to hide a message in

3538
03:21:45,101 --> 03:21:49,150
there or run new sensor code of your own

3539
03:21:49,150 --> 03:21:51,851
should we use the distinction you can

3540
03:21:51,851 --> 03:21:55,450
freely do that there will just be some

3541
03:21:55,450 --> 03:22:20,170
of the original code remaining the

3542
03:22:20,170 --> 03:22:26,771
conference centers yes thank you very

3543
03:22:26,771 --> 03:22:31,480
much it is it is it was the last the

3544
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:33,820
last talk of this third edition of this

3545
03:22:33,820 --> 03:22:37,740
first edition in a virtual mode for us

3546
03:22:37,740 --> 03:22:42,280
it was quite neat it runs quite smoothly

3547
03:22:42,280 --> 03:22:46,250
so I hope you are

3548
03:22:46,250 --> 03:22:51,890
you are quite okay with with the way it

3549
03:22:51,890 --> 03:22:56,990
run as a register attendees you are

3550
03:22:56,990 --> 03:23:02,180
going to receive a form to get your

3551
03:23:02,180 --> 03:23:06,710
feedback please fill it and send it to

3552
03:23:06,710 --> 03:23:15,200
us it helps us a lot to to tune the

3553
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:18,470
things that are quite a success and the

3554
03:23:18,470 --> 03:23:23,120
things that have to be improved so I am

3555
03:23:23,120 --> 03:23:31,040
going to share some shot number of of

3556
03:23:31,040 --> 03:23:38,810
slides just to to give a last exposure

3557
03:23:38,810 --> 03:23:43,580
to all of our sponsors thanks to them to

3558
03:23:43,580 --> 03:23:47,900
