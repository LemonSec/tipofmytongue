1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,639
recording so francisco go for it

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
all right excellent oh can everybody see

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
the screen

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
yeah looking good yep got it all right

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,240
perfect

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,799
so um

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,760
in order to kind of get the presentation

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,960
flowing and everything

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
um i'm not really paying attention to

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,000
the chat

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,280
window on the uh webex meetings so you

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,160
can use the

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,079
dysport channel uh under events

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,040
i posted up the uh slides in a pdf

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,079
format uh

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,559
there as well and uh if you can just ask

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,000
your questions over there that'd be

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
uh perfect right so um

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
my presentation is called join the dark

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
side uh to keep the lights on so

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
um i got interested in

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,359
the what what what happens after

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,120
hurricane right so

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,479
after hurricane you're gonna lose power

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,159
how long are you gonna lose power for

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,040
depends on

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
uh your aerial uh your your house i mean

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,360
a lot of factors right but essentially

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
you can safely more or less um

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
know that you're you can be without

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,880
power for a week

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
or a month um i remember

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
in the last hurricanes uh specifically

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,680
katrina

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
uh we were i was out of power for about

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,040
two weeks

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
so um a really hard time a lot of you

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,920
see a lot of people uh run over to uh

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
starbucks to get power

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
and uh your your own little ups power

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,759
system

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
would only last you know an hour-ish

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
and uh and and then you don't have a way

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,479
to deal with that

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,000
right so even if you have a um

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,119
a generator right uh even with a

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,079
generator

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,560
um you have to constantly keep uh um

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,119
gassing that up and when there's a

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,759
hurricane

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,799
you have a huge crunch in uh

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,560
in that supply uh line as well so

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
i started thinking about hey how can we

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
how how can i get a power wall right um

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,480
so

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,040
what's a power wall right a power wall

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,680
is

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
going to be a home battery system

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
right so over here those are the actual

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
power wall modules

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
right and uh you can charge them either

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
with uh the

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
electric system or with uh solar power

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
right uh when i made these uh

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,959
presentation about

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
six months ago there were about eight

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
eleven thousand dollars

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,440
uh to install with uh

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
with the batteries themselves right so

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
that essentially comes out to 846

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
dollars per kilowatt

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,120
hour right um and and this

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,159
this being a 13 kilowatt system

74
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,440
so um

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
i didn't really have you know 13 000 but

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,680
it's probably

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
gonna be more because um what the

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
installation doesn't really

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,319
include is a uh power switch

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
that you have to put in in between the

81
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,599
uh grid

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
and the battery so that the battery

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
power doesn't uh feedback

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
into uh the grid system when they're

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,280
trying to uh connect it but um

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,799
the goal for me wasn't necessarily to

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
have my entire house running right uh i

88
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,599
didn't want

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,319
like i wish i could have ac but um with

90
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,680
this power system yeah you can probably

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
have ac

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,040
uh but like two days uh the the point

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
would really was to keep the lights on

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
because during a hurricane uh if you can

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,319
keep the lights on

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
uh maybe uh turn on tv maybe keep uh

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,560
keep the

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
uh fridge on you're really ahead of the

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
game at that point um uh

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,720
in my personal opinion right so

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
um before i really start going into

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
all of the batteries um this is

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,238
definitely a uh

104
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,639
do at your own risk uh type of thing i'm

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
not an expert in any way shape or form

106
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:20,798
on

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,919
uh of batteries or power uh

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,320
or uh

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
like the nitty gritties of uh

110
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,840
electricity um

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,960
like the previous talk we had um so

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
definitely um read the diy battery book

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
first

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
uh this is huge in avoiding and managing

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
this type of risk

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
right so what type of risk are we

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
talking about so um

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
a couple of years ago the uh samsung

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,720
notes

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
uh came out and uh you saw that they

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
were causing fires because uh

122
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
people were left their phone in inside

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
of the car for a bit

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
and then all of a sudden those um uh

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
battery packs

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
uh just went up in flanks and

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,039
um the the the chemistry that we're

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,000
talking we're

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
going to be mainly dealing with is going

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
to be lithium ion uh we're going to be

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,039
talking about lithium ion because

132
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,440
they are they're more or less the

133
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,039
standard

134
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
for high power and low weight batteries

135
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,800
which is really um uh

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,440
kind of like the best combination all

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,919
right

138
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
so um let me know if the video doesn't

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,320
come out

140
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,000
that's great but amps how okay powerful

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
can these batteries be so this is uh

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
six batteries in parallel

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
and

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
you can see that that's a wrench that's

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,720
being uh

146
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
heating up uh almost almost being used

147
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,600
as a heating element so

148
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
you can get a lot of power from these

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
batteries right that's definitely

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
something i really wanted to get across

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,319
um

152
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,120
you can you can run a lot of power and

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,400
you can cause a lot of damage at the

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,680
same time so

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,880
uh definitely be aware of that all right

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
so what can you use this power for you

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
can use it for emergency power you can

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,199
use it uh

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,680
for uh camping all right uh collecting

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,639
solar power

161
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
but you can use it for tailgating or uh

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,840
mobile power so

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,800
if you want to go out um to a game you

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
can create

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,479
uh build a battery enough uh to power uh

166
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,199
boombox

167
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,600
or an extra tv or really whatever the

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
case may be

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
because since we're going to be using

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
lithium-ion batteries

171
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
it's it's not like you're hauling a car

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
batteries

173
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,160
uh uh a car battery worth of of

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
of power your if if you were to carry

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,639
the same amount of weight

176
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,120
um from a lead acid battery as

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
as a lithium-ion battery you would have

178
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
you you just have

179
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
so much more power condensed into the

180
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
lithium ion

181
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
that you can do a lot more with it all

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,880
right

183
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
so uh how to make a bat uh we're going

184
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,080
to be talking about the

185
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,479
just basic uh batter battery knowledge

186
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
enough to

187
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,160
kind of uh be able to get you started

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
with it

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
uh we're going to be talking about

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
sourcing the eight one

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
six five zero cells um which are uh the

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
batteries that

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,919
uh we're mainly going to be talking

194
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,759
about uh soldering the

195
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,880
uh power blocks uh to the pcb ports

196
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
and how to actually use the power that

197
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
we get from the battery that we're

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,360
going to build all right so

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
basic battery knowledge uh we're going

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
to be talking about volts amps and what

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,880
so

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
uh voltage which is this guy right here

203
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
uh the uh current in amps which is the

204
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
pa uh the the power output that you get

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,599
here

206
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
uh the resistance which is going to be

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
the ohms and then finally the

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
uh powering watts so um

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
a really really good chart uh to get if

210
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
you

211
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
decide hey uh uh you know this is good

212
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,440
talk um

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
i've been looking for something like

214
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
this is uh this little chart right here

215
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,560
um if you just google ohm's law um

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
this is one of those power converters

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,919
that uh uh really pops up a lot

218
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
and uh why is this important well um if

219
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,520
you take a look

220
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,800
at your uh regular phone charger or any

221
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
uh power block power supply it's going

222
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
to say output

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,800
right and um the power output is usually

224
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
going to say

225
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,159
hey this is going to be this out this

226
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
power charger outputs five volts

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
at uh three amps right so when you

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
multiply five volts by 3 amps you get

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,760
the uh power output

230
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,720
of that charger so um what that means is

231
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,440
you're

232
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
you're pushing 15 watts of power into

233
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
uh that battery that that you're

234
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
charging

235
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
so when

236
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
over the years as you start collecting

237
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,519
uh more

238
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
uh electronic stuff you start collecting

239
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,720
a lot more batteries

240
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
and a lot more power inverters um

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,560
and essentially you end up with a box uh

242
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
full of junk

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
uh that you can no longer use um

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,000
after learning how power works and

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,880
even at this basic knowledge um i'm able

246
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
to actually reclaim some of

247
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
some of those systems you know repurpose

248
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
them uh later on so

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,279
this is such a good example of being

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,640
able to

251
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,800
grab uh knowledge in order to

252
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,680
repurpose things that you otherwise

253
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
wouldn't uh wouldn't be able to use

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,920
okay um so i i really like this picture

255
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,640
because it

256
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,959
it definitely really helps you kind of

257
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,200
understand a little bit more of

258
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
how are these uh identical

259
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
how each individual thing uh comes into

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,560
play right so

261
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
um if you ever get confused go back to

262
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,600
the slide and

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,079
uh it helps visualize things a little

264
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,880
bit better which

265
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,920
i definitely always uh find useful

266
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,399
right uh so we're talking about um here

267
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,680
we're gonna be talking about batteries

268
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
in series

269
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
so batteries in series is usually uh

270
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
something that if you ever connected

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
a uh battery into like the

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
aaa batteries into something and you had

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
to put them uh

274
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
one up the other one upside down one of

275
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,079
the other one upside down

276
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
that's usually because you were

277
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
connecting the batteries in series

278
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
so uh in this example all right

279
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,399
um inner series batteries of like

280
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,360
voltage

281
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
and amp power capacity are connected to

282
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,560
increase the voltage

283
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
so whenever you hear of batteries in

284
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,320
series you always have to think

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,399
at the volts right so over here we have

286
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,519
four batteries

287
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
uh there are 12 volts each when you

288
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,800
connect them inside of a circuit

289
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,839
all right and uh what's again in series

290
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,800
means

291
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
uh that you're connecting the negative

292
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,160
to the positive the negative

293
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,920
to the positive the negative to the

294
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
positive all the way until you complete

295
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
that circuit it's really important

296
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
all right so we're adding 12 volts plus

297
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
12 volts 24

298
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,760
plus 12 volts 36 until we get the the

299
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,320
final 12 volts which is going to be 48

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
right uh the next way that you can

301
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
connect uh batteries together

302
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,399
is batteries in parallel all right uh

303
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,760
that means that you're going to

304
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,040
be connecting the positive to the

305
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
positive and the negative

306
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
to the negative all right so uh

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
connecting batteries in parallel

308
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
increases the total current capacity by

309
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,079
decreasing total

310
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,320
resistance and it also increases overall

311
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
amp hour capacity

312
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,160
all batteries in a paradigm uh bank must

313
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200
have the same

314
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,160
voltage rating right so that means that

315
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
if uh

316
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
you're connecting two of these batteries

317
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
in parallel all right they have to be

318
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,000
three volts and uh this battery also has

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,279
to be three volts

320
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,399
all right um everything has to be pretty

321
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:58,880
much

322
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,399
a a copy of uh

323
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
all the batteries have to have the same

324
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,079
uh capacity they have to have the same

325
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,720
rating

326
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
that's really important uh for this to

327
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,079
work

328
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,200
because what happens is uh for example

329
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
if we had this battery at three volts

330
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
and we had this battery at three volts

331
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
but we had

332
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,920
this battery at four volts

333
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
when you up connect this to to a

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
to actually extract the battery right uh

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,760
um

336
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
for example let's say you're charging a

337
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
phone uh the battery with

338
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
the most capacity is going to be the one

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,760
that's going to be

340
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
supplying most of the power so

341
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
let's say you know you've charged your

342
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
phone for about 15 minutes

343
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
this battery is going to be completely

344
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
uh depleted in comparison to

345
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
these batteries which would have barely

346
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
been used

347
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,519
so in order for everything to uh

348
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
be charged in a discharge at the same

349
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,560
rate

350
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
they all have to have the same capacity

351
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
in the same specs right

352
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,959
so uh these are a few examples of

353
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,839
um what to do and what not to do right

354
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,320
so

355
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,880
over here we have an example of uh

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,639
batteries uh connected in parallel so

357
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,320
this is a six volt battery with four

358
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,880
point

359
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,240
five amp hours 6 volt battery 5 uh

360
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
4.5 amp hours and remember it's parallel

361
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,480
so we're going to be connecting the

362
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
positive to the positive

363
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,040
and the negative to the negative right

364
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,440
so

365
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,519
since we connected it in parallel that

366
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,480
means that the

367
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
amps are going to go up so we take 4.5

368
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
amps and 4.5 amps

369
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,040
and we're going to get a total of 9 amps

370
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
and because we're connecting them in

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
parallel the volts don't go up so this

372
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
is still the six volt batteries it's

373
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,680
still

374
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,399
six volts and we we only have six volts

375
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,040
here

376
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,360
so um an example of how not to do it

377
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,720
is uh right over here so we have a six

378
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
volt battery

379
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,959
with 4.5 hours and we have a 6 volt

380
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,839
battery with

381
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
10 amp hours so because of this mismatch

382
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,359
in amp hour rating all right

383
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
this type of setup is going to work but

384
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
you're going to overuse the 10 ounce

385
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,639
hour battery

386
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,800
before uh you use the 4.5 amp hour

387
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
uh our battery and it's it's just not

388
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,079
going to turn

389
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
out well um this

390
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,320
is partly how you get

391
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
the uh overcharge in uh uh lithium ion

392
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
cells

393
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,880
because since they're taking all uh

394
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,959
like the the the majority of the power

395
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,560
is only coming out of one cell

396
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
they're gonna get hotter quickly uh

397
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,040
quicker and the harder they get the more

398
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,959
uh they if you almost think about it

399
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,519
like a a nuclear reaction

400
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,120
where if if it gets too hot past

401
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
its uh safety rating point it's just

402
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,240
gonna go

403
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
into uh that that nuclear reaction and

404
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,839
that's how you get

405
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,199
um uh those cells to explode and uh uh

406
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,160
burst

407
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
into flames and once you get one of

408
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,079
those batteries bursting into flame

409
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,880
good luck uh putting them out um and and

410
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
that's

411
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,920
that that's really how uh what what

412
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,360
you're trying to avoid

413
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
um and and that's what a lot of people

414
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,000
don't necessarily pay attention

415
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
to sometimes they just see oh this is

416
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,920
six volts this is six volts

417
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
um i'll be able to connect the uh both

418
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,079
of these batteries together

419
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
and that's incorrect all right uh over

420
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
here we have an example of uh

421
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,199
batteries connected in series so um this

422
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,519
is in series so we're going to increase

423
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
the voltage of the battery so this is 6

424
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
volts 6 volts

425
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,160
4.5 amps 4.5 amps um

426
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
we're going to be connecting the

427
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
negative to the positive and we're going

428
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,639
to

429
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,880
be over here at the power source

430
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,440
is where everything gets connected so

431
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
we're increasing the 6 volts

432
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
to 12 volts and then the amperage of the

433
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,759
batteries stay the same all right

434
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,920
um over here we have the same example

435
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,839
where the batteries are connected

436
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,279
in series and they're connecting the

437
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,920
series uh

438
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
yeah properly where we have the negative

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,079
connected uh to the positive

440
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,759
um but uh because the uh the batteries

441
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,880
are not uh in the same spec this is 4.5

442
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,160
hours this is 10

443
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,600
amp hours uh you're it's gonna work but

444
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,519
this is where you're uh going to do it

445
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,120
wrong uh the battery with the most

446
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,920
capacity

447
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
is the one going to be handling most of

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,519
the load

449
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
all right now there's a way that

450
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,959
um we can get both higher

451
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,040
uh voltage and higher amperage

452
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680
uh inside of these batteries so that

453
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
means that we're going to be connecting

454
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
a total of four batteries and we're

455
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,079
going to be uh connecting them together

456
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,439
right um 12 volt is a

457
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
very common voltage uh for example your

458
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,039
car runs on

459
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,079
on 12 volts all the accessory power

460
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,640
that uh that you're pulling out of your

461
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,520
car in

462
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
inside your car is gonna be running at

463
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,799
12 volts right

464
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,799
if you needed uh more power than that

465
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,160
well you

466
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,280
really wouldn't be able to get more

467
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
power than uh 12 volts because your car

468
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,079
battery itself is

469
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,559
a 12 volt battery unless you're running

470
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,600
trucks um

471
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,799
so um what you want to be aware of

472
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,440
is since we have uh four six volt

473
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,799
batteries we want to be able to connect

474
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,840
them all together

475
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,640
to to get that uh 12 volt circuit right

476
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
so we're

477
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
first we're going to be connecting

478
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
batteries in in series because remember

479
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,679
in series

480
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
we we get uh increase the voltage so

481
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,200
we're going to get six volts plus six

482
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,840
volts

483
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,520
to get the those uh 12.

484
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
all right uh so over here uh these

485
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,200
batteries are actually connected uh

486
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
first in parallel so

487
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,679
we have the uh positive to the positive

488
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,480
the negative

489
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
uh to the negative all right which is

490
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,559
going to give us the 9 amp hours

491
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
all right and uh over here in this

492
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
section these are also connected in

493
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,000
parallel so

494
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,600
uh positive to positive and negative to

495
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,240
negative

496
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,840
okay uh now this uh negative power volt

497
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,520
is um actually connected to the load

498
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
as is this one uh on the second

499
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,799
uh uh battery that we're grouping so we

500
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,760
really think about both of these uh uh

501
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,480
two batteries

502
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,320
as group one and group two all right um

503
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,840
group one and group two are connected in

504
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,360
parallel uh giving you

505
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,799
the uh nine uh amp hours and then when

506
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,360
you connect

507
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,559
both of these bad uh group one uh here's

508
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,200
the uh

509
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,640
positive all right uh to group two

510
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,720
uh to the negative all right and then we

511
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
have uh the

512
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
negative being connected uh to the

513
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,799
positive over here

514
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,679
uh that's what increases the total uh

515
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,320
output

516
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,080
of this battery uh to 12 volts and nine

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,360
amp hours all right um

518
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
it's not going to be six plus six plus

519
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
six plus six

520
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
uh because it's only two batteries that

521
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
are actually connected

522
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,320
in uh in series and uh

523
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,720
those two groups those two batteries are

524
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
group one and group two the second you

525
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,000
uh create the parallel connection here

526
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,679
uh again you're grouping the battery so

527
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,080
um it gets really really uh

528
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
convoluted and uh and strange if you

529
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,720
don't map out

530
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
uh the uh batteries itself but um that's

531
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,120
one of the reasons that we're gonna be

532
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
talking about these pcb ports that

533
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,360
pretty much

534
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,760
do all this type of series and parallel

535
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
connections for you so you don't really

536
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,320
have to think about it

537
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
but it's really uh really important for

538
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
you to understand

539
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,280
why that pcb works um

540
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,200
in in the way that it works how it

541
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
actually gets to that average and that

542
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,520
voltage

543
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
uh rating right so

544
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
um what what you really have to

545
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,360
understand about connecting

546
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,159
batteries together right is that they

547
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:18,799
all

548
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,000
have to be balanced right and by balance

549
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,039
i mean

550
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,600
a a six volt battery if you're

551
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,480
connecting a

552
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
a series of batteries in uh in series or

553
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,559
in parallel

554
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,320
uh you want to make sure that they're

555
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
they all have the same specs

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
all right um they all have to be either

557
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,679
six volts or they all have to be 12

558
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,520
volts they all have to have the same

559
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
power rating uh because if not that's

560
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,880
where you

561
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,559
one battery if uh if if one battery is

562
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
the the one with the highest spec then

563
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,159
that's the battery that's going to be

564
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,840
doing uh

565
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
the majority of the work and that's the

566
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
one that's uh going to be your weak link

567
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,080
in uh inside of your battery pack

568
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,679
so the batteries that

569
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,280
you have everywhere is usually

570
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
usually these batteries right um they're

571
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
almost

572
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
like three times the size of a regular

573
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
uh double a battery

574
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,520
and it's

575
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
it's what you're gonna be seeing

576
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
everywhere inside your laptop you have

577
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,000
these batteries

578
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,960
uh in inside your power tools these are

579
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,320
the batteries that are

580
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
are going to be inside of those uh

581
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,120
battery packs all right so

582
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,000
uh one once you understand that uh the

583
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
the reason that

584
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,240
my laptop battery that i bought six

585
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,039
years ago

586
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,320
the reason that those batteries no

587
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
longer work is because these batteries

588
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,720
are completely

589
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,840
gone so you can buy a new uh

590
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,960
battery from the manufacturer itself

591
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
it's gonna cost you

592
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,280
um 50 bucks 80 bucks depending on the

593
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
battery capacity or you can buy

594
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
three of these batteries which is

595
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
usually uh what's included

596
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,039
in inside of your power pack uh

597
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,400
reconnect them together and

598
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
you can do it for 15 bucks instead of uh

599
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,520
80 bucks or 50 watts

600
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,400
right so why why are they called the 1 8

601
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
uh 18650 battery

602
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,880
265 batteries are lithium batteries it's

603
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
really important that you understand the

604
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,440
uh chemistry

605
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
that you're working with this is lithium

606
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,799
ion all right uh they get their name

607
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
from their size which is 18 millimeters

608
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
right by 65 millimeters what is the zero

609
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,360
stand for i don't know

610
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
uh these batteries are not uh uh only

611
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
used in flashlights but also in power

612
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
tools electric vehicles vaporizers

613
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
cameras laptops and more

614
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,120
um on that note like

615
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
what a tesla is made out of is a whole

616
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
bunch of uh these 18650 batteries

617
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,880
uh they just made their own battery

618
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,919
which was released

619
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,480
back in december but um all those uh

620
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
teslas that have been on the road for

621
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,320
three years uh these are the batteries

622
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,720
that

623
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,440
they're gonna be taking out uh and uh

624
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
that are gonna be recycled out and

625
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
available to the general public

626
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
uh once uh once those people start

627
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
training in their cars

628
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
and uh switching the battery on tesla so

629
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
um

630
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
this is why uh this 18650 cell

631
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,960
is so uh widely available and and used

632
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
this is pretty more or less the standard

633
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
for rechargeable batteries

634
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
uh because of its uh capacity

635
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,400
it's you know ease of

636
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,200
use and the completely wild

637
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
configurations that you can do with them

638
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
all right um again so if

639
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,559
when whenever you're thinking about

640
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,039
building this type of uh battery system

641
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,320
if you don't use these uh cells um again

642
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,279
you want to make sure that

643
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,480
all these specs uh are the same

644
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
for whatever uh battery you're building

645
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
right um that includes the

646
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
chemistry uh diameter length

647
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,279
again you're using the same battery so

648
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,039
you definitely want to pay attention to

649
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,159
that but uh

650
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,520
the voltage uh nominal so this is at uh

651
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,640
full power what uh the battery

652
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
um voltage is going to be

653
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,360
the charge voltage cut off so

654
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,039
this at four point four point two volts

655
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,200
is what you're going to be charging the

656
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,159
battery at

657
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,720
so you need to understand hey um how

658
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,679
much power do

659
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
uh am i going to have when these

660
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,640
batteries are fully charged and

661
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,000
you're also going to need to understand

662
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,919
how to charge these batteries

663
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,600
right and know when they're charged

664
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,360
which for this it's going to be 4.2

665
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,720
volts

666
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,320
all right um so

667
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
a it really interesting thing uh of

668
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
why you need to understand how these uh

669
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,679
chemistries work is

670
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,080
even though these bad you know these

671
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,919
batteries are fully charged when

672
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,080
uh the charger tells you hey i'm i'm

673
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
feeding it uh 4.2 volts

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,159
and that's where it's going to cut off

675
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,600
all right the second you

676
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,799
finish charging that battery the most

677
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,760
you're going to be able to

678
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,159
pull all right the usable power out of

679
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,159
that is only 3.6 volts and then it's

680
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,200
going to dip down

681
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
all the way until usually um the safe

682
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
buffer zone is about 3 volts

683
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,360
so you only have 0.6 volts to use so

684
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
something really important now the

685
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,039
discharging cutoff

686
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,200
is 2.5 volts but you don't want it to

687
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,679
get

688
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,799
here because the second um

689
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,240
thing about this type of chemistry

690
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,559
lithium ion is that the second

691
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,840
it gets the 2.5 volts if at

692
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,559
any given point in time all right it

693
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,240
gets to 2.5 volts

694
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
uh the battery capacity just went

695
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
completely down

696
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
right so if you're um you're expecting

697
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
to get 300 to 500 uh recharge cycles out

698
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
of these batteries

699
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,200
uh but the way you get to 500 is not by

700
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,480
ever discharging it to

701
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,760
uh uh 2.5 volts you you maintain that

702
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,799
by only discharging it to 3 volts

703
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,000
2.8 volts if you um

704
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,919
want to cut it down but uh never to 2.5

705
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,520
if it goes to 2.5 or lower uh you're

706
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
you you just went from 500 cycles to

707
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,679
300. if you do it again then you're only

708
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,840
going to get 200 cycles out of it

709
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,440
um so it's again it this is the behavior

710
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,760
of

711
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
lithium ion so that's that's why it's

712
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,360
important to

713
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,400
understand why lithium ion uh behaves

714
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,919
completely different from

715
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
your standard car battery which is uh

716
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,960
going to be

717
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
a lead acid battery which lead acid

718
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
batteries you can discharge

719
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,880
um much lower uh but even with those

720
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
batteries you're gonna have uh different

721
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
behaviors

722
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,760
all right um so i'm going to be talking

723
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,240
about

724
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
reclaimed batteries so that means that

725
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,679
batteries that came up tesla or

726
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,919
batteries that came off of scooter pack

727
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,520
so what's what's the difference between

728
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,960
both of those well so

729
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,480
for new panasonic uh 3.4 amp hour

730
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,559
uh batteries um

731
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,840
you're probably gonna be paying uh 4.99

732
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,120
per battery right so if you buy

733
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,000
uh 10 of those you're already spent 50

734
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,960
bucks

735
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,520
right uh in comparison to reclaimed

736
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,559
batteries and

737
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,760
especially if you're going to start this

738
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,200
off as a project um

739
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,840
definitely

740
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,840
take a uh look at the reclaimed battery

741
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,640
cells

742
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,679
if you mess them up you it's

743
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,760
uh uh it's not going to break the bank

744
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,039
in comparison right so

745
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,039
reclaim uh lg cells at uh 3.1 amp hours

746
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,640
um you can get them for about a buck 50

747
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
uh per cell and uh i buy them

748
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,799
in packs of 40 because um that's that's

749
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,600
what the

750
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,640
scooter packs use and those come out to

751
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,000
57.50 right so you can buy 10 batteries

752
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
uh your first time or you can buy 40. so

753
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
um it's again choose your own adventure

754
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
on that

755
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,720
um the charger before you even start

756
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
your project you have to

757
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,919
come put all the 186 battery cells in

758
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,720
uh one of these chargers all right so

759
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,200
this is

760
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,640
a battery charger uh

761
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
and discharger that tells you hey

762
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,679
um what what it's first going to do is

763
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,559
uh you're going to put all your

764
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,320
batteries inside of here and then charge

765
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360
them all the way up

766
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,559
all right and this is going to do it

767
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,480
automatically

768
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,000
so once it knows that um this charger is

769
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
feeding 4.2 volts that's the charging

770
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,799
cutoff

771
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,559
it's going to start the discharge

772
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,159
process all right and

773
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,000
uh the discharge process over here you

774
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,679
can uh do different settings

775
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,080
and again what i recommend is uh three

776
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,799
uh

777
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,279
once the battery reaches three volts so

778
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,720
what it's going to tell you

779
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
at the at the end of that which takes

780
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,360
hours we're talking about uh to do

781
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
um once you start this process the

782
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,960
charge and discharge

783
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,320
from a from a discharge battery we're

784
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,520
talking about eight hours

785
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,399
for every four batteries so this is

786
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,799
going to be a long-term project

787
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,080
um and uh at the end of it uh it's

788
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,360
remember it's gonna charge the batteries

789
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,799
all the way up and then discharge them

790
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,840
all the way down

791
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,600
and at the end of it what you're looking

792
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
for is this number

793
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,480
of um at the end of the process so this

794
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
is going to tell you

795
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,480
how much milliamp hours of power

796
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,760
discharge the battery has the reason

797
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
that it's important for you to know

798
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,159
what it actually has that discharge is

799
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
because that's that's the actual

800
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,039
usable power right so

801
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,240
um there's two different uh milliamp

802
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,279
hour settings

803
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,279
uh there's the discharge rate and then

804
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,039
there's the charge rate

805
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
right and the charge rate is always

806
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,080
going to be higher

807
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,440
than the discharge rate so you always

808
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,559
want to make sure that

809
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,520
you are checking the discharge rate so

810
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
notice how the discharge rate of all

811
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,000
these

812
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,799
uh batteries are a little bit different

813
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,679
so right so

814
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,399
out of this one you got uh 2.7 amp hours

815
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
out of this one you got 2.6

816
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,520
uh this is 2.7 and this is 2.7 so

817
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,080
um once you do the uh this initial test

818
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,399
you essentially want to be able to label

819
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,760
each individual battery as closely as

820
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,559
uh as possible so i'm going to be

821
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
putting all the 2.7 amp

822
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,200
uh amp hour batteries together in in one

823
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,840
bin

824
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,159
and then the 2.6 i'm going to put it in

825
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,360
now in another bin because remember

826
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
um it's all about having everything

827
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,200
perfectly matched up and because you're

828
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,640
using reclaimed batteries

829
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,840
all of the batteries are not going to

830
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
have the same power output so

831
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
um that's another thing that you want to

832
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,519
take into account even though you

833
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,200
buy 40 batteries it doesn't mean that

834
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,880
you're necessarily going to be able to

835
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,640
use 40 batteries

836
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,480
uh for your system you might only be

837
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,919
able to use 20. you might not

838
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,320
be able to use 30 it's it's really all

839
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
up in the air

840
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,880
right but you can use them in different

841
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,960
in in different capacities different

842
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,440
projects

843
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,159
so um definitely be aware of that i

844
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,679
included a link to the charger there

845
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,770
that way um

846
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,200
[Music]

847
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,760
you can get um if you decide to follow

848
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,519
up with that project

849
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,480
um yeah perfect so

850
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,640
um this pcb board is a custom-made pcb

851
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,039
board

852
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,080
that uh this uh community has uh

853
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,080
crowdsourced together in order to not

854
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
even deal with

855
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,039
hey um i need to get x amount of power

856
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,919
out

857
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,760
um how do i uh connect batteries

858
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
how do i know that i did the series

859
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,320
connections properly how

860
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
how do i know if i'm messing this up or

861
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,519
not and this is

862
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,799
a really cool uh project

863
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,480
so essentially

864
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,559
this this this is a full diy kit

865
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,640
so these are the battery holders uh the

866
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
pcb board is what actually has all the

867
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,519
electronics to keep

868
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,840
uh everything together and um

869
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,919
[Music]

870
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,200
take the power of seven batteries

871
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
yeah seven batteries one two three one

872
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,399
two three four

873
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,600
uh together in order to output uh

874
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,760
24 volts of power uh that's usable

875
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,600
right and then over here these little um

876
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,640
soldering points um

877
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,760
we'll take a look at the video in a

878
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,640
second uh these are actual

879
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,039
um

880
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
oh man um what do you what do you call

881
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,159
that electrical box

882
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
at your house that uh shuts off the

883
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,840
power

884
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,399
this almost acts like a breaker so that

885
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,000
if at any given point one of these

886
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
batteries uh starts

887
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,200
uh pulling too much power or pushing too

888
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,480
much power uh

889
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,799
these breakers kind of um uh they're

890
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,679
made out of only

891
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,039
one wire so the second that that one uh

892
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,240
wire burns up

893
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
boom that battery is completely taken

894
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,760
out of uh

895
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,960
um out of usable power and and this is

896
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
one of the ways that

897
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,200
uh it eliminates uh

898
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,399
the risk involved in uh being able to

899
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
use these cells if you ever oops

900
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,080
uh this this is one of those things that

901
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,159
really saves you uh because it'll

902
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:36,880
automatically

903
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,240
take that um battery out of uh out of

904
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
series

905
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,519
and as long as your mod you have to have

906
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,480
monitoring system

907
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,799
uh in order to know hey one of my boards

908
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,159
just went out so

909
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,080
let me take a look at this right so

910
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,279
cool project i did a lot more soldering

911
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,360
uh because of this and

912
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,279
over here um they teach you how to get

913
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,240
uh these um

914
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
uh battery holders uh put them in the

915
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,599
back and start um

916
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,000
uh putting in the uh the soldering tape

917
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,359
uh together

918
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,399
before you do that yeah there's a

919
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,159
five amp fuse uh that's uh a

920
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,679
surface mount soldering that's uh

921
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,760
yeah that's kind of a little bit harder

922
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,119
to use all right

923
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,079
uh these are the small little wires that

924
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,560
um

925
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,239
i told you about so they're already

926
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,399
printed into the pcb

927
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,040
so if at any given point uh the the

928
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,440
first

929
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,879
uh battery position here started pulling

930
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,000
too much power

931
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,199
this tiny little cable would actually um

932
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,480
just burn up um and

933
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,119
then any any power that's coming out of

934
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,679
here wouldn't go into the overall pcb

935
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,320
so you would um drop from 24 volts

936
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,720
that these batteries are connected in

937
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,599
automatically down to

938
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,440
21 volts and you wouldn't have as much

939
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,880
power output but it would save

940
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,000
uh that battery from going nuclear and

941
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,480
and starting a fire so again uh that's

942
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,680
one of the reasons that

943
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,800
we really want to use these boards

944
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,240
so um another reason that i like

945
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,960
getting things from this place

946
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,490
specifically is because

947
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,160
[Music]

948
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,680
it already comes with all these videos

949
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,000
so if if you don't understand

950
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
if you get the pcb board and you're like

951
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,000
great excited now what um

952
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,079
the videos are there for you so again

953
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,119
really easy

954
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,599
so um i always like to use the crawl

955
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,720
walk run method

956
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,520
in a lot of these things so this is what

957
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,320
a

958
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,440
pcb board that's uh fully um

959
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,400
connected uh looks like this is uh what

960
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,040
the

961
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,079
uh 18650 cells

962
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,480
look like there's uh seven cells and

963
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,880
they're collect uh connected in series

964
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,040
right um the price of uh the kit

965
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,920
and the kit comes with the pcb board uh

966
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,359
these cables here

967
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,800
um this uh battery

968
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,520
volt meter here it does not come with

969
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,960
this you have to get this uh

970
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,440
yourself uh amazon i think it's like 12

971
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,320
bucks

972
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,680
um so the total price of this kit as you

973
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,160
see it

974
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
um already comes out to 23 volts uh 23

975
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,800
um you're pushing 24 volts of

976
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,480
power at three volts because um

977
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,320
each individual battery cell is uh

978
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,839
approximately 3.6 volts when you

979
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,359
multiply that by seven that's how you

980
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,400
get your

981
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
um uh extra 24 volts

982
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,359
and uh

983
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,800
the final power output of it is again

984
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,570
um going back to our ohms um

985
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,960
[Music]

986
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,000
uh first graph is uh you figure it out

987
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,640
by getting

988
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,599
24 volts of power right um and that's

989
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
what you're pushing out of these

990
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,760
uh two little slots right here uh 24

991
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
volts of power

992
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
at uh three point uh

993
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,200
three amps which is again um because we

994
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,720
haven't connected these batteries

995
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,839
in uh parallel yet

996
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,599
you're only gonna get a total of three

997
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,240
amps out so you have a total of uh

998
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,599
72 watts of usable power

999
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,400
right and uh the one thing there's a

1000
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,920
couple of things that we're missing

1001
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,160
here right um we're missing the charger

1002
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,240
and we'll talk about that in a second

1003
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,359
and uh this is using this is being used

1004
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,000
more or less

1005
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
as the uh load um all this is the seated

1006
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,200
dc power so there's no conversions being

1007
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,160
used here

1008
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,680
so uh this is really more or less like

1009
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,200
the um battery

1010
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,160
uh cell phone uh chargers uh the extra

1011
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
battery chargers that uh a lot of

1012
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,640
uh people have so um can you get them

1013
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,359
for cheaper

1014
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,720
you can absolutely get them for cheap

1015
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,160
that's not the point the point is uh

1016
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,480
you're

1017
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,440
you're building it you use uh uh using

1018
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,040
it to understand the concepts

1019
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,160
of uh what power

1020
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,119
uh capacity is and and how those systems

1021
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,079
work so

1022
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,839
uh once you build one of these and

1023
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,520
you're in the in the market

1024
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,680
for another one of them you can actually

1025
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
buy them out by spec and not necessarily

1026
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,839
buy

1027
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,079
which one looks the prettiest so um

1028
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,040
again really

1029
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
really good things to understand right

1030
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,240
so the walking

1031
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,640
section of this is when you connect

1032
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,760
10 of those pcb boards together

1033
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,000
and

1034
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
[Music]

1035
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,000
we said that one of these pcb ports

1036
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,640
is 24 volts right um because you have

1037
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
seven batteries connected in series

1038
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,000
then um like in the previous examples

1039
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
before

1040
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,560
uh that every pcb board

1041
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,280
counts as only one battery right and

1042
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,400
then the rest of them

1043
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
are being connected in parallel so

1044
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
you're increasing the amperage

1045
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,480
right so even though the uh voltage

1046
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,240
for each individual board is 24 volts

1047
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,599
and 3 amps now you're multiplying

1048
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,720
3 amps by 10 boards because

1049
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,400
all of these little uh golden

1050
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,040
copper connectors um those are

1051
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,160
connecting the batteries

1052
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
in parallel so that's how you're able to

1053
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,599
increase

1054
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,119
uh your final um power output from

1055
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,720
the uh 24 volts that each uh battery has

1056
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,560
um uh you multiply the 3 amps

1057
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,359
by the 10 boards you have so that's 30

1058
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,359
amps so you have a final battery

1059
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,040
that gives you 720 watts

1060
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,839
so we're almost up to a kilowatt hour

1061
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,240
with

1062
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,040
uh 10 of these boards so that's one of

1063
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,839
the things that

1064
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,440
uh we we want to keep in mind because

1065
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,040
again the the entire point is being able

1066
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,839
to

1067
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,640
make the battery and then how do you use

1068
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,760
the battery right

1069
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,880
so um

1070
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,160
once you check your cells

1071
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,000
charge them up and discharge them so you

1072
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,440
can group them up

1073
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,520
and put them into the pcb board with

1074
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,599
all of them having 2.7 amps of

1075
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,240
available power at the discharge right

1076
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,359
or 2.8

1077
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,880
um you you want to put all the

1078
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,440
like-minded by batteries in the same pcb

1079
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,240
port so

1080
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,800
once you once you do that then uh you're

1081
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,319
gonna need a charger to

1082
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,000
um actually charge this entire uh

1083
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,599
banking system because you just made the

1084
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,480
battery you didn't

1085
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,599
you make uh all the other components uh

1086
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,000
to build with it so um what what's

1087
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,880
missing out of here

1088
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,359
um uh that that doesn't come inside of

1089
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:55,920
this kit

1090
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,440
is the uh charger for the lithium-ion

1091
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,400
batteries and again

1092
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,240
uh we're gonna go over that a little bit

1093
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,160
um let's pretend this is a

1094
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,200
battery management system which actually

1095
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,640
uh takes the uh input of the

1096
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,040
discharger and redistributes it out to

1097
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,119
each individual or board here in a

1098
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,760
balanced

1099
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,520
manner that way you're not just

1100
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,319
charging this um pcb board uh wait for

1101
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,079
it to get filled up and then this board

1102
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,200
and then this one no

1103
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,560
the sec this um bms charges

1104
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,200
everything all at the same time right so

1105
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,160
again we we cannot stress the point of

1106
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,359
this needs to be perfectly balanced

1107
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,440
all together at the same time because

1108
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
this is how it works

1109
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,079
um it's either all working

1110
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,359
or none of it is working um because the

1111
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,359
second you get unbalanced that's where

1112
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:49,839
you get

1113
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,040
into um those runaway scenarios where

1114
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,760
the batteries

1115
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,960
are start where one battery starts um uh

1116
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,319
doing all the work

1117
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,480
and that's where uh you're gonna have a

1118
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,720
bad day right so

1119
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
what the other thing that's also

1120
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,720
connected into a bms power supply

1121
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,200
is that uh power inverter and this is

1122
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,960
what you're actually

1123
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,760
going to connect uh your uh telephones

1124
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,319
your

1125
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,440
um light bulbs whatever is using

1126
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,960
standard ac uh power uh connected to it

1127
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,680
right

1128
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,200
and then eventually um

1129
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
the next slide is going to be the

1130
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,560
running slide right

1131
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,240
and this is where you're actually

1132
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,160
putting uh multiple

1133
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,520
uh kits together so um this is a

1134
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,960
30 uh pcb board uh kit so

1135
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,400
this is where you're connecting

1136
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,920
30 of those kids together and um

1137
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,359
again each individual pcb board is 24

1138
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,720
volts that doesn't change

1139
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,440
um you're you're you're stacking them

1140
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,800
almost like legos

1141
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,200
which is really really simple to do um

1142
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,560
so

1143
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,800
this is such a cool project because once

1144
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,480
you understand that you can make

1145
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,960
one board all right in order to increase

1146
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,040
the power capacity all you have to do

1147
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,520
is stack them up together like a lego

1148
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,160
and

1149
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,040
you have more power and then you just

1150
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,720
repeat the same process again

1151
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,960
so it's one thing you have to learn

1152
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,000
understand and get

1153
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,800
right in order for you to start scaling

1154
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,839
up

1155
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,160
until you get a huge monster like this

1156
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,359
right so this is

1157
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,480
2.1 kilowatts of power all right so each

1158
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,960
of

1159
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,839
each individual board is 24 volts all

1160
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,800
right um

1161
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,640
these are 30 pcb ports so it's going to

1162
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,079
be 30 times

1163
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,359
the 3 amps of power that 7 batteries

1164
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,560
in series provide you

1165
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,280
which is equal to 2.1 kilowatts at 342

1166
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,960
uh dollars per kilowatt hour

1167
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,000
so um how how do we get down to this 342

1168
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,240
so uh the battery kit itself is 419

1169
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,599
uh 210 cells um

1170
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,800
so of those um reclaimed

1171
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,079
uh scooter batteries are going to be uh

1172
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,440
330 so it pretty much comes out to 100 a

1173
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,359
dollar and 43 per cell

1174
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,040
so um the total power

1175
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,400
of uh the

1176
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,839
the total price of the batteries

1177
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,839
uh that you can be uh placing inside of

1178
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,200
this plus

1179
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,079
the uh pcb boards and uh connectors

1180
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,280
gonna be 720

1181
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,839
so when you divide that by half it

1182
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,599
equals to 342

1183
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,800
uh kilowatt uh

1184
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,520
342 dollars per kilowatt hour uh that

1185
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,560
you're going to be using

1186
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,880
so now when you're using a system that's

1187
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,000
this big

1188
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,960
you want to increase uh your uh charger

1189
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,920
and also

1190
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,119
um this is really more where

1191
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,400
you're actually um getting a lot

1192
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,920
closer to a tesla battery at this point

1193
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,119
so this is where um

1194
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,200
by this time hopefully you did a lot

1195
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,400
more testing uh

1196
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,720
know and understand how these batteries

1197
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,680
uh work

1198
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,440
and how much load you can actually put

1199
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,800
on them

1200
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,480
and again um the battery by itself is

1201
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,560
isn't going to do anything um you need

1202
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,760
to be able to connect

1203
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,560
a load to it so this is going to be a

1204
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,040
pure

1205
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,119
sine wave inverter which is really

1206
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,160
important for modern electronics

1207
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,680
uh if if you were to connect a uh tv

1208
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,319
uh for example uh and it wasn't a pure

1209
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,760
sine wave uh

1210
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,240
inverter you can burn that tv up uh

1211
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,280
because of the

1212
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,359
uh non-regulated uh power that you're

1213
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,520
feeding to it so it's really important

1214
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,800
that if you when you're looking at

1215
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
inverters that you get a

1216
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,200
pure sine inverter really really

1217
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,319
important right

1218
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,560
and then this is a much bigger bigger

1219
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,520
battery bank

1220
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,560
so um there's there's a hack

1221
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,920
to use two hp server power racks

1222
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,960
um these are like uh anywhere between

1223
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,240
eight hundred one to twelve hundred

1224
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,319
watts depending on on the model that you

1225
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,119
get

1226
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,000
so you can charge this entire battery

1227
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,400
bank

1228
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,240
in three hours in comparison to using

1229
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,760
uh this uh battery bank uh charger

1230
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,760
which is only 72 amps of uh power

1231
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,240
and uh we'll cover that in a second in a

1232
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,040
little bit more

1233
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,640
uh in depth detail but again um

1234
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,720
uh what i really want you to understand

1235
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,920
is that once you build out the

1236
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,240
uh the battery you always need a way to

1237
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,079
charge it and you need a way to

1238
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,839
uh to use that power

1239
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,200
so um inverters there's

1240
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,839
uh two types of uh of inverters that

1241
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:50,720
that i found

1242
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,960
that that make the most sense uh this is

1243
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,440
just a pure sine wave

1244
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,680
pure sign uh inverter this one

1245
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,640
specifically

1246
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,240
is for um um taking in

1247
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,440
24 volts right and because our pcb

1248
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
boards are outputting 24 volts this is

1249
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,720
the type of

1250
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,760
inverter that you're going to need

1251
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,119
so this is a 2000 watt inverter so

1252
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,280
at any given point in time you can pull

1253
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,400
2 000 watts

1254
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,200
and as long as the batteries uh can uh

1255
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,720
can can handle that type of discharge

1256
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,520
rate um

1257
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,079
this will give it to you um what takes

1258
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:26,559
up

1259
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,040
2 000 watts of surge power at a time

1260
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,640
this is where we're talking about the

1261
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,520
actual air conditioning

1262
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,359
systems or a washer dryer those types of

1263
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,000
electric motors that take up a lot of

1264
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,800
power this is

1265
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,359
um this is really more what you're going

1266
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,800
to be using

1267
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,160
right um this is an all-in-one so

1268
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,359
this uh type of uh power inverter

1269
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,960
is really cool because um

1270
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,160
you can connect this uh

1271
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,000
to your battery system and this already

1272
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,160
has the battery managing system

1273
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,280
associated with the um chemical

1274
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,119
uh battery that you're using so if you

1275
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,880
were using car batteries you can uh

1276
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,640
uh set up in the settings hey i'm gonna

1277
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,480
be using lead acid batteries

1278
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,119
and this will charge uh your your

1279
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,319
battery bank

1280
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,680
by um the specific amount of uh

1281
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,680
power it actually needs in comparison to

1282
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,960
overcharging it

1283
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,040
um and causing a fire so the these are

1284
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,480
really cool systems right

1285
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,920
um it also has the uh grid tie

1286
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,520
into it so you can charge your batteries

1287
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
by the grid or if you

1288
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,760
had a solar array you'd also be able to

1289
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,880
put in uh that uh type of power into it

1290
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,720
as well as a generator so

1291
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,960
if you ever fell into that situation

1292
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,760
where

1293
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,280
um hurricane blew through and

1294
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,680
you needed power this this is the way to

1295
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,559
get that uh

1296
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,880
information out right um

1297
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,720
this is a basic um diagram of

1298
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,680
how that um uh battery system starts

1299
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,960
working right so

1300
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,800
specifically when we're looking at a

1301
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,480
system like this that already comes

1302
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,520
integrated right um the chargers

1303
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,720
is always um charging

1304
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,960
uh the battery right uh this isn't

1305
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,000
connected because

1306
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,280
as long as this is on um that this type

1307
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:25,680
of uh

1308
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,839
battery system knows it doesn't need to

1309
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,800
use the battery

1310
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,520
so it doesn't cut off this circuit right

1311
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:31,920
um

1312
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,040
the second that uh that type of system

1313
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,000
integrated system

1314
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,520
notices that there's no more power

1315
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,359
coming in so there's more charge

1316
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,280
all right the battery automatically uh

1317
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,200
completes its circuit to the inverter

1318
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,079
and um this is essentially how your

1319
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,599
standard ups

1320
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,359
uh works um and now you really

1321
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,839
understand it and have a little bit of a

1322
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:54,880
better sense of

1323
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,440
how you can incorporate the system uh

1324
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,880
either

1325
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,400
to make your own mini uh ups

1326
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,880
uh power system that can last instead of

1327
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,520
uh an

1328
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,960
hour the last eight hours 24 hours uh or

1329
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,160
creating a whole um uh power system

1330
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,319
to create your own little uh tesla

1331
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,480
battery

1332
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,160
so uh using power inverters power

1333
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,520
inverter changes

1334
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,280
uh dc current um

1335
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,559
dc power from a battery into a

1336
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,160
conventional ac current which is

1337
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,119
alternating current

1338
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,640
that you can use to operate all kinds of

1339
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
devices ac current is what you're going

1340
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,160
to use

1341
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
for most devices radios power tools

1342
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,240
microwaves kitchen appliances

1343
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,480
for example and then those power

1344
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,280
inverters

1345
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,240
do their own dc power so something that

1346
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,680
you have to be aware of

1347
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,200
uh this is the reason that you have to

1348
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,040
use an inverter when you're plugging

1349
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,400
in a regular uh appliance you can't just

1350
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,440
connect the battery to that appliance

1351
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,960
unless you know for a matter of fact

1352
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,880
that this is dc power this is dc power

1353
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,599
and this

1354
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,040
this is how i can um uh send the power

1355
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,319
over to that device

1356
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,839
all right inverse function by using

1357
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,920
unidirectional uh dc power source to

1358
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,400
mimic an alternating current

1359
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,839
power source electronic converters are

1360
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,359
essentially oscillators that rapidly

1361
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,119
switch the polarity of the dc

1362
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,359
power source which effectively creates a

1363
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,680
square wave

1364
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,640
a pure sine wave inverter is always

1365
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,000
needed for a grid tie system it's

1366
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,200
generally needed for

1367
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,559
power led tvs cfl light bulbs and

1368
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,480
inductive loads like brushless motors

1369
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,079
clocks and audio equipment will behave

1370
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,319
much better on a pure sine wave

1371
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,839
all right so again pure sine wave is

1372
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,599
really what you're looking at uh there's

1373
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,640
other inverter

1374
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,319
inverters that don't give you that pure

1375
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,319
sine wave um

1376
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,720
those are going to be a lot a lot less

1377
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,920
expensive

1378
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,040
and there are such things

1379
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,400
that they say simulated a sine wave

1380
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,000
which means that they're doing their

1381
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,920
best to give you a

1382
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,960
sine wave but it's not

1383
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,400
really a sign a pure sine wave so

1384
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,000
again b be very attentive um

1385
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,760
if you're ever looking at inverters and

1386
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,520
it says simulated sound

1387
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,599
uh sine wave that means it's not a pure

1388
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,680
sign

1389
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,599
battery charger so uh we were talking

1390
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,160
about battery charges before because um

1391
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,480
in out of every battery you're going to

1392
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,839
need a way to charge it so

1393
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,000
uh the battery uh charger that you get

1394
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,520
is going to be dependent on the battery

1395
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,440
chemistry

1396
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,000
learn what chemistry uh of a battery you

1397
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
have to uh

1398
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,839
have to pair up all right you always

1399
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,280
have to tear up the right chemistry with

1400
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,640
the correct battery right

1401
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,119
so the most common batteries are lead

1402
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:39,839
acid

1403
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,440
nickel cadmium nickel metal hydride and

1404
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,359
lithium ion batteries

1405
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,400
lead acid battery charger cannot charge

1406
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,319
a lithium ion ion battery charger

1407
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,440
all right so really important

1408
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,280
because the chemistries of each

1409
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,640
individual battery have

1410
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,680
different behaviors so um

1411
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,920
this is all covered in that book i would

1412
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,880
have

1413
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,079
never known um what the difference is or

1414
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,480
why uh it would cause a fire had i not

1415
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,920
read that book so again highly recommend

1416
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,720
you read

1417
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,760
the book all right overcharging can

1418
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,480
cause a fire

1419
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,119
that's another way that you're gonna

1420
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,040
have a bad time

1421
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,880
and again pair the charger for the

1422
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,400
battery configuration that you're using

1423
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,599
um i included two chargers here

1424
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,760
uh this is a okay 58.8 watts

1425
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,720
of uh of power so uh we get that again

1426
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,119
by

1427
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,680
multiplying the volts available in

1428
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,319
output

1429
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,880
all right this is outputting 29.4 volts

1430
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,319
by 2 amps

1431
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,520
all right um giving us a total of

1432
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,680
58.8 watts of power so

1433
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,880
you can use this to charge the

1434
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,200
uh walk or the craw uh methods of uh

1435
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,240
of batteries um it's gonna take a lot

1436
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,680
longer to charge uh a

1437
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,319
a system like this but again if you're

1438
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,400
just starting out this is

1439
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,599
this is like a 30 battery charger

1440
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,839
and if you actually start looking at how

1441
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,280
much battery chargers are

1442
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,800
for this type of um

1443
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,400
experiment they can get stupid expensive

1444
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,079
uh like um

1445
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,800
you see char chargers for lithium ion

1446
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,559
batteries up in the 300

1447
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,920
range and if you ever have or have dealt

1448
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,400
with

1449
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,079
an electric bike um and its charger uh

1450
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,359
you know that those chargers are

1451
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,000
anywhere from 150 to 200 bucks it's

1452
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,440
it it really gets weird so um

1453
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,480
this this one's like 30 bucks and it'll

1454
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,440
charge

1455
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,599
right and uh this will give you enough

1456
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,640
power to

1457
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,839
uh maybe a day of backup uh power

1458
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,079
uh depending on what you uh what you use

1459
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,119
it with

1460
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,799
right so you you'll definitely be able

1461
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,720
to charge your laptop a couple of times

1462
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,240
you'll definitely be able to

1463
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,280
to run a tv for let's say eight hours

1464
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,200
so again it's it's really being able to

1465
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,720
uh run your your core critical systems

1466
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,200
like

1467
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,160
uh i know a couple of friends that have

1468
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
um

1469
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,200
uh fish tanks and if you ever start like

1470
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,240
a serious

1471
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,280
fish tank you've invested

1472
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,319
thousands of dollars in into that so

1473
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,640
um this is one of those systems that you

1474
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,000
can use in order to keep like an

1475
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,280
aquarium running

1476
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,640
for uh five five days if that's how long

1477
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,400
you lose power for so

1478
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,559
definitely something um that you can use

1479
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:45,839
in that type of capacity

1480
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,280
i personally just want to keep the

1481
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,599
lights on so if i keep if

1482
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,440
i'm able to if it takes me a week to

1483
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,920
charge this type of a battery system

1484
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,240
uh this will actually take more like two

1485
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,839
days to charge fully

1486
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,960
um but i can use that power for a week

1487
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,599
because i'm

1488
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,799
only using it to turn on the tv maybe uh

1489
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,680
once an hour uh for maybe for one hour

1490
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,240
every day

1491
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
and then i use the rest of that power to

1492
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,079
keep the lights on in the house

1493
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,359
it's it's gonna go a long way

1494
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,400
all right um these are the uh this is

1495
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,920
another hack that you can do

1496
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,000
right so um server

1497
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,480
power supplies are anywhere between 800

1498
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,480
to 1200 watts of power

1499
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,599
and there's a way to use the full

1500
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,119
800 uh or 1200 watts

1501
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,480
ah this one gets a little bit yeah

1502
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,520
um so what they did here is they

1503
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,799
actually

1504
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,000
uh took a look at the schematics of uh

1505
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,160
of these power supplies and then they

1506
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,960
jump these pins

1507
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,319
um so that when you connect uh

1508
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,119
the positive and negative uh cables of

1509
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,400
this you can actually just

1510
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,599
pull a straight up uh 800 watts at all

1511
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,799
times

1512
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,319
um this is

1513
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,359
really what you're um so each you can

1514
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,200
buy these power supplies for about 50

1515
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,319
bucks so

1516
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,640
it's definitely a way to save money on

1517
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,480
the power chargers

1518
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,359
um but again a lot more risk that is

1519
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,880
involved to it because you're

1520
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,280
you're talking about handling uh a lot

1521
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,799
of power with this but

1522
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,160
um uh this is what uh the

1523
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,480
community as a whole is uh recommending

1524
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,000
this what they're doing there's plenty

1525
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,960
of videos

1526
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,680
that uh you can uh read about and use

1527
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,000
but

1528
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,480
um yeah this this is really where it

1529
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,319
gets more to the scary part

1530
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,640
i have these but i haven't like

1531
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,599
connected them

1532
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,480
uh in series or done uh the jumpers yet

1533
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,440
just because

1534
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,319
i don't feel as comfortable uh yet i

1535
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,760
want to be able to

1536
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,240
like do a full long term um

1537
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,960
session with these before i uh i go just

1538
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,920
like full hand

1539
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,280
in the beginning all right um so

1540
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,160
in the event that you don't um uh uh

1541
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,000
want to solder two power connectors from

1542
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,480
a

1543
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,760
power supply uh this big uh they they

1544
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,880
have these um

1545
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,000
inverted well these connectors right

1546
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,839
here that

1547
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,359
automatically uh reroute that power that

1548
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,000
way so

1549
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,280
i think these are like 50 bucks each um

1550
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,880
a little bit more expensive it'll bring

1551
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,640
you the overall cost to

1552
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,839
uh of these chargers more of the 200

1553
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,000
range but it doesn't matter because um

1554
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,599
again if you don't feel that comfortable

1555
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,440
200 bucks in comparison to

1556
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,760
burning up your house small price to pay

1557
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,960
at the end of the day right so

1558
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,720
um this literally just slides on

1559
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,599
to uh the power supply uh blades right

1560
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,440
here

1561
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,799
and boom you're you're ready to go as um

1562
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,200
as soon as you connect um your your

1563
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,240
cables

1564
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,520
uh to this you're positive and you're

1565
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,440
negative boom uh you're you're ready to

1566
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,440
go on this

1567
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,720
right uh so again this this is why

1568
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,640
uh this is an example of how you would

1569
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,040
pair up the correct charger so

1570
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,400
we have two uh power supplies uh these

1571
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,319
would be connected to the battery uh but

1572
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:24,480
again in between the battery there's a

1573
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,079
battery management system that you're

1574
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,079
connecting this to that's the one that

1575
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,280
actually handles the

1576
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,240
input and the output of the power to

1577
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,880
charge

1578
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,440
everything at the same time because

1579
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,160
you're using

1580
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,520
all the batteries at the same time

1581
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,119
you're not using just one blade or two

1582
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,240
blades you're using

1583
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,040
all of them all right uh bms

1584
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,520
so uh bms uh this is what they look like

1585
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,079
uh

1586
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,480
these are the battery management systems

1587
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,760
uh this is what controls

1588
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,599
uh the balance charging of each

1589
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,119
individual device

1590
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,319
so for um the way it's working here

1591
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,440
is that um you have remember each pcb

1592
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,400
board

1593
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,839
you have to think of it as one battery

1594
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,119
so 24 volts 24 volts 24 volts 24 volts

1595
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,440
and all of that voltage is going through

1596
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,400
the same

1597
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,280
um uh connectors right here what's

1598
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,000
increasing the

1599
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,880
amperage is because these are connected

1600
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,000
in parallel so

1601
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,760
if you notice this is the negative and

1602
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,520
this is the positive

1603
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,160
of each individual board and again it's

1604
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,400
the same thing over here negative

1605
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,119
and positive and all of these connectors

1606
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:29,440
are

1607
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,640
uh copper screws that uh get connected

1608
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,000
together and that's how you have the

1609
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,960
parallel

1610
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,119
uh connection and while all the

1611
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,160
batteries

1612
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,079
in each individual pcb board are

1613
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,880
connected in series so

1614
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,920
um these pcb boards make it

1615
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,640
incredibly simple for you to just set it

1616
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,760
and forget it

1617
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,880
um you can come in pop in uh

1618
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,119
the uh the batteries connect them up and

1619
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,240
just increase

1620
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,520
the power capacity there

1621
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,599
um so what's what's the point of all

1622
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:04,079
this

1623
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,640
how how do we get to battery um how how

1624
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,200
does it

1625
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,400
how how do we actually use the power

1626
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:10,960
that's

1627
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,000
involved in there so um i like to think

1628
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,480
of it

1629
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,839
as a one kilowatt so

1630
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,400
this is where you take a look at your uh

1631
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,359
tv

1632
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,200
and you connect a kilowatt um

1633
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,319
power meter to figure out okay hey um my

1634
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,040
tv

1635
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,559
takes 30 watts of power while it's on so

1636
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,920
per hour right it's only using 30 watts

1637
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,599
um of uh of uh of power

1638
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,480
right so how long until it gets to one

1639
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,520
kilowatt is

1640
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,079
how much usable power i'm uh i'm going

1641
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,799
to have

1642
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,200
all right so a kilowatt otherwise known

1643
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,720
as a kilowatt hour is a way to measure

1644
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,760
how much energy

1645
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,839
energy you're using it's not the number

1646
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,039
of watts that you're

1647
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,280
using in an hour even though it seems

1648
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,720
like that would make sense a kilowatt

1649
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,160
hour equals to the amount of energy you

1650
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,200
would use by keeping

1651
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
1 000 watt appliance running for one

1652
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,480
hour uh in metric 1000 equal to kilo so

1653
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,240
1000 watts equals to a kilowatt

1654
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,559
for instance if you turned on a 100 watt

1655
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,359
uh bulb

1656
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,440
it would take 10 hours to use one

1657
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,039
kilowatt hour of energy

1658
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,520
a 2000 watt appliance on the other hand

1659
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,480
would only take

1660
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,880
half an hour and it all comes down to

1661
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,400
dividing the number of watts in an

1662
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,400
appliance into 1000 to get that

1663
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,440
kilowatt hour so this is a chart that um

1664
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,359
i got that more or less tells you hey if

1665
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:30,559
you create a battery

1666
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,440
uh that's one kilowatt hour which is

1667
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,000
more or less

1668
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,880
uh uh the baseline before you uh before

1669
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,200
you

1670
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,640
start getting into the big stuff this

1671
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,559
this is more or less how much you

1672
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,119
uh you would be able to how much power

1673
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,480
how much usable power you'd be able to

1674
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,520
get out of it right

1675
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,039
so a large tv like this um with one

1676
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,960
kilowatt hour power you'd be

1677
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,240
able to rent for uh 11 hours amazon echo

1678
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,839
330 hours

1679
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,799
a ceiling fan 16 hours so you know for

1680
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,240
talking about

1681
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,280
um a hurricane scenario where all of the

1682
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:03,760
uh

1683
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,559
power is gone you this is more or less

1684
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:07,119
um

1685
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,559
what you should expect to uh get out of

1686
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,680
that battery before

1687
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,720
it uh runs out of juice

1688
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,079
so um that's the overall goal

1689
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,400
it it's in order to get to get the

1690
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,079
charger connected to the

1691
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,520
bms um in order to um

1692
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,440
properly maintain that battery uh

1693
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,119
connected to the inverter and then use

1694
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,240
it um

1695
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,680
connect that inverter over to the light

1696
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,440
bulb to the tv to the fan to

1697
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,880
whatever um load

1698
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,079
you need to power uh building out a diy

1699
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,960
lithium ion battery will allow you to

1700
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,799
have a ups for the entire

1701
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,640
home and again it's scalable right so

1702
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,799
um i'm not in comparison to the tesla

1703
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,160
power wall you're not putting in

1704
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,599
a full 13 000 uh dollars um

1705
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,440
into a system like this you can build it

1706
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,119
out a kilowatt

1707
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,760
uh per uh per year so you know if you

1708
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,720
have a home

1709
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,440
um imagine you're spending one thousand

1710
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,079
dollars

1711
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,640
every year in order to increase that

1712
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,160
power by the end of five years you

1713
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:12,720
already have

1714
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,520
five kilowatts which will be enough to

1715
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,160
actually

1716
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,359
um survive more or less pretty

1717
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,079
comfortably

1718
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,119
um in an event where you you are out of

1719
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:23,760
power

1720
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,960
for an extended amount of time and again

1721
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,520
that that

1722
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,559
always leads you up to the ability to uh

1723
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,839
hook up more uh solar arrays

1724
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,400
into your home all right um i found this

1725
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,039
project

1726
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,079
really really great um to uh increase

1727
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,599
your hardware skills and start working

1728
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,720
on more hardware

1729
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,039
uh related projects what it actually

1730
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:45,920
came down to

1731
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,200
was um once you understand what

1732
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,799
uh the power requirements of an electric

1733
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,839
device devices then you can start

1734
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,200
looking at the pcb board

1735
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,640
like uh something as simple as a

1736
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,039
raspberry pi right and start figuring

1737
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:01,440
out

1738
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,960
oh the reason that it's um a raspberry

1739
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,680
pi

1740
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,440
is using 15 watts of power is because

1741
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,039
this processor is using

1742
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,880
10 watts of power and then all these

1743
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,240
other little components for

1744
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,799
the leds and everything else uh take up

1745
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:15,760
another five

1746
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,640
uh five watts so um you start tracing

1747
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,319
that you start figuring things out

1748
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,760
for sound systems really really cool um

1749
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,079
you figure out how to replace uh laptop

1750
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,520
batteries replace old

1751
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,400
power tool batteries which is really a

1752
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,200
huge ad

1753
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,200
um plus because uh lithium-ion batteries

1754
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,960
when when you buy them brand new again

1755
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,240
super expensive but

1756
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,920
you can cut down your cost if you

1757
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,440
understand how

1758
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,079
uh the entire process works and again

1759
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,200
these batteries are in

1760
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,599
so many more things um there's projects

1761
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:48,640
that

1762
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,440
allow you to turn old laptop uh monitors

1763
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,520
into portable monitors which is always a

1764
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,680
huge plus

1765
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,880
um projects uh that allow you to create

1766
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,000
your own bluetooth

1767
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,079
amplifier so instead of buying another

1768
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,799
ue boom you can make your own ue boom

1769
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,200
and uh just for purpose uh everyday all

1770
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,920
the electronic stuff

1771
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,480
um i did the i i did this presentation

1772
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,200
uh about six months ago and then over

1773
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,400
christmas

1774
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,880
um some of these things went like

1775
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,680
severely

1776
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,119
lower in price right and what we have

1777
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:29,520
here is an integrated system that

1778
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,680
does everything for you all right uh

1779
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,559
these uh

1780
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,839
come out to uh 350 bucks

1781
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,400
but it's everything in a small form

1782
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,079
package ready to go

1783
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,240
right um it already has all of the

1784
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,920
batteries integrated into it you can

1785
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,319
charge it with a

1786
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,520
car battery car cigarette lighter here

1787
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,680
you have three outlets ready to go you

1788
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,119
have a fast charge port you have other

1789
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:53,599
usb

1790
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,640
tour ports you have a usbc port in order

1791
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,559
to charge

1792
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,680
usbc devices um at a rapid charge

1793
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,880
it's uh 288 watt hours of um

1794
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,039
uh capacity right so for example if

1795
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,000
you're running a

1796
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,520
[Music]

1797
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,640
fan right that uses 30 watts of

1798
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,319
power you can use you can run that for

1799
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,160
about eight hours using one of these you

1800
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,799
can charge

1801
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,760
multiple laptops um so this is a really

1802
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,319
cool

1803
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:25,680
um uh device that includes

1804
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,319
all of the knowledge that you just

1805
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:28,880
gained

1806
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
and gives it to you automatically and

1807
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,640
you can also charge this

1808
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,920
uh via the the grid so just by plugging

1809
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,000
into an ac outlet you can use solar

1810
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,960
power

1811
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,680
out of it and you can even just uh again

1812
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,599
charge it with your car bms is included

1813
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,240
into it

1814
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,160
uh the pure sine wave inverter is

1815
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,839
already included into it so

1816
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,359
uh this is uh a a a

1817
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,480
really nice way to get into um uh the

1818
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,000
project and

1819
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,839
um again even if you don't want to deal

1820
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:00,480
with

1821
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,559
having a um uh

1822
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,440
a generator right during a hurricane uh

1823
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,280
that'll cost you about 500 bucks this is

1824
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,240
350

1825
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,559
you spend another 200 uh bucks and get

1826
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,280
the solar panels connected to it and

1827
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,520
now in the event that a hurricane comes

1828
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,520
through you'll be able to power

1829
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,479
uh again small devices uh you can power

1830
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,080
a tv for a couple of hours

1831
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,920
and then recharge it uh the next day

1832
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,439
with solar power without

1833
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,640
having to worry about um

1834
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,439
gas shortages or anything of that sort

1835
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:34,238
and uh

1836
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:35,839
if you have a drone right and you want

1837
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,479
to take it out to the park like these

1838
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,399
this is what you want to use in order to

1839
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,640
be able to recharge uh those batteries

1840
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,640
if you're going camping this is amazing

1841
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,120
tailgating again it's super cool

1842
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,040
and uh these are all the parts lists

1843
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,640
that are uh

1844
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,920
i it um

1845
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,359
the diy battery book again

1846
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,120
super uh big requirement for sure

1847
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,839
without that

1848
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:05,120
uh i i wouldn't have uh

1849
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,238
i probably would have burnt down

1850
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,520
something um

1851
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,198
[Music]

1852
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,238
without me reading this book before um i

1853
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,399
i know i was taking out some drone

1854
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,399
batteries and those come in lithium-ion

1855
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,359
pouches

1856
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,439
and by mistake i was using some tweezers

1857
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:20,640
to take out a

1858
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,799
connector and i connected

1859
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,399
the the tweezers to the negative and

1860
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,080
positive of it and

1861
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,198
they like lit up immediately like within

1862
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,640
less than a second

1863
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,158
um and uh instead of two

1864
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,679
sharp ends i had two bulbs at the end

1865
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:40,399
because that's

1866
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,759
that's how quick um and how much power

1867
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,399
uh these batteries have so um you

1868
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,080
definitely don't want uh

1869
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,279
that learning curve um this is uh this

1870
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,920
is um this is where to get the

1871
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,280
lithium-ion battery packs

1872
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,159
right so they're going for 5750 per 40

1873
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:58,560
cell

1874
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,120
uh pack um the diy uh battery kit so

1875
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,120
this is where you get all of the pcb

1876
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,320
boards all the pieces all of the

1877
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,320
connectors

1878
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,440
um the

1879
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,920
the regular the small battery charger uh

1880
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,040
the big

1881
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,280
um hp power supplies from the servers

1882
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,679
uh a dc to dc regulator that's what

1883
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,600
you're going to need to use later on

1884
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,199
a adapter that's what you connect the

1885
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:30,800
um server rack mount over to oh well so

1886
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,080
that's what you connect

1887
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,239
uh instead of soldering those two cables

1888
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,440
in the

1889
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,000
um hp power supplies that's what you

1890
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,040
would use in order to

1891
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,280
just uh completely bypass that power

1892
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,080
meter extend standard regular hey

1893
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,440
how about how much current am i pulling

1894
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,520
out just andrew um

1895
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,440
this is a really great resource for part

1896
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,600
the uh mobile solar power

1897
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,199
uh super good um

1898
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,199
this this tells you about plug and play

1899
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,679
programs uh do-it-yourself systems that

1900
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,280
already comes with parts and that way

1901
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,080
you don't have to do

1902
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,520
any of the guesswork that's where i get

1903
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,760
a lot of my um graphics from

1904
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,760
and if you're saying hey you know this

1905
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,040
is a great project

1906
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,880
but i don't want to deal with the pain

1907
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,800
and the hassle of

1908
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,560
building a battery i just want the

1909
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,159
battery

1910
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,000
and connect all the pieces together

1911
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,640
there's a place called bigbattery.com

1912
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,239
where

1913
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,000
they'll automatically build the battery

1914
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,560
for you um

1915
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,679
this is made out of uh lithium

1916
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,920
something something cells uh but

1917
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,159
essentially the the lipo cells are

1918
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:41,040
lithium ion cells no you know what

1919
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,440
90 on that they're lithium-based but

1920
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,800
uh yeah lithium-ion phosphate battery

1921
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,920
um these are super stable these these

1922
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,239
batteries are the preferred batteries uh

1923
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,679
the preferred chemistry because um

1924
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,960
you can uh they're really hard to mess

1925
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,080
up even if uh

1926
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,920
if if one battery is doing most of the

1927
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,520
work um

1928
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,000
the the battery itself will will won't

1929
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,640
have that

1930
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,040
nuclear uh reactor where it's just gonna

1931
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,760
heat up heat up

1932
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,120
to heat up and then um cause a fire so

1933
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,440
this is one of those chemistries that

1934
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,960
comes automatically done for you

1935
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,080
and this pack is 2.2 kilowatt hours

1936
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,480
right so in the um for 1100 bucks so

1937
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,320
instead of uh getting it for

1938
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,760
uh 342 you're paying 500 bucks but you

1939
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,280
didn't do any of the assembly and it's

1940
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,040
ready to go so you'd

1941
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,440
uh hook this battery up to uh your

1942
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,040
inverter and your charger paired up

1943
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,679
correctly

1944
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,880
and um so you understand

1945
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,360
the the concepts of it uh you'd be able

1946
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,640
to get it

1947
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,000
and uh yeah that's it uh let me know if

1948
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,840
anybody has any questions

1949
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,679
thank you very much for such a great

1950
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,120
presentation any questions

1951
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,440
uh this light deck

1952
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,400
yeah the slide is already in the events

1953
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,280
and in uh

1954
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,640
the presentation uh section of the

1955
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,320
uh discord also it's all i also

1956
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,440
posted it in slack since

1957
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,840
the bot doesn't have copy file

1958
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,280
capabilities at the moment

1959
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,679
so it's in slack in the events channel

1960
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,080
as well as in the discord presentation

1961
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,360
files channel

1962
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,320
we also have a github then we save them

1963
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,440
in github too

1964
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,400
oh okay cool

1965
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,239
and um

1966
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,800
i thought that presentation was awesome

1967
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,040
in my

1968
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,840
uh francisco you built you're getting

1969
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,920
you're buying a house and gonna do your

1970
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,199
own solar array

1971
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,840
on there i mean it's it's definitely a

1972
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,880
possibility

1973
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,239
um uh now like to me it's a lot more

1974
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,120
accessible to

1975
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,719
uh be like all right i don't want to go

1976
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,480
in full ten thousand

1977
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,159
uh putting in a ten thousand dollar

1978
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,920
investment you know if i want to just

1979
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,440
keep the lights on let me get something

1980
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,199
with like two kilowatts

1981
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,880
and again um uh be comfortable enough i

1982
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,320
don't need to run everything

1983
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,600
but uh having lights is huge

1984
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,159
when nobody else does so that that

1985
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,400
that's my way of thinking

1986
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,000
now that that is completely true

1987
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,280
very cool something like that especially

1988
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,320
adding like uh making sure your internet

1989
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,239
connection stays up and a little femo

1990
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,440
tower

1991
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,920
to give you cellular service when the

1992
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,000
main towers are down

1993
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,320
yeah and i mean i i know a lot of people

1994
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,000
in in this group use the cb

1995
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,640
uh radios right and you're gonna need

1996
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,120
power

1997
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,080
to transmit and this is what will um

1998
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,560
make sure you keep that power alive

1999
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,960
during the last uh hurricane season when

2000
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,719
i was down in homestead

2001
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,080
not the last hurricane uh a couple

2002
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,920
hurricane seasons back

2003
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,760
when we got when we got hit it was uh

2004
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,400
and all the cell towers were down my

2005
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,880
little femmo tower kept us up and we had

2006
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
and i had people from around the

2007
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,080
community just

2008
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,640
roaming by my house and getting cellular

2009
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,840
signals so

2010
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,679
it's pretty good to have uh especially

2011
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,040
when they're that's

2012
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,679
we had power but we didn't have cellular

2013
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:26,400
service

2014
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,800
right so everyone was still out of cell

2015
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,520
phone service

2016
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,480
it's pretty good especially if you have

2017
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,440
kids

2018
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,440

doing a lot of reverse

2058
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,679
engineering and messing around with some

2059
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:18,880
hours so

2060
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,280

lot of some tips in the reversing

2062
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:23,600
channel

2063
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,600
on this board like a bunch of little

2064
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,280
projects we've been going through a

2065
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,800
bunch of uh

2066
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,679
the phone college phone.college they

2067
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,000
also have a discord channel

2068
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,800

2069
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,920
questions with in

2070
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,400
in that channel or want to do any of the

2071
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,199
reverse

2072
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,360
engineering with me i'm on actually

2073
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,800
level

2074
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,960
seven right now still going still

2075
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,159
working my way through

2076
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,840
phone college uh question set

2077
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,800
it's like a ctf style they have it with

2078
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,640
uh ctfd

2079
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,640
so you can keep track of they have an

2080
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,679
educate

2081
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,800
learning chat level and then a test

2082
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,840
level

2083
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
so one gives you a little bit of a

2084
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,440
directions and some hints and then the

2085
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,199
next one doesn't give you any directions

2086
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,159
and hints

2087
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,520
and basically it's a lot of uh r2

2088
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,560
and rate uh radar 2 and debugging so

2089
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,239
it's great to if you want to get your

2090
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,480
hands into some learning some basics of

2091
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,520
ctf

2092
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,320
i'm doing those if you anyone interested

2093
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,280
in wanting to go

2094
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,679
along with me and do some as well i'll

2095
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:28,960
be happy to give

2096
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,360
some advice on the lore and challenges

2097
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,719
as i work my way up

2098
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,719
through them as well yeah on that note

2099
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,000
um we had another member that posted up

2100
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,120
uh the uh vx underground um

2101
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,239
chat that uh um miami-dade uh cyber club

2102
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:47,120
was doing

2103
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,040
uh that was a really good presentation

2104
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,239
um there's

2105
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:53,440
um the

2106
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,800
actual malware uh samples in uh in that

2107
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,000
website and

2108
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,679
they have over 400 plus malware um

2109
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,520
samples that you can download um like

2110
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,960
real malware um

2111
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,679
and since respect you're talking about

2112
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:08,880
uh reversing things

2113
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,719
that that's that's a really good uh

2114
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,719
repository of uh

2115
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,480
new things and old things yeah

2116
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,480
after reversing a couple of pieces of

2117
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,640
real malware and then

2118
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,880
we're looking at we're just go and so

2119
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,280
uh into it and we're looking at down

2120
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,040
like oh my gosh i wish i could see the

2121
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,120
source code that generated this

2122
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,040
loop it looks so ridiculous how did

2123
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,880
how did the how did it who wrote this to

2124
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,960
make it do this

2125
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,280
you know

2126
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,440

like that they're

2128
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,080
