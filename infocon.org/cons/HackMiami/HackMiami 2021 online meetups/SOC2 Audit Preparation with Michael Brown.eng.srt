13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
if you have audits all kinds of

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,558
questions about policies

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,719

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
year classes about policies

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,280

he's going to talk about something that

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,559
i get for example approach

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,840
many times people comes to me saying

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,879
son of two can you help me with this uh

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,640
there is a lot of confusion of this and

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,680
this is why this is a great presentation

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
because for some for some reason people

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
confuse this software security

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,119
operations

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,400
um and uh you know sometimes i have

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
placed things like

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
oh no i know suck and then people will

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,040
comment

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,920
and and tell me things like how you know

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
suck you're not an accountant for

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
example that was something that

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
uh i was told i i knew that you needed

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
some sort of a

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
a cpa knowledge today we're going to

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,600
find out about it

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
because what happens is many times

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
people think that this is something that

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,400
you can do with

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
i guess many security professionals the

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,159
answer is no

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,880
uh you had to do this with very specific

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
companies have very

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
specific skill people and i am

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,399
personally looking forward to seeing

50
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,159
this presentation today

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
because uh i i

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
admit it i don't know much about uh sub

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
i'm going to make your presenter michael

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,878
the end

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,280

them and exposure to them

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,800
and so because of that i felt that i was

organizations

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
so i'm going to get some background some

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
terminology that way when you hear some

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,360
of these things

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
regarding sock 2 you know at least

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
you'll be a little bit more familiar

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
talk a little bit about what's in a sock

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,239
2 report

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,159
talk a little bit about you know why you

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,439
would use sock 2

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,159
in that's about a tool for vendor

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,360
management

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
and then probably more important for

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
hopefully some of you guys there

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,519
is what if you are faced with your

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,200
company needing to get

114
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
themselves a sock too and some of the

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,799
things that i've done in helping

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,279
you know my clients you know get ready

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,079
for that

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,918
and then i always try to give resources

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
with all my presentations

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,280

with uh stock2 assessments um

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
most most particularly i was where i

129

worked with two clients where i was

130
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,520
there referred to as a virtual cso or

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
fractional cso

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
uh to help them get sock two type two

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,479
reports

134

some over a couple years

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
developed and implemented policies and

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,919
and controls

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,440
uh making sure the evidence was being

141
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
gathered to show this

142
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
um i also want to you know as part of

143

that you know helping them with you know

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,840
security awareness training for their

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
other people i

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
description which is important part

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
report i'll

153
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
touch a little bit more on what the heck

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,039
that is and then when the

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
sock 2 assessment came in i was kind of

156
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
like the center point for that

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
in terms of lining up who the

158
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,720
assessors need to talk to working

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
directly with the assessors answering

160
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
their questions

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
uh kind of like in the middle of all of

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
that um

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
which was was quite a bit of work um

164

and of course we were successful in

165
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
getting a a good uh

166
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
soc 2 type 2 report at the end of that

167
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
uh the other company i worked with with

168
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
us which is much smaller company

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
uh dealing with what you would call

170
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
incentive programs

171
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
um if you're not aware this is where

172
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
like you know various companies will say

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,639
like

174
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,400
hey you know if you do these things and

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
you like i see a lot with some of the

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,199
health care companies

177
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,240
health insurance companies they'll say

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,919
like hey if you do these sort of things

179
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,280
we'll give you a gift card

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
so this is something that this company

181
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
would do um so i came in

182
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
uh looked at their policies and controls

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,720
this company was different they actually

184
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,520
had

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
a decent set of policies they had pretty

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
good controls already in place

187
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,400
i kind of looked over them saw some gaps

188
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,520
we

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
filled those gaps we first had you know

190
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
they first went through and did a sock

191
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
two type

192
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
one engagement that was successful and

193
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,160
then

194
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
for 12-month period we made sure that

195
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
hey we had evidence of the controls in

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
place

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
they came back for the sock two type two

198
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,919
it was a

199
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
pretty you know easy engagement because

200
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
they were you know had things pretty

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,919
well on hand and

202
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,400
got their sock to type 2 successfully

203
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
both these things were done actually

204
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,599
last last year

205
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
so one thing i you know at first part of

206
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
this i'm touching on various different

207
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,199
things i was trying to do this kind of a

208
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
logical matter but sometimes

209
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
some of the stuff it was hard for me to

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,479
like how would i put this in a logical

211
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,280
manner

212
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
so one thing i need to make clear about

213
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
is there's a difference between

214
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,840
you know i'm not sure what we should

215
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
call it assessing there's also you call

216
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,160
it

217
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
certifying and whatnot versus assisting

218
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,039
and this is the thing when you have

219
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
different organizations that come in and

220
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
certify a company or assess a company

221
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
you know to give them like a

222
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
certification for

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
iso 27001 or you know the c

224
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
the cpa firm that comes in and does the

225
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,400
sock 2 report

226
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
um if you're familiar with the new

227
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
department offenses cmmc

228
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,319
scheme uh getting certified in that

229
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,039
getting started

230
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
in high trust those entities those

231
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,639
companies that come in and do that

232
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
they cannot help that

233
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,360
company they're assessing get ready you

234
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
know they can't come along and

235
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
say like oh you know your policies

236
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,319
aren't well you know here's some

237
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
policies that you can use and this sort

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
of stuff

239
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
they have to kind of separate that out

240
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,440
um

241
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
even cmmc is very clear on that they

242
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
have

243
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
two different kind of of uh people they

244
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
have one that can come in and do the

245
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
prep work and they even have a training

246
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,879
scene for those people

247
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,120
and they have a training scheme and

248
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
certifying scheme for people who want to

249
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,680
come to and

250
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
certify and you can be both but you

251
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
can't do both

252
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
with the same company you know so if

253
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
your organization to a

254
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
if a company comes in and helps a

255
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,799
company prepare they cannot be the ones

256
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,159
doing the assessment or certification

257
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,399
so in some cases you'll have companies

258
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,519
that kind of just focus

259
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
just on the certifying assessment type

260
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
stuff

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,040
and they will leave the

262
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,600
prep work assistant type stuff to other

263
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
companies so sometimes they'll team up

264
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
with another company so the company i

265
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
was with we were more the

266
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,839
helping out versus the assessing and it

267
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
was actually kind of funny in that

268
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,560
all of our clients that were doing

269
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
getting assessed for saktu

270
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
all wound up working with the same you

271
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
know audit you know

272
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,560
audit firm um accounting firm you know

273
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
so we were like

274
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,360
doing all this assistance and it was all

275
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,800
the same authentic firms so in some

276
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,360
cases

277
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
we were kind of working you know kind of

278
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
with the same

279
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
same people but we did it we did realize

280
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
we had that separation

281
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
uh between us uh so that's what kind of

282
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,399
rod

283
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,519
talked you know mentioned was that with

284
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
this with a sock 2 report it

285
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,360
can only come from an accounting firm

286
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
you know and i've never worked with

287
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
accounting firm so i could never have

288
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,200
been

289
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
someone who's actually assessing a

290
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
company to get a sock to

291
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
but i can go and help them get ready

292
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
which is what i was doing

293
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
so what is a sock 2 report i said it's

294
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,560
actually one of several reports i'm

295
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:52,959
going to

296
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,880
talk about what those different ones are

297
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
done by accounting firms

298
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,160
you know and these are important because

299
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,839
the the sock do report is they can is a

300
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,640
report on the controls of a company

301
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
which they then use to provide to either

302
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
potential clients or

303
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
current clients to say like hey you know

304
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
we're partnering services to you

305
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,200
here's this report on those services so

306
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
that you can

307
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
trust that they are working and you can

308
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
rely upon us and so forth

309
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
so it's a way for you know clients

310
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
potential clients to say like yeah we

311
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,279
want to

312
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,720
do business with this company because

313
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
they can provide us with this

314
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,279
third party assessment of their services

315
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,880
and we can look at it and like

316
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
know that oh yeah everything is working

317
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,399
good and so forth and we can trust them

318
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,560
and we don't have to spend all our time

319
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,320
assessing that company we get this

320
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,399
this good report um and and honestly

321
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,279
this has become

322
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
more and more uh important

323
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
um and i said a lot of companies were

324
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
coming to us

325
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,279
for help you know because they need to

326
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,560
get assessed because

327
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
their clients are coming to them and

328
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,519
saying like well we're only going to do

329
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,000
business with

330
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
you if you get a a sock 2 report

331
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
or some of the other reports that are

332
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
out there like i said high trust

333
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
in healthcare iso 27001

334
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
and honestly i don't see that going away

335
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
i see it actually increasing

336
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
so again when you what what a sock sock

337
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,440
you know we we oftentimes hear sock we

338
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
think of security operation center

339
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
that's not what we're talking about uh

340
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,040
for if you're more of a techie person

341
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
you might have heard the term a system

342
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
on a chip you know like the special you

343
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,200
know the

344
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
chips in your uh smartphones and whatnot

345
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
that's not what we're talking about

346
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
uh the term sock used to mean service

347
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
organization controls

348
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
and now it's been renamed as system and

349
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
organization controls

350
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
so and sometimes when people say soccer

351
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,880
i had to think are you talking about a

352
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,839
security operation center are you

353
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,519
talking about a sock report

354
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
so that's sort of the things

355
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,480
so what do we mean by a service

356
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,760
organization and this is actually a

357
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
quote from

358
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,079
the documents it's an organization

359
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
reporting services to what they call a

360
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,680
user entity that's basically a a another

361
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
client or company

362
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
you know for which these servers are

363
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
likely to be relevant

364
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,920
to those companies because it has an

365
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,880
impact on you know finances and so forth

366
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
in terms of a sock too this would be

367
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
things like they're providing

368
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,839
financial services as billing and

369
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,680
processing and payload like

370
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
you know we're a small company and you

371
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
know instead of us hiring an accountant

372
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,959
to do this sort of stuff

373
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
oh we'll just use this application from

374
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,480
adp

375
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
or someone else okay great if we're

376
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
replying it relying upon that

377
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
uh let's get a report you know that's

378
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
gonna be doing good

379
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
um and more the tecla know stuff we'll

380
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
see you know people who are doing

381
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
sas services cloud computing

382
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
virtualization

383
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
you know i'm i'm instead of me building

384
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
a data center i'm going to go and house

385
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,320
my servers

386
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600
in you know rackspace or paramark or

387
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,079
whatever

388
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,480
i want to know that those systems will

389
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,079
be protected and so forth

390
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,440
you know i'm relying upon another third

391
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
party for web hosting cloud computing so

392
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
if i'm whether i'm using

393
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
aws or azure or google cloud or what

394
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
have you i want to know that's that's

395
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
going to be taken care of and if you go

396
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,480
to these different companies

397
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
they will actually have on their website

398
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,079
yes we have

399
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,440
all these different reports and

400
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
certifications and so forth you go to

401
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,800
you know aws they have a good aws i have

402
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
like a compliance page where you can see

403
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,839
a list of all the different

404
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
certifications and

405
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
attestations and whatnot you know

406
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
they've got you know a sock one two and

407
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,760
three report

408
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,399
and they're iso 27001 certified and

409
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:32,959
they're

410
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
high trust their pci and yada yada these

411
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
companies get these things because

412
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
they know it's a good selling point you

413
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
know that way they have it

414
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
you know you can then you know use a

415
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,480
potential client

416
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
can trust that things are good because

417
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,399
they've got they've spent the time and

418
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
money to get these reports

419
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,680
and you can go and check them out

420
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
so i mentioned that with you know there

421
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,800
is more than one

422
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
sock report and so aicpa that's american

423
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,480
institute of

424
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
certified public accountants they're the

425
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,920
ones that had this and they called they

426
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,120
now called their

427
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
suite of services and at this point

428
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
there's actually five different reports

429
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,480
there's sock one

430
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
two and three uh sock one is

431
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,440
about financial reporting so i don't

432
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,760
have

433
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
much experience with that because i

434
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,880
really don't really get into you know

435
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,800
the financial side of things

436
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,279
uh sock two is what we're talking about

437
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,959
here and that's one i have experience

438
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,519
with

439
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,959
this what's good what they get in what

440
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
they call trust services controls

441
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560
which is security availability process

442
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,440
integrity

443
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,959
confidentiality or privacy

444
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,079
you know and stock one and 2 have what's

445
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
called a type 1 report and a type 2 port

446
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,320
i'll talk about that a little bit more

447
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
shortly there's also a sock 3

448
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
which is basically sock 1 and 2 have a

449
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,440
lot of very sensitive information

450
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,399
so because of that you can't get a sock

451
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,760
one or two report

452
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,199
unless you sign an nda

453
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
so if you go to a company that has these

454
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
they will say on the website they have

455
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,279
them

456
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
but they're not going to put them there

457
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,279
you know if you want them you'll have to

458
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,480
contact them directly

459
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,920
and maybe agree to or sign off on an nda

460
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,160
um where the sock 3 is more general use

461
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,600
so they could actually put that on a

462
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,199
website

463
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,920
i know for myself i actually got aws

464
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,279
sock2 report

465
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
because i used to have a free aws

466
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,279
account you know so i had kind of like

467
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,800
you know kind of signed off on things

468
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
and i can actually go and access it and

469
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,920
you know i had to then kind of like you

470
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
know sign off i got on the nda

471
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
and get their sock 2 report um but one

472
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,279
and two

473
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
are under under ndas so that's why

474
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,320
they're kind of restricted

475
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
uh there's also socktube or cyber

476
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
security that's kind of a new one

477
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
and i've never seen one of these yet not

478
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
have anyone asked for them

479
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
um though i am familiar with it i've

480
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
looked at it i've gotten the book on it

481
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,839
actually did a present

482
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
presentation on it um but don't know

483
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,279
people doing it

484
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,959
and the newest one is this new one for

485
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,720
vendor supply chain

486
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,759
which gets into you know

487
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,000
production manufacturing distribution so

488
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
these are for

489
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
you know sock 2 is good for a company

490
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,320
kind of providing

491
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,839
services that get into these you know

492
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
security and whatnot whereas the vendor

493
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
management this is more for a company

494
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,320
that's doing

495
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
you know you're building something

496
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
you're producing something

497
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,959
in the supply chain and you want to be

498
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,480
able to show that hey you got controls

499
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,519
about that

500
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,440
um i don't know much more about that

501
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
that's when fairly recent

502
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
i know that up until very recently it

503
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,440
was always coming soon

504
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
so i mentioned the type 1 and type 2 and

505
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,959
one thing i should mention i've seen a

506
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,079
lot of time people will

507
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
will write these as roman numerals so

508
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
some of they'll see type 2

509
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
it was as a type roman numeral 2 which

510
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
is really not correct but

511
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
i see that a lot a type one is basically

512
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,199
reported

513
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,000
as a point in time they come in take a

514
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,839
look at the controls

515
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,519
give your report but there's no

516
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
guarantee that those report those

517
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,639
controls have been

518
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
in place for a period of time so you

519
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
know so it's like well maybe they

520
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,599
they put them in place two days ago

521
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,559
you don't know because it was there's no

522
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,000
you know a period of time

523
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
type 2 is more valuable it's over a

524
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,919
period of time

525
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,599
so not only they look at the control but

526
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
they look at evidence going

527
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,919
back you know a previous period of time

528
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
now i always was told it was

529
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,319
9 to 12 months some of the things i'm

530
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,799
hearing is that it could be as short as

531
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,600
as three months which honestly i don't

532
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,080
feel

533
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,400
there's much value because what most

534
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,080
companies want is they want a type 2

535
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,799
report

536
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
that's from the past 12 months yeah so

537
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,280
like three months is like

538
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,600
that's not too good unless you're then

539
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
gonna

540
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
you know do another report very quickly

541
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,919
for a 12-month period

542
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,520
and every time you do a have someone

543
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,919
come in and do a sock 2 report

544
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,960
that's time and money so

545
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
most times it's it's 12 months and

546
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
usually once a company starts getting a

547
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,559
type 2 report

548
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,720
it's going to become an annual thing you

549
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,679
know you did it

550
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,559
last year you know in august you know

551
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
hey they're going to come by again

552
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,000
in preparation for giving you a new

553
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,720
report for august of this year

554
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
and you know and so forth so it becomes

555
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
a cycle of it

556
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
and that's also important because like

557
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
if someone gives you a tight you know

558
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
sock two report

559
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,280
you know and it's like older than 12

560
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
months old you're like

561
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,200
uh where's the newest one are you in the

562
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,080
process

563
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
you know let me get a can we get what's

564
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,360
called a bridge letter because

565
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
you know that's kind of the expectation

566
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
and i'll talk a little bit more about

567
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
you know what we mean what they're

568
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,840
looking for in terms of evidence and so

569
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,880
forth

570
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
so as i said these are the five trust

571
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
you know

572
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
criteria security availability

573
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
processing integrity confidentiality and

574
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,919
privacy

575
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,440
now one thing anything about these five

576
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
is you don't have to do

577
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,520
all five um my understanding was always

578
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
that kind of like the default

579
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,039
three was you want to do security

580
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
availability confidentiality

581
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,480
if you need to typically because your

582
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
clients are demanding it

583
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,039
you might do process integrity maybe

584
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,840
privacy

585
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
uh one of my clients unfortunately they

586
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
were like basically told you know we

587
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
went all five

588
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
you know and the assessor was even

589
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
saying you know

590
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
because they're they're being pretty

591
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
decent about they're like you know you

592
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,760
know

593
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,559
what criteria do you need because you

594
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,760
know if we can

595
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
keep it to a minimum we can keep your

596
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
costs low you know which is decent than

597
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,559
to be

598
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
to have that you know you know attitude

599
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
and they were forced to do all through

600
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,919
five uh security as i understand you you

601
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,520
must do security there's no way out of

602
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,080
it

603
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
all the other four is optional

604
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
um but my my thinking has always been

605
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,039
security availability confidentiality on

606
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
the basic ones

607
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
processing integrity may not really

608
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
apply for some companies

609
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
privacy same thing so if you don't need

610
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
to don't do it

611
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,159
in addition when you look at the list of

612
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,120
the controller there's actually

613
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
additional additional controls

614
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
in the four that again are optional

615
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,600
you know that's something that people

616
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
sometimes don't realize when they get

617
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,559
the list of the

618
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
trust like you know the the controls as

619
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,000
i look at it there's like

620
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
over a hundred like oh god we gotta do

621
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
all of these i'm like no no no no you

622
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
don't um you know you can actually you

623
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,520
know

624
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
the assessors will work with you and say

625
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,799
okay these are what's important what are

626
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,679
appropriate

627
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,280
these aren't these don't really apply to

628
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
you you know and and so forth and so you

629
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,280
wind up doing like a

630
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,080
more of a subset of them um i think most

631
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,640
of us

632
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,919
know what we mean by security

633
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,720
availability means hey this is available

634
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
confidentiality you're protecting

635
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
confidential data privacy

636
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
you know it's optional because not

637
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
everyone will collect

638
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,679
you know personal information from

639
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,080
people uh and processing integrity if

640
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,799
you're not really

641
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,039
processing information if you just kind

642
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,400
of like you know

643
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
taking and using it not making changes

644
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,760
to it then

645
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,120
it's not really applicable

646
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,320
um so what are these reports based upon

647
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,919
and i meant brought this because i hear

648
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
these terms as well

649
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
they're basing upon a series of

650
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,280
accounting standards um

651
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
so when i first started getting exposed

652
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
to this i always heard sas70

653
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
um and that was you know statement on

654
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
auditing standards so

655
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
it was sas 70 was a standard for a sock

656
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
2 report for many many years

657
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
i know when i started forgetting that i

658
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,880
heard that all the time 770

659
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,120
you know that was replaced by ssae

660
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
16 you know to see statement on

661
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,080
standards of attestation examinations

662
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,440
really really fun uh term which

663
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,799
um went in effect in like 2010 2011

664
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,000
however it's been replaced as you see by

665
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,240
ssae 18 as of

666
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,200
2017 which is you know

667
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
almost four years ago yet i find it

668
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
funny is i still see people

669
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,240
making reference to ssae 16 and it's

670
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
like

671
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
come on that was for freaking years ago

672
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
get up with the times

673
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
you know sort of like someone still

674
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,520
talking about windows 95 when it's like

675
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
we're on windows 10 now i think you need

676
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,720
to get up to date

677
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,799
and if you're really a gun for

678
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,240
punishment you can actually get these

679
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,360
documents

680
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
and read them there are they are really

681
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,840
boring

682
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
so uh you have been

683
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,000
um i've been i've touched i've mentioned

684
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,280
control several times i just want to

685
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,480
make sure people understand what the

686
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,760
heck i mean by

687
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,000
controls because unfortunately sometimes

688
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
people don't

689
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
um you know basically there are

690
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,679
activities performed by a person or a

691
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,320
system

692
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
designed to ensure that certain

693
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
objectives are being met yeah get it

694
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
yeah yeah get it get it get it get it

695
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
get it hello hello

696
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,159
someone needs to go on mute um so these

697
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,919
kind this term comes from the idea of

698
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,080
internal controls for for businesses

699
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
um and but of course we we in infosec

700
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,120
are really

701
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,600
not under fall under i.t so we really

702
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,320
talk about i.t

703
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,080
controls for ourselves and there's

704
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,440
actually a term called i t

705
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,039
general controls itgc and it application

706
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,679
controls

707
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,080
you can actually um if you want to know

708
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
more about this there's actually a

709
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,840
decent

710
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
wikipedia article on it and itgc

711
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
include topics such as change management

712
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
you know source code version control you

713
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
know stuff uh

714
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
software development life cycle incident

715
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,640
management

716
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
disaster recovery backups and things

717
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,919
like that things that

718
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,880
you know we as it infosec people do deal

719
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,159
with that's actually

720
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,360
part of it general controls um

721
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,279
and what some people don't understand

722
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,799
because i actually had a

723
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,640
kind of annoying conversation with with

724
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,919
someone once where they asked me

725
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,760
they actually kind of challenged me out

726
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,679
do i did i understand what controls were

727
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,320
i said

728
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
sure i do i worked with these policies

729
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
and procedures and you know i

730
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,279
you know i got a really negative

731
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,520
response from this person because this

732
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,360
guy this person did not understand that

733
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,720
yes

734
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
policing proceeded are in fact controls

735
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,000
this person thought that

736
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
they're only only technical controls or

737
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,400
controls and that's just not true

738
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
um you know they start off as policies

739
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
and procedures

740
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
you hopefully they are then implemented

741
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
in technology

742
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,919
so for instance if you have you know

743
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,679
password settings you first have a

744
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,320
password

745
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
policy that sets down that hey

746
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,400
you know our password must be

747
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,559
minimum-based characters you know

748
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,720
make sure upper and lower case you know

749
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
you need to change it every

750
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,240
you know 90 days all that sort of jive

751
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,679
you define that in a

752
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,799
password policy that is a control

753
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,240
that's an it's what an administrative

754
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,159
control and then hopefully you because

755
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,840
you have that now administrative control

756
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
you then take that and you implement it

757
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,279
into technology

758
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,919
into your password system that way when

759
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,880
you go to

760
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,679
you know create a new password that you

761
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,120
pick something that's in line with

762
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,559
policy because the technology is

763
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,640
enforcing it you know

764
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,520
but yes policies are controls ideally we

765
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,880
want technical controllers to put in

766
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,919
place but

767
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,200
that's how it works um

768
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,320
again that's what i'm talking about here

769
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,400
about password policy

770
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,440
um we also talked about you know you

771
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,240
know for for

772
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
it to control framers there's actually

773
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
two main ones there's

774
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,840
cobit from isakka and the other one is

775
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,320
from koso they're internal control

776
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
framework and this is what sock 2 is

777
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,960
based upon

778
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,559
there are other control frames for

779
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,919
information security we talk about

780
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,200
control frameworks

781
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,559
is things such as 27002 and

782
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
uh nist sp 853

783
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
and the cis control which used to be

784
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,760
called the critical security controls

785
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,159
and the stuff within the nest cyberspeed

786
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:42,799
framework

787
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,679
those are all security controls these

788
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,320
are things that

789
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,799
hopefully everyone has some working

790
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,158
familia familiarity with

791
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,080
i wanted to touch a little bit on coso

792
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,200
only because again if you're getting a

793
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,400
sock to

794
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,640
you you'll hear it you'll hear it on

795
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
occasion in fact one of my um

796
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,240
when i was working with one of my

797
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
clients the uh the assessor kept saying

798
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
you know you know coso standards and he

799
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,400
kept mentioning koso and the guy you

800
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,080
know the cio who i was working with

801
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
you know returning he's like what the

802
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
heck is he talking about with koso

803
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,520
he had no idea what it was because he

804
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
was a technical person and i had to like

805
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,080
say

806
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,799
that's just where the controls come from

807
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,240
so coso

808
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,880
is it stands for committee of the

809
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
sponsoring organizations of the treadway

810
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,760
commission

811
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,960
it was actually when they had um uh

812
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,720
the enron uh scandal with accounting and

813
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,080
whatnot this

814
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,679
a group of five um organizations that i

815
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,320
listed here things like aicpa and other

816
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,880
as you can see kind of accounting and

817
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,480
professional organizations and i.t

818
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,360
audit and whatnot came together you know

819
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,320
as a committee

820
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,279
and they uh set down some standards on

821
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,200
internet control risk management and so

822
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,840
forth

823
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,400
to hopefully prevent in the future you

824
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,039
know accounting fraud and so forth

825
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,360
um you know you might see these two

826
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
things floating around

827
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,520
referred to as the coso cube of how they

828
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,559
kind of put these things into there they

829
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,360
have what they have with

830
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,200
all an enterprise risk management

831
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
framework and internal controls

832
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,760
framework

833
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,000
that was you know put out i have not

834
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
seen these documents

835
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,279
um i've kind of thought about getting it

836
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,320
just for the heck of getting it and

837
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
looking at it but

838
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
you know all the sort of stuff even with

839
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,679
the sock two stuff is like

840
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,600
really really really dry reading and um

841
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,799
kind of boring but that's where it comes

842
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,080
from and that's about as much as i'm

843
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,360
going to talk about when it comes to

844
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,159
koso

845
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,360
you can go to the website and you can

846
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
bore yourself to death if you want to go

847
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:41,760
and

848
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,679
take a look at it but having said that

849
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,080
as i said the you know the trust

850
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,360
security criteria

851
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,080
of sock 2 is based upon these what they

852
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,600
call kosovo principles

853
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
there's 17 of them organized into these

854
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,640
different groups

855
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,919
and this is kind of like the high level

856
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,760
grouping of the controls

857
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
and some of the stuff at the top you

858
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,279
know like control environment

859
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
and communication information and risk

860
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
assessment these are more of the

861
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,760
upper management type stuff where in

862
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,120
some cases i don't even necessarily have

863
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,960
a good visibility because

864
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
you know i'm more you know the infosec

865
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
i.t level

866
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,760
you know and i'm not i don't know what

867
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,520
the heck's going on and like say

868
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
you know the senior leadership team and

869
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
the board and this sort of stuff

870
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,039
uh it's down in these other ones here

871
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
where we get into logical and physical

872
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,200
assets

873
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
access controls and system operations

874
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,440
and change management

875
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
this is more where it gets into the more

876
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
it's type stuff

877
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,039
that i'm used to i'm sure most of you

878
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,399
guys use are used to

879
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,000
this gets into like hey are you doing

880
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,240
backups you know you have antivirus in

881
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,960
place

882
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,399
know you have um are you managing

883
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,120
account creation and deletion and you

884
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,799
know

885
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,640
doing pin tests and you know

886
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
assessing controls and patching systems

887
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
and all that sort of stuff

888
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
that's more in the in these lower areas

889
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,080
and whatnot that

890
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,159
you know the sock 2 gets into that i

891
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
think for most of us we would be

892
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,159
you know but the thing is that people

893
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,120
don't realize is that

894
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,039
also gets into the upper things until

895
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,720
like that what what the management team

896
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,159
is doing are they

897
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,000
you know taking a look at you know

898
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,520
what's going on in the organization and

899
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
setting down standards and

900
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
you know what what we refer to as the

901
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,039
tone from the top

902
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,080
yeah that they're set

903
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,559
then

904
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,559
okay i also wanted to touch upon us

905
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,840
versus international

906
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
the thing is that these stock reports

907
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,760
are are pretty much

908
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,440
american and american focus and they

909
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
have little or no value

910
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
outside the u.s um and then something

911
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
i've actually seen with some clients

912
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,320
where

913
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,559
um you know some will go for a sock 2

914
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,720
report and some will go for

915
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,240
certification iso 27001 which is

916
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
probably kind of the closest for an

917
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,600
international

918
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,559
you know comparison um some might do

919
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,120
both

920
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,399
but um you know so if you're if you're

921
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,840
working here in the if your company is

922
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,279
here in the u.s and you

923
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,360
only deal with you know companies in the

924
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
u.s then a sock 2 is probably more

925
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,559
valuable

926
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,159
you know uh than an iso 27001

927
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,520
whereas if you're more of an

928
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
international company doing business

929
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,480
overseas

930
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
then you know 27 0001 maybe more value

931
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,240
and you know sometimes people get both

932
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,559
you know so i've seen that as well

933
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,720
um you know it's just this depends

934
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
and there's actually is a lot of overlap

935
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,000
between the two i think even um

936
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
aicpa actually has some crosswalks

937
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,360
between

938
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,279
sock2 and other frameworks including

939
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,640
27001

940
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,039
so if you're really curious you can you

941
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,200
can go check it out

942
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,440
so what is actually in a sock 2 report

943
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
and i've actually seen several and i

944
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,919
i wanted to show you guys one to you

945
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,080
guys but unfortunately i said

946
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,279
because the fact that you had to kind of

947
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,600
sign off on an nda and whatnot and

948
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,720
figured this would probably be a

949
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,120
reported recorded session i

950
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,399
didn't want to risk anything so um this

951
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,080
is kind of a high level overview kind of

952
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,559
what

953
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,320
you will see so there'll be like a

954
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,000
letter from the assessor company they'll

955
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,559
be a letter from the company itself

956
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,159
uh honestly these are kind of like

957
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,399
boilerplate sections i i kind of skip

958
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,519
over them

959
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,799
i want to get you know as i'm if i'm

960
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,159
looking to report myself i want to get

961
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,200
into the meat of it

962
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,399
so the next part is the system

963
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
description which believe it or not this

964
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,840
is actually written by

965
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,799
the company itself and then this you

966
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,120
know

967
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
it gets the format of the assessor so

968
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
with one of my clients i was actually

969
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
the one that actually wrote the system

970
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,200
description

971
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
um so the system description talks about

972
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
the company

973
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,559
you know itself what services it

974
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,080
provides and of course

975
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,880
you know again it's it's what's this

976
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
report is on and i'll talk a little more

977
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
what i mean by that shortly

978
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
you know what third parties they rely

979
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,279
upon because that's something we

980
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,399
you know you might not think about it

981
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,640
but you know many companies

982
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,360
you know maybe a providing a services to

983
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,080
a

984
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,960
to a client that they themselves rely

985
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,360
upon

986
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
other third parties for their you know

987
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,559
for what they're doing so

988
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,640
if you think about it like if you know

989
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
if i'm you know

990
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
a sas vendor selling my sas you know

991
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,240
software service services to declines

992
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,360
you know

993
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,960
my system might not be in my you know

994
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,840
back back office that may be at a data

995
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,320
center

996
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
or in the cloud well that's a third

997
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,440
party

998
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,039
that i'm relying upon for the servers

999
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,519
that i'm providing to my clients and so

1000
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,440
you know i need to go their sock to

1001
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
reports and

1002
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
take a look at it and show that i've

1003
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,159
done so and that's part of it

1004
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,519
uh then it goes into the control

1005
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,279
assessment

1006
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,559
you know on all the controls that

1007
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,399
they're assessed against you know what

1008
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,320
was the outcome did were they tested or

1009
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,519
not tested

1010
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,760
you know and that's not a negative thing

1011
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,640
there are

1012
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,399
there are in some cases where that you

1013
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,760
they actually

1014
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,640
couldn't can't test something um and let

1015
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
me explain let me give you a couple of

1016
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,440
you know actual examples um i mentioned

1017
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
one of the clients i worked with was a

1018
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,240
very small company

1019
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,960
uh they were about 15 people and one of

1020
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,600
the things that they

1021
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,240
that you they test they get tested on is

1022
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,120
you know

1023
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,399
how you handle your onboarding of

1024
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
employees and your off-board of

1025
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,000
employees

1026
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
so this can be like 15 people and they

1027
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
have not had anyone

1028
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,519
come on board or leave during that

1029
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,120
assessment period

1030
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,320
so since no one has come on board and no

1031
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,919
one has left

1032
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,919
how then could you test your processes

1033
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:44,640
for

1034
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
bringing someone on board or having them

1035
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,399
leave you can't because there's nothing

1036
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,279
to test

1037
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,440
so it's not so it's not a negative you

1038
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,519
you actually can't test it

1039
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,080
um or even like you know if you have a

1040
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,600
process that you

1041
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,399
do for handling of a security incident

1042
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,000
and you haven't had a security incident

1043
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,440
you can't really test per se

1044
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
you know that you know you can do like a

1045
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,399
table top exits but that's not quite the

1046
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,760
same thing

1047
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,359
um there's also of course the outcome of

1048
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,960
the test which is of course you know

1049
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,760
that there was

1050
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,560
it was all good and it was you know no

1051
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,839
exceptions found that's actually what

1052
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,520
usually what they say if that's if it

1053
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,440
went well or

1054
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,960
if there was a problem then they found

1055
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,879
exceptions which you don't really want

1056
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,918
because that's not

1057
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,679
good um and so if that's the case

1058
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,359
then this last section is what you what

1059
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,040
you will see where

1060
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
management of that company then has to

1061
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,159
respond

1062
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,839
to why they failed these these

1063
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,800
these tests and actually one one stock 2

1064
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,679
report i saw

1065
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
i was rereading recently that was the

1066
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,879
case

1067
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,679
um uh i'm not gonna do give you too much

1068
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,119
details but think basically what it was

1069
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,839
was

1070
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,079
due to the pandemic they decide to like

1071
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,400
be a little more looser with some of

1072
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,839
their controls

1073
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,160
so then they got kind of like spanked in

1074
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,599
the report because of that and then they

1075
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,960
had to kind of like say

1076
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,680
you know well you know we we loosen the

1077
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,040
controls through the pandemic

1078
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,720
and that was a mistake we won't do it

1079
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,160
again type thing

1080
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,200
so you you know as a company you want to

1081
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
have a report that comes out with

1082
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,560
no exceptions that's what you want

1083
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,240
and thankfully the two companies i work

1084
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,839
with no exceptions

1085
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,240
so one one big part that talk to you for

1086
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,400
is part of vendor management

1087
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,880
um you know if you're a company and you

1088
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,480
want to assess the vendors that

1089
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
rely upon to run your business like i

1090
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,920
said

1091
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
you know and a lot of companies you know

1092
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
that's just the way it is now is they

1093
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,160
rely upon

1094
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
third parties to be able to do what they

1095
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,359
do

1096
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
you know i said a lot of companies are

1097
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
you know they put their

1098
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,920
computers either in the cloud or in

1099
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,240
data centers from third parties they

1100
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,839
want to make sure those are managed

1101
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,920
uh they may be relying upon you know

1102
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,119
like adp and other

1103
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,320
other companies to provide them with

1104
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,160
like accounting and payroll

1105
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,000
services and this sort of stuff so they

1106
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,599
want to make sure hey that's all

1107
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,880
copacetic um so because of that you know

1108
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,520
you

1109
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,599
how do you then you should do due

1110
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,680
diligence and and be assessing

1111
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
these different vendors and you know if

1112
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
you're especially if you're providing

1113
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,359
them

1114
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,760
your data you want to make sure that

1115
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,200
data is secure

1116
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,520
and not gotten out and now in you know

1117
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,720
the healthcare industry we

1118
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,000
call this a business associate and

1119
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,079
that's very very critical but outside

1120
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,440
that you want to be able you want to be

1121
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,119
managing those vendors and know that

1122
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,560
they're doing written right

1123
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,520
so how do you do it you know and either

1124
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,880
this you can make it

1125
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
a lot of work for yourselves or you can

1126
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
try to make things easier you know

1127
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
one you can do like sending them to a

1128
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,920
questionnaire that they then have to

1129
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,960
answer to say like

1130
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,280
you know do you have policies are you

1131
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,000
doing

1132
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you know do you have you know you have

1133
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,599
antivirus in place are you doing do you

1134
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,040
have a disaster recovery plan in place

1135
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,079
have you tested it

1136
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,520
have you have instant response blah blah

1137
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,119
blah blah blah blah

1138
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,960
because i see a company called shared

1139
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,599
assessments that actually will sell you

1140
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,839
a very good questionnaire for that very

1141
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,800
purpose

1142
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
uh to make it easier

1143
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,800
or you can save yourself a lot of grief

1144
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,839
by saying

1145
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,040
hey you know either fill out this

1146
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,079
really tiresome questionnaire or

1147
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,000
give us your sock 2 report or

1148
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,720
some summer reports like that you know

1149
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,359
and then we'll kind of go away

1150
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,520
so i said you know doing your own air

1151
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,800
even if you're doing like soft you know

1152
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,839
even if you're doing like a shared

1153
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,040
assessment site thing

1154
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,280
you still have to look over it you know

1155
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,240
asking for that

1156
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
third-party important just makes things

1157
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,880
a lot easier um of course the caveat is

1158
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,640
you do have to freaking look over it

1159
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,400
like i said i saw a one sock 2 report

1160
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,520
that i think

1161
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,720
was over 200 pages you know and there's

1162
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
a lot of details and you got to kind of

1163
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,680
go through that

1164
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
um you know but having that you know

1165
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:02,960
kind of

1166
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,400
makes it easier in terms of vendor

1167
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
management but the thing is

1168
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,800
is that there's a new new stock 2 report

1169
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,480
every year so you need to

1170
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
be on top of it as for the new one and

1171
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,079
so forth um

1172
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,680
and so because of all this vendor this

1173
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,000
is what is actually what's driving you

1174
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,720
know

1175
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
the need for these companies to say like

1176
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,359
hey you know we're working with you

1177
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,520
um either give us a sock to reporter

1178
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,440
we're not gonna do business with you

1179
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,800
the money we're being at least gonna be

1180
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
reasonable they're like saying like okay

1181
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
we know it's gonna take you some time

1182
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
and effort so

1183
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
we'll get we'll give you two years to

1184
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,000
get get the sock to report

1185
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,280
uh otherwise we're gonna stop doing

1186
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,040
business with you yeah so

1187
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
so the next thing is is that you know

1188
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
that's what you're being faced your

1189
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,400
company is

1190
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
is being told they have to get a sock

1191
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,079
two report and

1192
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,839
you know you may or may not like you

1193
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,599
know get pulled into it

1194
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,320
you know um again why are you why are

1195
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,119
they pursuing it

1196
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,440
ideally it's become is done because

1197
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,359
their clients are asking for it and

1198
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,560
because i've actually dealt with all

1199
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
these questionnaires i see that a lot i

1200
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
see like you know we want a sock 2 type

1201
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,760
2 report

1202
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,960
you know or we want you know 27 000 one

1203
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,000
certification or

1204
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,720
two or three others and so forth um it's

1205
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,160
important of course that you have that

1206
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
executive report of support

1207
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
because this is gonna take time and

1208
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,720
money you know if

1209
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,119
you know i know that certainly you know

1210
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,440
if i'm focused on getting stock too for

1211
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,680
from for the company i'm working for i'm

1212
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,119
gonna be spending a lot of my time my

1213
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,160
time is money

1214
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,119
i'm gonna have to be going through a lot

1215
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,640
of other people and say okay i need your

1216
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
help on this and

1217
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,040
you know we need to fix this and this

1218
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,200
sort of stuff um hopefully man

1219
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,079
understands that

1220
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,240
how much time is to take it's not like

1221
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
you're going to knock this out in

1222
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,880
a weekend or a couple of weeks and

1223
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,920
this is going to be an ongoing cost this

1224
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,160
means that someone will need to be

1225
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,079
gathering evidence all year long

1226
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,960
in preparation for an annual assessment

1227
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,440
and the

1228
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,200
authors are going to come back you know

1229
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,640
every year and

1230
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,839
spend you know

1231
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,640
several days you know gathering evidence

1232
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,560
talking to people on this sort of stuff

1233
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,240
you know and again that's going to be

1234
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
not only you're paying them

1235
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,920
that you have money to do that you know

1236
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,280
you have to deal with

1237
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,400
someone running around gathering all

1238
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,760
that information and talking with them

1239
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,440
and so on and so forth

1240
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,000
um so people need to understand that

1241
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,040
that's that's how it is

1242
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,920
um so set things up for success i said

1243
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,520
what is your time frame

1244
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
you know give yourself at least two

1245
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,359
years as a worst case

1246
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,480
it can be less um like i said

1247
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
the smaller client i was working with um

1248
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,079
i would i would say that

1249
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,240
it took you know for us it was you know

1250
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
to go and get them

1251
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,839
from nothing to get them the sock to

1252
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,319
type ii was basically a year and a half

1253
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,240
you know i came in helped them out

1254
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,280
we did the sock two type one um

1255
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,720
in like august of 2019

1256
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
with the target of them coming back in

1257
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,240
you know

1258
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,079
again to do the type 2 uh with a august

1259
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,240
2020 of course that meant that they were

1260
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,359
actually here a little bit

1261
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,640
earlier to kind of do the evidence

1262
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,800
gathering and so forth so

1263
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,440
start to finish about a year and a half

1264
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,000
you know

1265
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
so that's that's how it is uh again you

1266
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,839
have to get that management backing

1267
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:22,640
hopefully

1268
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
they're the ones driving it but like i

1269
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,319
said you need it for for time and money

1270
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,720
um what is the scope the assessment this

1271
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,240
is something also important to think

1272
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,640
about

1273
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,839
is you know are you doing your entire

1274
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,040
company

1275
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,599
or just a subset because this will

1276
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,000
affect your costs and your effort

1277
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,319
um like i said the two examples that i

1278
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,119
worked with

1279
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,119
in one case it was the entire company

1280
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,839
because the entire company was doing

1281
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,200
you know the incentive programs so

1282
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,880
everyone was involved in that that was

1283
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
that was the service they were they were

1284
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
selling so it had to be the whole

1285
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,680
company but just

1286
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,720
that's how it is with the retail

1287
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,200
entity that i was working with instead

1288
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,720
what they did was they

1289
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,800
they instead of being the entire company

1290
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,240
which was

1291
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
been a nightmare thank god they didn't

1292
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,440
do it because i probably would have gone

1293
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,240
insane

1294
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,800
they actually shrunk the scope very

1295
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,880
small to just being

1296
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,839
the two entities that were providing a

1297
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,760
software as a service service

1298
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,079
and that was it they left all the rest

1299
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,319
of the entity out

1300
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,920
that in my mind made it much more

1301
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,920
doable also reduce their cost very much

1302
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,599
so that's something also and you know

1303
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,200
that's something someone had to be

1304
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,000
thought about

1305
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,760
if you have like maybe an international

1306
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,640
company you know and maybe the stock 2

1307
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
report is only on

1308
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,920
your u.s business and not the stuff

1309
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,680
overseas that could be done or

1310
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,920
you know if it's just you know you're

1311
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,200
you know you have a large interview and

1312
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,640
all kind of different things but

1313
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,520
you know your services to clients that's

1314
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,119
it's more appropriate for sock too maybe

1315
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,480
just a small subset

1316
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,599
great just do the sock to report on that

1317
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,079
um yeah so and even if you look at

1318
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,680
things like without with aws or maybe

1319
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,040
with microsoft

1320
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,640
they actually have multiple sock two

1321
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,720
reports because it's on

1322
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,880
each one on just as a small subset

1323
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,839
service because again

1324
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,920
microsoft is a huge company they're not

1325
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,359
doing a stock coupon on the entire

1326
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,200
microsoft company it's inside it's not

1327
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,319
just it's only on

1328
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,880
oh you know our azure services or our

1329
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,319
office 365 that's

1330
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,599
it because you got to think about it

1331
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,319
like microsoft is also like

1332
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,720
xbox and things like that so they're not

1333
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,839
going to include

1334
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,160
their xbox business into a sock 2 report

1335
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,599
that makes no sense

1336
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,200
so that makes it more more easily done

1337
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,400
another thing here what i talked about

1338
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,359
is like you know because they're having

1339
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,800
a consulting company coming to know

1340
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,440
assist

1341
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,880
you know the company i work with this is

1342
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,280
what we did for clients we came in

1343
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,880
and helped them out um you know

1344
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,640
we would do things like we would look at

1345
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,000
we would assess their readiness we'd

1346
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,960
look at like the

1347
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
what controls were in place you know

1348
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,319
what policies were in place

1349
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,880
what need to be improved help them do

1350
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,640
that because sometimes people in

1351
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,079
in the company were just maybe they were

1352
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,599
really other things or just hadn't had

1353
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,040
that knowledge of expertise

1354
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,720
and so having that outside expertise

1355
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,480
expertise coming in and

1356
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,119
helping them out you know could really

1357
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,240
assist them

1358
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,920
uh and even some other other clients we

1359
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,839
were helping with you know

1360
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,760
maybe we came in and just helped them

1361
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,599
with the information gathering

1362
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,599
for the assessment itself and some of

1363
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,119
the things that we did

1364
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,160
to kind of help them out

1365
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,960
i didn't determine scope i talked about

1366
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,480
that about the scope that's a very very

1367
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,200
important thing

1368
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,400
another thing i mentioned earlier is

1369
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
about those those five trust services

1370
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,400
do you do all five or just a subset um

1371
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,680
you know that also will help you with

1372
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,440
costs i mean i think personally

1373
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,680
in my view the id should be the minimum

1374
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,040
is doing the security

1375
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,680
availability confidentiality and if you

1376
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,079
can

1377
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,160
leave out processing integrity and

1378
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,280
privacy

1379
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,119
um but that can be determined by your

1380
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,560
clients so that's one thing that we

1381
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,240
that i had to do with my current company

1382
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,560
was take a look at some of these

1383
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,040
um questionnaires from our different

1384
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,319
clients to see like

1385
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,920
what did they say about the sock 2 in

1386
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
term like what controls that i had to

1387
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,960
include and i only saw a mention for a

1388
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,599
couple

1389
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,680
you know couple mentioned security you

1390
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,640
know one also

1391
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,200
mentioned confidentiality that was it

1392
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,680
you know

1393
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,720
so that works another thing is what i

1394
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,280
mentioned

1395
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
earlier is that do you go for the type

1396
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
one report this year

1397
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,359
and then work your way up to doing the

1398
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,000
type 2 that could be good if you

1399
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,560
are uncomfortable that you actually have

1400
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,040
a year's worth of evidence already in

1401
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,680
place

1402
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,119
because you don't want to be going and

1403
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,280
jumping in to do a type 2 report

1404
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
and find out that up you're missing

1405
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,040
evidence and now you're going to have

1406
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,720
failures you know in that report um

1407
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
or do you feel that you do have that

1408
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,599
year's worth of evidence that you can

1409
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,440
jump in and do the type two

1410
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,960
like i said with the two two companies i

1411
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,880
worked with one did the type two

1412
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,800
immediately i was a little bit scared

1413
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
about that but it was successful

1414
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,400
the other one we did the type one and

1415
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,000
then the type two

1416
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
you know that's i was kind of told

1417
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
that's not the normal thing to do

1418
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,839
um you know and that that worked as well

1419
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,640
preparing for the assessment like i said

1420
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,319
you want to assess those controls

1421
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,240
what i typically did was i got a i had a

1422
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,599
spreadsheet that i had

1423
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,520
obtained you can get these look them on

1424
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,920
the internet actually aicpa has them

1425
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,960
that basically listed

1426
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,000
all of their the it the controls

1427
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,119
and then i went through and said okay do

1428
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,119
we have documentation for these

1429
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,200
you know let me actually write down the

1430
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,560
policies that exist

1431
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,200
or if we don't uh i need to go make sure

1432
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,040
that we have that in place

1433
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
is there evidence in place you know and

1434
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,319
if so do we have

1435
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,880
a year's worth of it um i should have

1436
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,599
added this here

1437
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,839
as well is what i would also recommend

1438
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,880
doing is

1439
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,280
going and noting who should be kind of

1440
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,520
the subject matter expert for that

1441
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,839
controller what not because when the

1442
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,040
assessors come in

1443
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,319
those are the people that you're going

1444
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,240
to probably have interviewed on

1445
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,160
for that so i went through and said okay

1446
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
these are more hr type stuff

1447
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,079
so it's going to become the hr people

1448
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,680
and i actually was able to get

1449
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,440
you know the right people's names and

1450
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,720
put them there and like

1451
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,920
oh he used the more i.t control so hmm

1452
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,040
you know like these one here i think

1453
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,359
it'd be this this this guy here who is

1454
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,200
doing this area so that he'll take care

1455
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,280
of that and these controls that's that's

1456
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,800
gonna be this other person here

1457
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,559
um so as i really kind of identify who

1458
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,240
the person i would go to

1459
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,680
to kind of like validate that we have

1460
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,040
evidence who would be the ones that be

1461
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,520
enter

1462
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,640
interviewed so i mentioned about

1463
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,680
evidence so these

1464
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,720
you know unfortunately i'm not seeing

1465
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,319
like a listing that says like okay for

1466
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,119
this control

1467
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,920
they want to see these things um i

1468
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,720
really wish i

1469
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,760
you know that i don't know if that

1470
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,319
exists or if it's just not available so

1471
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,839
what are they looking for when they talk

1472
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,920
about evidence

1473
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,880
obviously they're going to look for

1474
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,119
written policies and procedures

1475
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,559
that's that's a given um other evidence

1476
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,920
would be like reports like if you're

1477
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,680
doing a pin test report

1478
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,480
vulnerability scan report if you conduct

1479
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,040
a

1480
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,520
disaster recovery or incident response

1481
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,400
tabletop exercise

1482
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,920
they should have a report generated from

1483
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,960
that that said this was the results

1484
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,880
any output from any systems like you

1485
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,000
know log files

1486
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
virus scanners backup systems and so

1487
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,440
forth that show

1488
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,280
that these things are going you know

1489
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,040
happening you know

1490
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,160
and doing properly um it could also be

1491
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,440
things such as if you're doing a

1492
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,599
training you know you want to have it

1493
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,559
you know

1494
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,960
in an actual system that evidence of you

1495
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,800
know pay people did training or

1496
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
you got people signed off on you know

1497
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,359
uh contracts and you know employees sign

1498
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,960
off on nda's you should have somewhat of

1499
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,760
a system

1500
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,640
that that's all kept in because you use

1501
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,920
that to provide evidence

1502
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,839
um you know configuration settings like

1503
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,839
say like i think the password settings

1504
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,680
and stuff like that if there's any

1505
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,000
screenshots being provided as

1506
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,760
as evidence you need to include

1507
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,800
you know a date and time stamp um

1508
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,160
i think it's not just because sometimes

1509
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,000
you don't think about it other evidence

1510
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,599
says we're saying like org charts

1511
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,920
job descriptions and so forth uh

1512
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
sometimes evidence can be kind of weak

1513
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,200
and you want to make sure about that i

1514
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,839
mean

1515
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,440
you know i'm sorry you know someone

1516
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,040
taking notes in a notepad

1517
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,160
application saving it is weak evidence

1518
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,879
you want evidence that can be

1519
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,200
not not questioned for being valid you

1520
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,559
mean you don't want something that some

1521
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,160
some you know idi just kind of wrote up

1522
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,000
that oh yeah you know i did this

1523
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,200
you know on this stage this at this

1524
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,640
state that i have no way to validate in

1525
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,280
that

1526
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,920
yeah did you create that six months ago

1527
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,559
or did you

1528
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,000
create that today yeah something else

1529
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,599
they do is they also will sample

1530
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,880
evidence um that's important because

1531
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,319
you know if you're giving a year's worth

1532
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,559
of evidence that can be just too much

1533
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,480
um you know just as an example you know

1534
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,119
if you do security awareness training

1535
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,640
for all the employees

1536
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,960
they're not gonna say okay you know you

1537
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,880
have a hundred employees

1538
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,680
please give me the record for every one

1539
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,200
of these employees for the effort for

1540
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,359
them going through through training no

1541
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,480
they're not going to do that

1542
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,680
they're going to do a sampling they're

1543
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,599
going to say give us a list of your

1544
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,800
employees

1545
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,480
okay and they'll go through that list

1546
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,680
and they'll put it they'll pick out a

1547
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,640
random sample

1548
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,040
set you know maybe 10 or 15 and they'll

1549
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,240
they'll come back and say like

1550
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,760
okay these 10 15 people

1551
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,280
give us evidence that they have gone

1552
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,040
through training that they assigned

1553
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,680
their

1554
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,839
you know nba agreement they've signed

1555
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:36,960
that they have uh

1556
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,359
will abide by company policies and so on

1557
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:40,400
and so forth

1558
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,400
you know and then you need to provide

1559
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,000
that evidence and that way

1560
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,280
you know it's not like you're giving

1561
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,040
them a hundred

1562
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,119
copies of things but you're given you

1563
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,400
know you're giving a sample

1564
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
that they have selected from that's a

1565
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
random sampling um so that's something

1566
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:54,960
that they do

1567
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,400
that they will do a lot um

1568
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,040
so it's it's it's a lot it's a lot of

1569
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,559
stuff and that's why also i said

1570
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,240
you know if you've got some in the

1571
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,760
person who has been gathered so this

1572
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,160
stuff over to over a period of time then

1573
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,720
it comes

1574
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,960
because much more easier when that when

1575
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,480
the assessors come in and start asking

1576
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,520
for you to give them stuff

1577
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,640
uh the assessment i said you know that's

1578
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,640
when the assessors

1579
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,920
you know from the accounting firm come

1580
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,480
in and start doing their work

1581
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,319
uh they of course be asking for evidence

1582
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,760
they will you know have some kind of a

1583
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,680
system to make it easy uh

1584
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,640
you know an ftp site or what have you to

1585
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,160
upload all the evidence

1586
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,440
they'll be very clear about what they're

1587
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,359
looking for

1588
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,280
they will set up interviews for key

1589
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,400
personnel

1590
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,599
you know executives management hrit

1591
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,400
people and so forth and a lot of it is

1592
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,920
they're kind of validating what

1593
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,200
you know what's going on if that you

1594
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,920
know if the policy says xyz

1595
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,800
the other person said okay you know tell

1596
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,920
me how you do your job

1597
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,720
you know because they looked at the

1598
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,960
policy they want to make sure that

1599
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,760
what they're being told is you know what

1600
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,040
what is matching up and

1601
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,319
they'll even go further we'll actually

1602
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,000
have the person do things and whatnot

1603
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,640
and say like

1604
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,240
okay hold on let me take a we'll do

1605
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,599
screenshots and this sort of stuff

1606
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,359
as i said the the system description

1607
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,119
that i talked about that

1608
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,240
you put together this is usually the

1609
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,680
first year that's done

1610
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,079
that has also provided i said one of the

1611
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,599
clients i i was one that wrote the

1612
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,720
system description

1613
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,079
that i spent a lot of time understanding

1614
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,000
the company and so forth

1615
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,640
then i took a template that the the

1616
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,599
assessors had and i modified that

1617
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,839
with what i knew of the company and you

1618
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:36,960
know we did a little bit big one

1619
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,720
there was some back and forth between

1620
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,240
myself the assessor some other people in

1621
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,960
the company

1622
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,599
to kind of hammer that out but that's

1623
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,880
how it came from

1624
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,160
now the thing is with with the

1625
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,000
assessments is that up until

1626
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,599
kovid all the interviews were on site in

1627
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,040
person interviews

1628
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,119
and would typically run you know

1629
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,480
depending on the size organization two

1630
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,839
or three days

1631
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,680
maybe more at least the ones that i've

1632
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,800
dealt with because the size of the

1633
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,680
company

1634
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,520
um i would think probably two or three

1635
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,760
days but for work a really big company

1636
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
i have no idea what how many how long

1637
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,680
the interviews would take

1638
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,520
now with as i had my my two clients i

1639
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,000
worked with were

1640
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,160
last year and due to covet everything

1641
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,359
was remote

1642
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,920
you know we did this over like a two or

1643
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,359
three year period

1644
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,520
you know doing the interview spread out

1645
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
over that two or three year period

1646
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,559
um it's our two three week period

1647
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,800
um so that's a little bit different i

1648
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,920
know that's something that um

1649
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,800
aicpa is kind of allowed for because in

1650
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,559
the past they wanted they expected the

1651
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,480
assessment to be on site and that's

1652
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,599
something i also think about when you

1653
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,119
talk about cost is that

1654
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,119
you know if you use like a local company

1655
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,400
to do your assessment

1656
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,079
you know then you don't have to worry

1657
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,760
about travel costs versus

1658
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,599
you know oh here we are in miami and i'm

1659
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,359
going to bring in a company from

1660
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,480
from dc to do my assessment uh oh great

1661
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,680
i'm going to have to

1662
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,920
you know put them up in a hotel and yada

1663
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,839
yada that's going to come out of

1664
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,040
what what you're being charged for the

1665
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,280
assessment versus oh yeah there's some

1666
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,640
local people and they just they just

1667
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,440
come on over

1668
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,040
and for the day and whatnot so

1669
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,000
um now after the assessment you know the

1670
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,280
assessors of course will take all the

1671
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,480
evidence they'll go through and

1672
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,680
they'll review it um they will someone's

1673
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,599
come back and say like okay i need some

1674
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
more evidence here or this isn't clear

1675
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,040
and this was that there might be a

1676
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,240
little bit back and forth on the

1677
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,440
evidence

1678
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,640
um they will then draft up and this

1679
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,359
until the draft report will take usually

1680
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,880
a couple of weeks or so

1681
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,359
they'll draft up yeah at least at least

1682
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,559
this is what i dealt with there was a

1683
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,599
couple of weeks i think again for the

1684
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,040
bigger companies

1685
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,640
you know it might be longer than that

1686
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,599
they will draft up a draft sock 2 report

1687
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,280
it'll get sent to key personnel for a

1688
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,200
review like i know i got it as

1689
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,000
i was one reviewing the draft report you

1690
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
know i was looking for

1691
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,799
not just the basic stuff but just making

1692
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,400
sure that this was

1693
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,720
it was accurate it looked good um i

1694
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,559
think with one of the reports they

1695
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,599
they there were a couple things where

1696
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,359
they had dinked us on stuff and i went

1697
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,799
and kind of

1698
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,760
went back and said i don't know if

1699
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,119
that's correct you think that's on this

1700
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,559
i don't know that's true and

1701
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,040
we did some back and forth and we we

1702
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,799
worked it out and it was um

1703
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,559
you know it went when it went okay um

1704
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,119
and you know so i think if there is

1705
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,720
issues around the evidence

1706
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,319
you know then of course you can respond

1707
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,480
to it and if you

1708
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,520
if they can't address it then

1709
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,559
unfortunately you're gonna have to kind

1710
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,480
of write up a report that kind of

1711
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,079
that's much more serious to say like you

1712
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,240
know you know yes we did we didn't do as

1713
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:30,720
well

1714
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,480
this is why we're not gonna do it again

1715
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,079
so on and so forth

1716
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,160
so overall this whole process might take

1717
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,520
two or three weeks

1718
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,839
um that's why if you want the report and

1719
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,119
say in august

1720
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,799
they're going to come in like a month or

1721
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,000
two before to start the evidence

1722
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,520
gathering the interviews and

1723
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,040
developing report and this sort of stuff

1724
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
because you know once august hits

1725
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,200
boom that's kind of the cutoff point

1726
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,960
they can't take any evidence after that

1727
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,680
anything that

1728
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,440
intake has to have been dated before

1729
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,119
that time um

1730
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,720
hence that's why they have to come in in

1731
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,480
advance of that to do the evidence

1732
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,839
gathering

1733
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,280
interviewing and this sort of stuff

1734
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,440
because they do have to be

1735
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,240
you know that cut off point and no

1736
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,640
further

1737
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,960
um so again you know and this is you

1738
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,000
know for me i had like

1739
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,839
basically the first time doing it so you

1740
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,119
know the first time is there's a lot

1741
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:17,599
more work

1742
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,520
you had to create that system you know

1743
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,040
that system description

1744
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,319
it's the first time being assessed for

1745
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,720
those controls and so forth so hopefully

1746
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,079
you know when the second year comes

1747
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,680
along and the third year comes along

1748
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,319
where

1749
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,559
you know if as long as there's no no

1750
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,319
radical changes in the organization and

1751
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,680
its environment

1752
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,280
it's just more of you know you gather

1753
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,200
the evidence you make sure it's in place

1754
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,640
they come by they take a look at the

1755
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,240
evidence everything looks good

1756
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,720
boom you're done you know we'll see you

1757
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,799
next year type thing and i hate to say

1758
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,640
it it'd be kind of routine but

1759
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,319
to agree it does but you still have to

1760
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,160
have that evidence and so forth

1761
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,480
uh otherwise you know there's gonna be

1762
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,119
some problems

1763
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,040
again once the report is complete you

1764
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,400
know if you if the company wanted to

1765
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,680
they can actually add a logo on the

1766
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,559
website saying that

1767
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,599
they have a sock 2 report you know hey

1768
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,000
do business with us we get stock 2. um

1769
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,359
they can then provide that of course

1770
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,359
with an nda to

1771
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,720
potential clients or actual clients

1772
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,839
as i said they have to appropriate they

1773
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,920
need to preparing for next year

1774
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,040
um hopefully if need be maybe improve

1775
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,160
controls

1776
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,319
maybe improve evidence if some of the

1777
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,760
evidence was kind of weak

1778
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,839
uh and but they accepted it but you know

1779
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,200
let's let's do better

1780
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,640
they get more strong um advanced getting

1781
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,240
is it can be a lot of work you know

1782
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,799
it may be you need to create a a whole

1783
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,480
bunch of directories and save stuff

1784
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,319
or there's actually these things called

1785
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,079
grc tools which

1786
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,440
you know makes it more automatic and

1787
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,680
there's people i know that

1788
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,240
their whole their whole job is basically

1789
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,520
pulling in stuff and putting in the

1790
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,880
chersey tool and making sure the

1791
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,720
evidence is gathered and so forth

1792
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,440
you know i don't know if i'd want to do

1793
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,799
that but that's what some people do

1794
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,640
um but that's what kind of helps making

1795
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,839
this as an ongoing activity

1796
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,280
there are source resources you know i

1797
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,480
would say the best one is just go to

1798
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,839
aicpa

1799
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:06,960
they do have a lot of things that you

1800
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,200
can download uh there is a there is a

1801
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,920
spreadsheet

1802
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,920
of the trust security controls you want

1803
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,280
to look at for the

1804
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,319
2017 version that was last update of it

1805
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,240
um you know i went and grabbed it

1806
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,079
another one you can get it's called dc

1807
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,760
200 which is the career for system

1808
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,680
description you know these are you know

1809
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,280
you can you can find these for free and

1810
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,240
whatnot

1811
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,880
um if you want to go further you can get

1812
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,400
the book

1813
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,799
which is the guidebook which i have a

1814
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,680
copy

1815
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,680
it's uh clocks in it uh oh 460 pages you

1816
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,119
know real fun reading

1817
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,680
um but this covers everything it has in

1818
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,640
it

1819
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,640
all the controls and they talk about it

1820
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,119
they have they include dc

1821
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,079
200 and all that sort of stuff um really

1822
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,040
boring stuff i

1823
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,040
i'd admit but you know if you want you

1824
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,480
know if this is

1825
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,520
if you why not happen to do uh a sock to

1826
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,200
assessment in your company or help them

1827
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,680
out

1828
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,040
you might want to get it and i'll be

1829
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,200
honest the best place to get this is on

1830
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,960
amazon

1831
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,680
aicpa has a website but i've actually

1832
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,559
looking at it

1833
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,160
it's actually cheaper and easier to get

1834
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,040
it off of amazon

1835
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,400
and if you're if you're really really

1836
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,760
curious is actually actually another

1837
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,079
book for the soc 2 for cyber security

1838
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,520
if you're curious about that i did do a

1839
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,520
presentation on that a few years back

1840
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,920
um but the funny thing was i actually

1841
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,319
talked to an assessor about this

1842
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,960
about a couple years ago and she told me

1843
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,720
that no one

1844
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,960
had at that point and not just her

1845
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,079
company but everywhere

1846

published by wiley came out in 2018.

1857
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,960
um it's uh it's a kind of a kind of a

1858
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,960
boring stuff but you know

1859
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,400
what i would say as a as a starting

1860
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,680
point you know you guys you can get the

1861
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,720
spreadsheet

1862
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,960
you know for free uh and let's look at

1863
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,000
the controls

1864
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,359
um it can be a little bit tricky so you

1865
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,960
might want to you know get the boat to

1866
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,240
kind of help you out if that's you're

1867
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,040
serious about it

1868
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,640
they also have some good like pdf

1869
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,160
documents that kind of explain

1870
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,720
stock 2 reports and some of the elements

1871
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,920
so you might want to get those because

1872
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,480
they're free

1873
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,079
as a starting point kind of look look

1874
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,920
through them and read them before you go

1875
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,599
and splurge on getting the book

1876
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,760
um it's not too expensive you know

1877
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,119
i want to think it was like 50 bucks or

1878
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,880
something like that but you know

1879
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,520
it's not too bad so

1880
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,799
yeah again the title is in the slide

1881
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,319

uh if anyone from that's watching on the

1895
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,920
discord as well

1896
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,079
if you want to type that question in on

1897
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,040
uh the general chat

1898
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,040
we're actually going to question

1899
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,640
streaming this into a discord which is

1900
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,200
pretty cool

1901
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,720
yeah but you have the echo because you

1902
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,400
have both streams

1903
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,960
sorry i'm not mute right now

1904
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,880
so you mentioned some of the grc tools

1905
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,119
there's still an echo i've been getting

1906
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,119
a lot of ads and my whole company has

1907
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,400
about stock in a day tools which

1908
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,760
isn't gonna happen but they are

1909
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,000
advertising as these

1910
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,599
like ten thousand dollar tools that are

1911
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,079
basically document storage yeah that's

1912
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:26,960
basically

1913
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,000
checklists integrated yeah have you seen

1914
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,480
those provide any value

1915
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,319
because it's something between

1916
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,160
the only value i would see in them is

1917
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,079
just helping helping you kind of

1918
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,680
organize

1919
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,200
the evidence gathering that you need to

1920
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,039
do because when i started thinking about

1921
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:45,760
it because

1922
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,799
you know a lot of stuff i i don't do

1923
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,359
i don't use tools just because we didn't

1924
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,280
have the money for tools

1925
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,799
yeah i would do a lot of spreadsheets

1926
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,160
and this sort of stuff and so something

1927
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,599
i'm thinking like okay if i'm

1928
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,680
you know gathering all this evidence you

1929
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,440
know what's the easiest way for me to

1930
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,240
kind of

1931
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,760
gather it and manage it and all i can

1932
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,280
think of is like creating a

1933
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,960
pardon my friend just shitload of

1934
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,319
directories

1935
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,000
because the way it is if you look at you

1936
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,559
know at you know the sock 2 controls is

1937
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:15,440
that they're

1938
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,880
you know just it's a spread you know

1939
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,799
just listening so you have

1940
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,839
you know 1.1

1941
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,799
and then underneath it there is four or

1942
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:25,280
five

1943
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,839
possible controls so

1944
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,839
1.1.1

1945
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,559
this sort of stuff so i do have a whole

1946
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,640
bunch of nested directories

1947
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,160
or what have you and then as i'm getting

1948
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,000
evidence i go like okay

1949
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,440
i got this evidence for this month i'm

1950
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,799
dropping in there oh i've got this money

1951
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:45,599
for

1952
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,520
evidence from from the next month i drop

1953
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,880
it in there and then i go in there and i

1954
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,760
got like

1955
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,119
a year's worth of evidence either

1956
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,799
gathered

1957
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,640
either weekly or monthly and it's all in

1958
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,920
a freaking directory

1959
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,200
you know all these sub directories it's

1960
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,359
like oh my god and you know how do i get

1961
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,079
it into

1962
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,520
over to the assessor and it's sort of

1963
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,839
like so a lot of the grc tools that's

1964
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,680
what they're all about is that

1965
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,559
they're helping you kind of manage these

1966
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,920
these sort of uh

1967
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,599
uh these sort of things like there's

1968
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,440
like service now

1969
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,880

1972
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,280
you know it's and it's they're not just

1973
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,039
for sock too they're for

1974
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,760
like all these sort of auditing and

1975
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,599
assessments and so forth that that

1976
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,280
are out there that you know

1977
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,440

1978
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,640
and pci and and everything else

1979
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,480
you know that just becomes you know even

1980
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,760
some of these tools where actually you

1981
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,880
actually will

1982
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,200
put your actually your whole policy set

1983
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,839
in them and so forth

1984
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:53,039
so you know it's it's really kind of

1985
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,640
crazy so

1986
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,920
you know it's a whole business i mean

1987
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,280
when you go to like an eye soccer

1988
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,720
conference

1989
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,119
and there'll be like probably two or

1990
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,480
three vendors

1991
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,839
you know just on grc tools

1992
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,880
yeah you know rsa has one ibm has one

1993
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,559
and yadda yadda yeah i'm seeing this new

1994
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,559
class come out that they're not

1995
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,480
full-blown grc tools and i say that

1996
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,400
because it's not very customizable

1997
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,319
it's we've got sock in one other

1998
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,599
framework and they're separate

1999
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,440
pieces of software that we sell as sas

2000
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,039
applications

2001
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,359
yeah i get the value if you have three

2002
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,799
compliance things and you need that same

2003
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,160
piece of evidence to be tagged in

2004
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,520
different ways

2005
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,000
but i just didn't know if you had seen

2006
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,880
somebody actually

2007
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,799
find value out of one that's

2008
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,039
specifically for sock two

2009
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,280
and not a full-blown grc tool

2010
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,640
not really that's something i i i'd love

2011
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,200
to uh

2012
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,480
learn more about because you know

2013
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,160
as i go forward and doing more and more

2014
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,160
compliance stuff with companies

2015
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,280
you know i want to see like what what

2016
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,520
tool would i want to use

2017
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,280
it's even funny even like you know the

2018
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,359
accounting firm that i was working with

2019
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,119
you know initially for for their system

2020
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,640
for even uploading and giving them

2021
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,520
evidence

2022
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,160
it used to be basically an ftp server

2023
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,000
which was a real pain

2024
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,839
and they went to another system and i'm

2025
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,839
like i hate to say i'm blanking on the

2026
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,039
name of it

2027
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,280
but it was it was um it was like a

2028
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,039
more like an excel spreadsheet on

2029
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,400
steroids

2030
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,240
in that you had an excel spreadsheet

2031
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,680
they had all the controls

2032
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,200
but then there was an area for oh i can

2033
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,799
just drop in the evidence for

2034
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,599
that you need and it was uploaded to

2035
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:32,559
them and then i know and then

2036
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,079
then they could mark it to show like

2037
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,440
okay we got the evidence everything is

2038
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,240
good

2039
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,000
you know who they're going to talk to

2040
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,839
and this one so it was a great way for

2041
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:40,799
us that

2042
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,640
you know to track the progress what need

2043
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,960
to be done what was there and so forth

2044
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,000
and i'm blanking on the name

2045
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,200
of the product um

2046
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,720
yeah i want to say share file but that's

2047
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,480
not correct

2048
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,440
but it was it was you know it you know

2049
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,720
when they went to do

2050
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,319
to use that with with their assessment

2051
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,559
it just made things a lot easier

2052
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,240
especially able to just do drag and drop

2053
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,959
and so forth

2054
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,720
you know with the assessments

2055
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,559
it was another question about free

2056
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,400
materials to do um about the it audits

2057
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:20,799
or

2058
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,480
at least to get started what would you

2059
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,000
recommend to get started

2060
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,039
um i've actually kind of had a hug learn

2061
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,559
on my own but

2062
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,680
uh i kind of looked up to isaka

2063
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,319
for i t audit type information um

2064
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,720
because i kind of view isaka as the uh

2065
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,760
i t audit and control organization um

2066
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,160
another one is iia

2067
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,359
the internal audit association that i'm

2068
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,640
not really involved in but i'm involved

2069
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:46,880
in

2070
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,119
with isakka so they have materials and

2071
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,720
whatnot some of them it's only

2072
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,480
you know either you have to pay for it

2073
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,920
unless you're a member and then and if

2074
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,559
you're a member

2075
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:55,920
you know you either get it free or there

2076
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,760
are some training and i think they've

2077
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,280
done some i think recently done some

2078
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,240
training

2079
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,280
um some certification programs

2080
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,119
um on it audit that's um

2081
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,920
fairly inexpensive so that's something

2082
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,240
to look at

2083
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,280
you know they've even done some other

2084
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,359
things that are kind of interesting um

2085
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,080
yeah they have one that they have one

2086
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,439
certificate called uh

2087
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,040
a cyber security audit certificate um

2088
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,600
that's something to look into uh they do

2089
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,799
have training i think even

2090
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,080
you can get like a book from them that

2091
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,120
you can they can just read through and

2092
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,560
get prepared for it

2093
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,759
and they also wasn't thinking with isaka

2094
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,080
as they recently teamed up with the

2095
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,080
cloud security alliance

2096
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,120
to come up with a cloud security

2097
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,319
audit knowledge certificate

2098
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,359
which is the first so and that's

2099
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,560
something that's also kind of you know

2100
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:50,960
that's

2101
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,319
it's also kind of uh you know

2102
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,080
bothered me because as more and more the

2103
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,759
companies i've dealt with were moving

2104
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,158
the cloud am i thinking like okay

2105
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,839
how would i audit that and

2106
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,679
um you know understand that what they're

2107
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,960
doing is okay and now

2108
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,759
now they've got this

2109
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:21,839
