and he was very eager

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
worked very hard

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,159

discord we also have a slack but we're

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
shifting to discord for

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,878
for most of the other hacker spaces to

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,680
have everybody with each other

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,160
this presentation would be

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
published

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
in our in hackmiami youtube channel and

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,680
uh the slides will be

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280

we haven't yet

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,519
announced it but it's likely to be

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
a in-person meeting we're also trying to

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
do an impression meeting on the west

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,879
coast as well

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,400
that would involve uh

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
activities such as uh lock picking

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
hacking drones hacking bluetooth and

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,519
then finally see if we can see each

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680

um so

89
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,440
a little bit introduction about myself

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
um

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,200
i i was uh

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
i was in the navy for five years uh then

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
after that i decided to go get a

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
bachelor's in chemistry and biology

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
then after that

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
i decided to uh go to dental school

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,200
so

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,879
um let me let me change this one second

99
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,239
let me turn off my camera

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,920
so it's not in the way

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
do i

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,519
turn it off

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,239
one second

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
all right so it's not in the way in the

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,519
screen

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,480
so

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
um a little bit more about myself so

108
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
then i uh

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
i was a teacher that's where i i left

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
off i was a teacher in high school for

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,639
about four years

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
since i'm a veteran i decided to go back

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
to school

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
i met rod at miami-dade college and then

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
i'm here

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
working

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
towards my career in cyber security so

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
so this is something that

119
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
i don't see it as a job i see it more as

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
a profession so i think is

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
is something that is important to see it

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
as because

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
once you see it as a as a profession

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
then it's easier for you to spend all

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
the time studying and doing all of this

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
okay so let's start introduction to

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,000
cloud fan testing i am sharing this

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
documentation um with this communication

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
that we share is a form of pdf

130
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,639
um i'm using obsidian here

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,840
obsidian

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
is a great tool not only for um

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,400
or to write the write-ups but also as uh

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,960
to take notes as a penetration tester as

135
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
a cyber security analyst as a sock knock

136
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
etc as any professional in the industry

137
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,919
or anything else

138
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,440
so these are the majors uh cloud pen

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
cloud

140
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
providers that we have of course google

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,240
aws

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,039
azure link node and digitalocean um in

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,840
this presentation i'm going to try to

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,160
demonstrate a phishing attack against

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
office 365

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
okay

147
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
um

148
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
and maybe

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,199
um if i can set up a ws i can try to

150
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,080
just simulate uh copy a bucket

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
through the cli where we could

152
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
um see that it may not have enough

153
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,840
permissions

154
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,720
from

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
that user specifically

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
so

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
so it's um so it's one of those not

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,199
attacked but it's funny configurations

159
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,479
okay so type of clouds that as a as a

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,319
security analyst outside penetration

161
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,600
tester um you could you need to be aware

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
of a software as a service platform as a

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,120
service and infrastructure as a service

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
the reason why i say that is because

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,280
this is what is important what you

166
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
manage so what you manage is

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
what is actually

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,360
um

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
you're gonna be

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
attacking or

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
allowed by the company that you know

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,600
that you're gonna be uh pen testing uh

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,639
against

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
against it so infrastructure of the

175
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,520
servers search the most leeway then

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
follow that it will be platform at the

177
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
service because

178
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
you still manage a little bit

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
but the majority of it is the provider

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
is managing and then you have software

181
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
as a service you usually you just

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
probably just forging

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
authentication um

184
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,160
of office 365 because the majority is

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
going to be managed by the provider by

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,280
google

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
et cetera

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
google aws

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,479
any other provider this is the

190
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,960
methodology that i came up with

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
um this is got it from mitra attack of

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
course this look at my tray is

193
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,319
really huge so

194
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
i i came up with this i i put some of

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
the tools um below it so you guys could

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,360
take a link uh click on it remediation i

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
put the cis

198
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
which is a great information that you

199
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
guys could use

200
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,080
i will show you how it's laid up one of

201
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
the downloads that i acquired from from

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
the cis

203
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
so basically the recon area is

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,879
you want to try and find sub domains so

205
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,160
you want to try to go ahead and find

206
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
some domains use your best tool here the

207
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,919
one that you want

208
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,240
and then you want to do your scanning so

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,479
you wanna if you find

210
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,560
i don't know uh login that my my my uh

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
my domain is pesacitoinc

212
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
dot com so if i you find

213
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,919
login.citoinc.com

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,400
then you can try to find the ip address

215
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,479
and using map or

216
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,039
mask all right

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,720
and then we have the vulnerability we

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
can use classboy brawlers and aws tool

219
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
then the exploitation phases and then

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
you have pulses rotation and persistence

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
this is where it actually gets tricky

222
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,240
for me i'm not an expert and i'm not

223
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,519
going to sit here and tell you that i'm

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,800
100 expert in cloud uh pen testing but

225
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,560
i'm still need to draw on i still need

226
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
to troubleshoot in this

227
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,200
uh persistence okay because what i've

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
seen from doing cloud

229
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
it's um it's more of a cloud security

230
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,080
assessment and where you where you do

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,880
the

232
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
the architecture

233
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,279
um you paint you paint you don't paint

234
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
that's the architecture but you um you

235
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,880
may do the measurements of the security

236
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,399
that they have

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,200
so thanks to avoid detection is that

238
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
torque bridges

239
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
and then bypass guard duty to clients

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,560
okay

241
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
so dns recon what it does um it's right

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
here it helps find subdomains and then

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
you have mass scan which help finds open

244
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
ports and those sub domains as well so

245
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
mascara i think is designed to

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
run through the internet really quickly

247
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
and fast okay

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,279
so

249
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,519
what's in scope okay so i put a link

250
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
here to aws pen test inside so basically

251
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
the easy to instance and that uh gateway

252
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
so likes to load balancer rds cloud form

253
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
aurora

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
and then azure

255
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
rules of engagement

256
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,040
so if you click on aws pen testing um

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
let me go here

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
it's going to show you exactly what the

259
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
customer service policy for penetration

260
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
testing so before you do anything you

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
want to make sure that your client

262
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
understands

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,760
that this is what you are

264
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,040
um

265
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,959
what is in scope okay so what is in

266
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,640
scope and what is not in scope is

267
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
critical because sometimes you may have

268
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
a client that tells you oh no

269
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
uh i wanted you to test this but then

270
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,959
you're like wait a minute um the outside

271
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,959
is scoped so we didn't do that we need

272
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
to make sure that everything was written

273
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
down

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
a small comparison between

275
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
aws

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,839
and azure is for example is the ec2

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,560
instances are asian virtual machines

278
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,120
so this is just

279
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,440
it's not

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,279
that's what that's the name and the

281
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,720
nomenclature that it uses so bible proud

282
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
virtual private cloud is virtual network

283
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,240
rds sql data issue that doesn't mean

284
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
that they are the same okay doesn't mean

285
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
that they're the same but

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
it is some similarity in the servers

287
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
that they provide

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
okay

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,640
now scrolling down

290
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
this is important here to understand

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
what the microsoft office on-prem active

292
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,519
directory what it uses and then the

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
microsoft azure active directory uses

294
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
all right so as communication protocol

295
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,839
you use ldap

296
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,360
microsoft azure users https

297
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,880
authentication protocol and tlm version

298
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,839
2 are microscopes if you're on-prem

299
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,839
make sure that at least they're using

300
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
kerberos ntlm version 2

301
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
it's susceptible to men in the middle

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,360
attack is susceptible to be used with

303
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
responder tools and other

304
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,360
tools out there to capture this uh hash

305
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
and then microsoft azure active

306
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,959
directory you have opened up the

307
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
authorization i think

308
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
oauth

309
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
and then samuel i don't remember the

310
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,560
exact

311
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
and then global structure about domain

312
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,880
force tenant and subscriptions this was

313
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,920
interesting for me to understand because

314
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,320
um the idea of subscriptions you have to

315
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
have every user in a subscription kind

316
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
of thing and when you're using uh aws

317
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
cli

318
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,680
i mean as your cli you need to have a

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,079
subscription base on that user is to be

320
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,120
subscribed to uh to something

321
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
attack matrices

322
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,920
i found this link here

323
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
on attract major securities stacking

324
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
mappings i put it there

325
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,279
that's one and then i also

326
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,360
i found this office 365 i asked uh from

327
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
lina lo

328
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
lao um

329
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
she developed this um

330
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
this matrix of attacks so reconnaissance

331
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
initial access discovery actions

332
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
and persistence again

333
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
so

334
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
um

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
we are going to try to what i'm going to

336
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,040
try to show you is after we're going to

337
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
fish a user

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,600
uh

339
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,959
the username is orca

340
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,880
and um

341
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,959
and then we're gonna have

342
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
we're gonna try to have initial access

343
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,079
we're gonna

344
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,959
capture the the password if it's allowed

345
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
if it has multi-factor identification we

346
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,800
might just use the token

347
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
for that and then we're going to

348
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
enumerate through the email and then the

349
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,680
actions that we might see we might copy

350
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
a um

351
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
a disk from azure and then

352
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,399
see if we can extract any hashtag from

353
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,120
it

354
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
okay

355
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,959
all right so tool to practice in the

356
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,680
cloud these are the tools that i look

357
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,279
into it

358
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,439
you have i use this one for

359
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,120
okay hold on a second

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
i use ada's asher active directory

361
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
hunting live bachelor cloud gold

362
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,120
we might use this in um

363
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
uh today uh since it's uh it's really

364
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
good let me show it to you

365
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,639
basically what it is is

366
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,399
you have different attacks that you can

367
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,360
create

368
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,320
and it's very easy to deploy

369
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,959
once you create these attacks you can

370
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
you can start um

371
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,839
attacking it now i have seen and i have

372
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
seen my first blend testing

373
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
my first

374
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,920
it was in aws

375
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,880
um it actually was a

376
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,920
they had a leaky s3 bucket and i was

377
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
able to get the ws access key and the

378
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,279
secret key and basically game over from

379
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
there

380
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
so sometimes you have an easy win

381
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,440
sometimes you don't you know

382
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
all right so

383
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,160
um let's set up

384
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,519
um fishing for office 365 i'm gonna move

385
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
this out over here let's go back to

386
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
to cali so

387
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,399
this is i'm i'll be using

388
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,360
kali

389
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,920
as my main uh

390
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
virtual machine

391
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,399
and then

392
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,920
uh from here

393
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,079
i have two things i have goldfish and

394
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,440
pesticide ink now so i can

395
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
put the

396
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
let me back up track here okay so if you

397
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
go to

398
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
person situ

399
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,279
i had 305 before but i changed it to

400
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
ink.com

401
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,360
all right this is specialty doing all

402
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
right

403
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
now it's not secure i didn't use

404
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
starbucks for this because this is just

405
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,360
the purpose of this

406
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,160
but if you go to i think the server is

407
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,720
down but if you go you change the i

408
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
i learned this from on a course that i

409
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,160
took that's from the cyber mentor the

410
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,199
fishing course it was really good um you

411
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
change the i for the l

412
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
and then

413
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
it's gonna die because my surface is not

414
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
on so is very similar to it and

415
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,440
especially in email it's going to be

416
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
very similar to it so anything that has

417
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,759
ink you can fish it you know you can

418
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
always take out an eye and make it

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
versus

420
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
you know something like that you have to

421
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
play with the domains okay that's

422
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
something that you you have to do and be

423
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,759
creative

424
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,240
in that sense

425
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
okay so

426
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,120
let me go to

427
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,680
let's see here

428
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
i'm gonna go to digital ocean and show

429
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,880
you

430
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,990
um

431
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,110
[Music]

432
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,199
let me show you with my browser because

433
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
not in cali is not there

434
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
let me show you here

435
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,319
okay so i have

436
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,240
i have goldfish set up

437
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,640
i have pesacito inc and of course this

438
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
is the original company right this is

439
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
their company that i'm attacking in

440
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,000
order for you to do this you're going to

441
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
have to have permission of course and

442
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,559
it's better it's thundering

443
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,559
and it's better that um

444
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,039
that the company itself buys the domain

445
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
so you don't own you know

446
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,320
uh

447
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,280
a a a domain that is not yours so if

448
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
they buy you tell them go ahead buy this

449
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,280
and then this is what we're going to use

450
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
for our fishing campaign and they're

451
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
like oh okay that's fine or

452
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
you know whatever

453
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,039
you guys decide and make

454
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
making

455
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,080
in

456
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
an agreement with all right so here

457
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,640
what i've all i did it was i copied this

458
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,440
copy the ip address so i went back

459
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,720
uh to um to the

460
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,880
to one of the tabs to one of the

461
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
and then i just root it i just uh log in

462
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
association we should show you that it's

463
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,520
easy so file new tab

464
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
let me just rename this

465
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,640
let's name it goldfish

466
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,880
i don't know nervous units

467
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,559
um

468
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,520
so roots

469
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
ssh roots

470
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
and make sure that that's the right

471
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,719
go fish copy this

472
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
yes

473
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,799
password

474
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,559
okay so i'm in so i'm in goldfish i'm

475
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,840
clearing

476
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,918
to

477
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,440
let's open up our server

478
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,480
it's this one so copy that

479
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,799
and

480
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,600
this one is very easy to use i i found

481
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
it very easy to use this uh digital

482
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
ocean it's very easy and it's very cheap

483
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,480
too

484
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
um i racked up my bill and azure to like

485
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,760
50 something dollars so

486
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
yeah playing open up you know spinning

487
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
out spinning down machines and things

488
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,480
like that

489
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,600
so

490
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,120
just be careful

491
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,640
with it

492
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
let me association to that machine

493
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
not that expressive for for you to

494
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
always have be roots

495
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
because if someone were to help you to

496
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,559
hack you then

497
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,080
you're root in that machine

498
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,120
but any case let me what's the password

499
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
here

500
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,400
okay so as we have that

501
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
so

502
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,799
once we have this let's start goldfish

503
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,440
so i think is

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
let's do

505
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
suno

506
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
goldfish

507
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
okay

508
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
so it will give you

509
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
it will tell you the port that you will

510
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
have to open up

511
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
so just copy that

512
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,960
it's basically port 3333 so let's just

513
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,440
come back here

514
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,240
to local holes

515
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,200

516
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,158

517
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,120

copy the ip here

525
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,679
so we should have it here

526
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,760
this is https and the ip

527
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,520
and then 33 33

528
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,919
okay advance

529
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,600
set risk

530
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
there you go we see goldfish

531
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,918
sign in perfect

532
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,640
okay

533
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,000
so from here um now let's set up the

534
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,039
other

535
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,360
now we have goldfish running

536
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,240
now here let me see what i have here

537
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,440
okay we have goldfish too but

538
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,200
this one i didn't use it

539
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
um

540
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,760
here what i can do is activate

541
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,720
iron gen x which is i forgot to mention

542
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,559
that's the tool we're using using evil

543
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,559
nginx

544
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
okay so we're using this i already had

545
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
tested it before so

546
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,039
i i was able to get the

547
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,880
it was an active session still so if you

548
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,520
click if you type sessions

549
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,280
it will tell you this is actually the

550
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,720
password i think this is the same

551
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
password but it tells you that this is

552
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
the date that it was acquired on okay so

553
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,120
it was the 24th which was yesterday

554
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,080
um when i acquired this is the remote ip

555
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
so let's see if this works right now it

556
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,200
works now

557
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,360
and then we are actually going to set up

558
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,158
a um

559
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,640
because i left it without multi-factor

560
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
identification for the purpose

561
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
and then i'm going to set it up with

562
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
multi-factor identification

563
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,400
so let's set up the campaign

564
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,559
so campaign

565
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,159

566
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,960
create an email template so basically

567
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,080

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,520
let's go to our office

633
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,158
sign in

634
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,080
let's go to use another account

635
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,320
let me use my browser here because

636
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,120
the kali is

637
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,559
um let's do this but

638
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,600
this is not the one that i want

639
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,399
oh yeah i did orca okay

640
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,360
so let's go to the outlook

641
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
now this user hasn't set up multi-factor

642
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,039
intensification but for the purpose now

643
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,799
for one of the purpose i'm just gonna

644
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,559
skip this for now

645
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,440
okay

646
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,960
now i think i send um

647
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
okay so this is the problem that i was

648
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,960
facing as you notice it sell a microsoft

649
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,799
um

650
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,360
outlook is putting them in junk mail

651
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,480
okay and i was facing this uh someone

652
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
can help me eventually to

653
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,960
to um take it out of the junk mail and

654
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
put it in the inbox is difficult

655
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,919
so to set up maybe i didn't set up the

656
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,840
post fix right

657
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,960
um and that could be a problem

658
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,679
but eventually this is the email now i i

659
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,760
forgot to do something i didn't put the

660
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,960
link okay so let me do it again

661
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
it's gonna be quick

662
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,159
now first before we do anything so i

663
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,279
need to make sure i get the link from uh

664
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,960
that i'm gonna use

665
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
so

666
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
and from the initial steps you have to

667
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,760
do config

668
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,159
domain and then the domain that you're

669
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,559
that you are using okay

670
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,559
so for this one is pesacito

671
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,360
l nci.com

672
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
all right and then you need to put the

673
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,159
ip address so config let me clear so

674
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,559
it's on the top

675
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,880
so we just put the domain now we put the

676
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,440
ip address so config ip

677
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,399
right and then

678
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,520
let me get the

679
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,520
yeah you should teach your ocean

680
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,799
okay

681
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,480
paste that there

682
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
okay

683
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,799
and then you do fishlets

684
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,039
host name is going to be office so it's

685
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,080
an o

686
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,880
365

687
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,480
and then the domain

688
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,679
which is let's say

689
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,639
okay

690
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960

692
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,760
we did config config ip fish late

693
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,080
i think i should have to enable it

694
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
because i already have it

695
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,440

696
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
fish let's

697
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,279
enable

698
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
and 365

699
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
places you need to set house number

700
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,919
first five fish is awesome okay

701
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,880

702
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,600
last name

703
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,480
um old 365.

704
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,679
um

705
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,640
why are you

706
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,600
recording

707
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,519
oh

708
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,880
let's take the name

709
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,120
okay

710
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,000
now you have to

711
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,320
enable it like it says it's disabled

712
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,918
here so you have to enable it

713
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,080
again there you go with my spelling

714
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,080
sorry guys

715
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,880
there you go so

716
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,039
um it's gonna look for login so

717
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,000
basically what happens here is that um

718
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,640
it successfully set up sells uh tls

719
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,360
certificate so when you go back the

720
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
tricky part here is that when you go

721
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,600
back to your domain

722
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,679
uh let's see here i did it in its

723
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,919
networking domains

724
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,159
uh

725
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,679
you have to have it as an a record okay

726
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,679
it may take some time to do it but i

727
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
have difference here but login is

728
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,080
important that you have it and your www

729
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,600
it's important that you have it like

730
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,200
it's asking you here to have it okay

731
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,880
now what we do is we say lures

732
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,519
url

733
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,480
i think this is you know lures create

734
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
o365

735
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,279
or 365.

736
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,320
okay so now you do lures

737
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,520
get url

738
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,879
and then the id here which is one

739
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,239
okay

740
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,879
so just copy this

741
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,239
and this is what we're going to send to

742
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,839
our victim okay

743
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,960
i'll put the link address

744
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,199
um

745
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,679
from here

746
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,240
delete this campaign

747
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,399
campaigns

748
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,000
and delete this and get confused

749
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,239
new campaign

750
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
you can get confusing

751
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,480
okay

752
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,560

785
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,920
a regular user you don't see anything

786
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,880
different

787
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,200

797
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,119
for now i'm gonna i'm gonna skip it many

798
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,359
people may skip it many people don't but

799
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,359
i'm going to show you both let's set up

800
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,800
multifactor

801
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,920
after this

802
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,880
so let's get that

803
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,040
and nothing everything here is normal so

804
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,839
where

805
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,320
what did evil genics do for us well if

806
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
you look here this is the password that

807
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,839
i type and that's the username

808
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,280
okay

809
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,359
so it captured it was a man in the

810
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,119
middle attack where he captured the

811
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,880
password that i put

812
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,560
um on with as well as the username

813
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,440
okay

814
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,400
so now we can say

815
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
sessions and you can see it will be a

816
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,560
new session right so this is the new

817
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,720
session that started here

818
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,520
okay

819
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
we can do this with facebook we can do

820
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,480
this with different uh fishless that

821
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,359
i think is fish

822
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,760
um there are many fishlets here you can

823
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
even create your own fishleg as well

824
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,480
okay so that's the first part the first

825
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,839
part is to fish it now let's

826
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,040

829
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,240
let's go here

830
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
forgot

831
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
let's do next instead of skip

832
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,560
we do next i'm going to set it up with

833
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,400
my iphone

834
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,800

836
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,240
set this up

837
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,720
set it up

838
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,720

839
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,040
okay

840
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,960
let's try it out

841
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,520
approve

842
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,160
okay

843
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,680
it should work

844
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,119
okay next

845
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,440
one

846
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,280
okay

847
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,160
so let's try to fish

848
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
i think pesticide already but let's try

849
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,560
to finish orca again let me sign out

850
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,240
so orca was smart enough this time and

851
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,200
she decided that you know these are

852
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,560
these were scams i guess

853
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
empty folder yes

854
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,078
okay let's do another one

855
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,119
let's see i don't know why it's not

856
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,079

898
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,520
now i have multi-factor identification

899
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,119
when i log in

900
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,440
but let's go back and see what evil

901
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,000
genix is doing

902
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000

color orca

905
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,480
i don't think i'll set it up right

906
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
you have to log out of uh of your

907
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,040
session to force it to refresh

908
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,240
oh

909
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,560
okay

910
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,920
in about 365.

911
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,839
oh of all 365 yes yes yes

912
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,400
i can use another browser

913
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,119
too so

914
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,640
let me do this

915
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,520
okay

916
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
yeah i should have used them right

917
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,440
let me screw a chrome instead

918
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,599
go to office

919
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,119
okay maybe i should face somebody else

920
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,280
oh

921
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,960
let's look at this

922
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,760
okay

923
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,439
to lower it all 365

924
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,559
okay

925
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,720
forgot to change the template

926
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,119
i'm going to change

927
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
okay

928
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,760
so we just got this email

929
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,440
click here

930
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,720
texas to sign in

931
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,839
sometimes it takes usually a little

932
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,200
longer than anything so

933
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,240
foreign

934
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,480
let's see what happens in

935
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,839
when i capture the password

936
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,119
that happened to me too when i tested

937
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,640
against a friend it kept capturing the

938
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,359
password not the whole token well the

939
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,119
point is that we have

940
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,079
one

941
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,520
yeah when you sign in the thing is when

942
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,599
you say stay signed in it cashes the

943
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,640
session

944
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,079
so

945
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,640
yeah logan don't tell us they sent in by

946
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,720
the way um when you when users do that

947
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,040
you can literally take the uh the

948
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,440
cookies by a mimikat but that's not what

949
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,920
we're talking today but yeah

950
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,599
okay that's a that was awesome

951
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,000
what did i just

952
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,240
just go ahead and

953
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,920
get back everywhere

954
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,359
including everywhere

955
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,040
that's it

956
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,440
i clear cookies browser history

957
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,760
okay

959
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,839
so let's see

960
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,400
you know what

961
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,559

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,040
yeah let me clear the

967
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,200
maybe if i clear the settings again

968
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,880
so here we put now right

969

973
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,720
session

974
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,640
just to make sure i'm going to copy the

975
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,200

00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,079
i'm gonna log out from here

978
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,759

979
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,599
okay

980
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,640
then i'm just going to paste the link

981
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,879
here

982
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,040
now let's see what you next do

983
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,640
ah don't tell me how to create a new

984
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,640
link

985
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
all it is is lures create

986
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,960
enable do 65.

987
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,319
oh no we collected it but this one was

988
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,079
the last session

989
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,119
not the one that

990
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,119
um

991
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,359
okay

992
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,319
okay there you go

993
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,839
i'm just going to base the url

994
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,359
in the

995
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,359
browser

996
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,839
so i don't mess with this sessions here

997
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,799
copy paste

998
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,440
it's hard to do a live

999
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,920
one through this

1000
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,559
let's see what's doing you in generics

1001
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,559
okay

1002
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,119
okay

1003
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,440
okay capture the it's not capturing the

1004
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,240
token i don't know why

1005
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,200
um but buddy you've got the

1006
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,400
the password

1007
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,440
from it

1008
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,280
um yeah i think it's i think it's the

1009
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,000
back end that the office 365 is not

1010
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,079
affected yet for the account for the

1011
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,440
double authentication that's why it's

1012
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,240
not catching it

1013
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,280
okay

1014
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,799
you have to be

1015
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,480
okay

1016
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,720
no problem

1017
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,520
no problem all right so

1018
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,200
imagine that we already captured the

1019
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,880
password

1020
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,720
and um

1021
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,880
and from here we can do many things if

1022
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,920
if if for example if we

1023
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
if we we can go through their emails

1024
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,000
right and that's one of the things that

1025
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
we will do so you should go through the

1026
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,839
emails here let's say that we log in as

1027
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,160
the as the person okay so it's not

1028
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,960
oh i already have the password

1029
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,119
so

1030
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,000
like i said click no that's right

1031
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,160
so here for example you know some people

1032
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,400
tend to send information through via

1033
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,000
email especially

1034
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,040
um

1035
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,920
passwords etc here we tend to have we

1036
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,240
have the access key and the secret key

1037
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,920
but we know better not to do that but

1038
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,240
sometimes people tend to be

1039
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,040
lazy and do it okay you want to use a

1040
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,720
secure

1041
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,799
ways of doing it

1042
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,319
i think there are services out there

1043
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,559
that allows you to send secure link

1044
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,319
between

1045
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,599
each person so we can do that

1046
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,839
so when it comes to

1047
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,599
this so we can try to log into aws

1048
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,920
from here

1049
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,119
so i already have

1050
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,240
um

1051
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,319
i think it's already

1052
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,440
things already configured but

1053
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,400
no that's not the access key so i need

1054
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,720
to copy this access key

1055
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,439
paste it here

1056
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,359
access secret key it's the one that you

1057
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,359
saw

1058
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,480
and then default region i'll leave it as

1059
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,680
uh us is one just click enter

1060
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,680
and then enter okay

1061
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,839
so that's aws so if you want to do

1062
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,839
anything in the edit or cli we can do

1063
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,400
um

1064
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,280
but we also can have the password so if

1065
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,960
they have aws

1066
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,400
they may have

1067
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,319
azure account as well

1068
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,920
okay so we can go to portal

1069
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
to login in azure

1070
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,880
um what we do is we say ac login

1071
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,079
this is another one that let me use

1072
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,960
another account

1073
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,880
i think or guys sign up

1074
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,200
in nashville i'm not sure if i set it up

1075
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,240
right

1076
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,839
if i set it up

1077
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,440
you kicked in now

1078
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,280
yeah

1079
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,720
like oh no subscriptions

1080
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,000
okay

1081
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,839
i know what it is

1082
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,200
because when i set it up originally

1083
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,640
i um i was about to send me an email

1084
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,839
uh from the

1085
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,040
admin um

1086
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,000
so what i was trying to do is i was

1087
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,490
trying to

1088
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,720
[Music]

1089
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,959
see here

1090
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,880
orca right i was trying to do also one

1091
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,240
from azure so from admin telling them to

1092
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,160
re-change their password and at the time

1093
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,119
my scenario was to get that password and

1094
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,200
get it but it was a different email so

1095
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,480
they were using a different uh

1096
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,520
uh

1097
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,000
email for that so for azure they were

1098
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,480
using

1099
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,319
jpd05 gmail.on microsoft.com

1100
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:39,558
so that was the reason why it's the same

1101
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,520
and close this

1102
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,839
okay

1103
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,319
so let me do it again

1104
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,400
so there's this one right here i'm

1105
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
supposed to send an email with this one

1106
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,839
as saying hey

1107
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,359
you know make sure you change your

1108
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,280
password in

1109
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,760
in asher

1110
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,839
okay i'm gonna i'm not gonna set it up

1111
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,599
you know guys

1112
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,039
so it should

1113
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,160
okay so we're in

1114
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,000
all right so basically this is the

1115
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,400
information so now i can use you know

1116
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,480
any commands that i want so for example

1117
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,720
uh since this is just basic we can list

1118
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,480
things so we can say you know ac

1119
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,520
um i think it's vm

1120
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,119
list

1121
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,119
it will give you a list of the vms that

1122
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,599
you are familiar but a better option

1123
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,000
will be for you to say for example let

1124
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,599
me clear it up so it's the top of the

1125
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:58,480
screen

1126
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,640
acvm

1127
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,000
list

1128
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,720
o output as table

1129
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,280
and uh it gives you here the different

1130
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,720
vms that we have right

1131
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,599
i could go incognito mode yeah that's

1132
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,400
true at least

1133
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:18,750
um

1134
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,359
[Music]

1135
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,760
then from here what we can do is there

1136
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,599
are different things um since we have

1137
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,960
we have access to the azure cli we might

1138
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,000
have access as well to the portal we can

1139
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,839
we can create a vm

1140
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,520
we can

1141
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,839
um we can create a disk

1142
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:42,880
um

1143
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,280
from it so we can say for example ac

1144
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,599
disk

1145
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,079
list

1146
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,680
list okay

1147
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,760
let me do a table

1148
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,440
instead

1149
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,839
you see this this

1150
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:58,960
output

1151
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,039
table is easier

1152
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,160
okay

1153
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,720
so these are the different this that you

1154
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,520
have and this is the maximum size so you

1155
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,480
can only copy as much as 127

1156
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,720
all right now this all depends on the

1157
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,599
right of of orca right because that's

1158
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,079
important so looking up

1159
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,440
um

1160
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,240
[Music]

1161
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,400
i think it's

1162
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,520
in aws it's aws let me see how you look

1163
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,000
at the profiles

1164
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,280
okay cool

1165
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,760
okay quickly

1166
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,480
so subscription id

1167
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,400
so this is the one i did the edit

1168
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,079
hunting lab

1169
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,880
okay so how do i look for permissions

1170
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:13,760
i want to know my

1171
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,359
my permissions is one of the first

1172
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,599
things you want to look into it

1173
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:18,480
so

1174
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,799
let's see i forgot the command for that

1175
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,920
so it would be usherer

1176
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,039
yeah

1177
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:26,319
permission

1178
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,319
users

1179
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,760
you see here

1180
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,559
okay so this is not

1181
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,480
we will have to

1182
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
um convert this into

1183
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,240
put it into a text file and then from

1184
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,079
there

1185
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,720
use grab or awk to do it but basically i

1186
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,559
can see that

1187
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,839
there are different members here juwari

1188
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:22,319
orca jamasta and dolphin

1189
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,520
this is not helpful

1190
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,240
but let's see if we can we saw those

1191
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,280
disks okay so since we saw this disk we

1192
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,359
can go ahead and see if we can create a

1193
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,359
vm from those disks

1194
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:39,760
so ac disk is a table

1195
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,680
so this one seems

1196
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,799
let me see

1197
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,680
workstation what is the workstation

1198
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,839
so most likely you guys

1199
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,400
let's just do this one right here

1200
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,720
so vac

1201
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,480
i need to get the

1202
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:13,119
behind the snapshot that we have

1203
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,719
name of the disk

1204
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,158
let's just do this one

1205
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
let's see if he does it like this

1206
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,359
worry i just want the id

1207
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,040
upload

1208
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,640
oh missing the resource group okay

1209
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,100
so i need to do

1210
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,520
[Music]

1211
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,080
ac

1212
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:05,920
first before this

1213
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,040
we're getting a step here

1214
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,519
if there's astro explorer then

1215
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,839
more

1216
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:30,880
to create

1217
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,000
the thing is we have to create a

1218
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,800
snapshot and the way that i that i

1219
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,600
wanted to do is use uh azure storage

1220
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,520
explorer because once we create a

1221
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,400
snapshot then we can use that

1222
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,960
to uh

1223
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,080
to

1224
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,000
to use the disk

1225
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,719
and the snapshot and then create a vm

1226
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,600
okay that's what that was my plan

1227
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,840
um

1228
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,320
but let me

1229
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,040
swear that i

1230
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,760
installed

1231
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,159
it oh

1232
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,080
oh you know what it is

1233
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,960
so why can't you not find it

1234
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,519
oh okay

1235
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,280
okay so it's asking me to do that let's

1236
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,320
see if he's there

1237
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,040
there you go

1238
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,000
so is the

1239
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,640
issue with microsoft one

1240
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,120
let's see if

1241
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,000
it's because of this

1242
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,799
no

1243
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,080
sorry about that guys it was supposed to

1244
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,719
it was working

1245
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,239
on okay

1246
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,600
that's all right you can you can move on

1247
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,480
to the next uh the next step

1248
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,440
okay

1249
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,000
yeah because the thing is i needed um

1250
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,800
my

1251
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,600
whole thing was that i wanted to

1252
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,840
the whole method behind the madness it

1253
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,960
was for me to create a snapshot using

1254
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,719
azure

1255
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:01,840
explorer

1256
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,080
and then from there

1257
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,560
i was going to um

1258
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,360
to create a disk and then with that disk

1259
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,800
you create a vm

1260
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,000
you know

1261
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,760
okay and then

1262
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,199
into it

1263
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,840
and from there we could use like you

1264
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,920
know mimi cats or something to dumps the

1265
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,840
hatches right now

1266
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,000
that's the methodology that i wanted to

1267
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,840
use but it's not

1268
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,760
um the disc you were going to take so

1269
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,320
basically what the methodology is find a

1270
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,400
disc from somebody else

1271
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,360
yes

1272
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,520
create the vm log in the vm dump the

1273
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,679
hashes and now move laterally is that

1274
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,120
what you wanted to do

1275
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,320
yes yes that's the that's that was what

1276
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,520
i wanted to do

1277
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,400
that's pretty cool okay that's fine and

1278
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,560
and then there's also ways where you can

1279
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,960
actually let's see we um you can run

1280
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,000
commands

1281
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,640
so you can do a run command

1282
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,080
invoke

1283
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,239
command

1284
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,120
id

1285
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,560
this is something i learned it's pretty

1286
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,960
cool you just you have to try it so

1287
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,440
we're going to run powershell

1288
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,919
script

1289
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,400
the name

1290
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,480
just give it a name uh let's do this

1291
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,600
then i need a group

1292
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,199
i need a group uh resource group

1293
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,600
you need you're gonna need a group here

1294
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,159
and then once you find the group let's

1295
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,640
see if i can find the group resources

1296
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,719
that i have here

1297
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,960
they see

1298
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,480
i should have wrote all the commands

1299
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,799
down actually

1300
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,600
so this might work

1301
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,120
okay

1302
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,159
so

1303
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,960
we have that

1304
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,159
so i see

1305
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,159
them

1306
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:25,379
[Music]

1307
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:31,939
[Music]

1308
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,760
then the script

1309
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,159
if allowed is something that you need to

1310
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,000
try you know never it never hurts you

1311
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,360
never know if

1312
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,120
you do a neck a

1313
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,880
exact basically we're going to add a

1314
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,719
user

1315
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,120
and the user is going to be

1316
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,880
um

1317
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,239
to master

1318
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,800
and then allow the password you must

1319
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,360
want to please creation and then add

1320
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,360
let's see

1321
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,440
command id the following arguments

1322
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,840
required command oh

1323
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,080
my english is not very good-looking

1324
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,360
nope

1325
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,600
it's not found

1326
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,199
not found the resource group

1327
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,040
let me check make sure i have the

1328
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,880
correct

1329
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,360
he's so screwed

1330
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,600
i think we can wrap um after this we can

1331
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,840
wrap it up because so if people have

1332
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,800
some questions for something um

1333
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,120
so i know it's getting a little late

1334
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,640
yeah that's fine

1335
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,520
i just mentioned the issue

1336
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,880
let me ask you this um

1337
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,600
user

1338
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,360
was that user going to be created in all

1339
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,920
vms

1340
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,679
this one

1341
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,760
yeah when you weren't adding the user

1342
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,600
where was that user going to be added to

1343
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,199
it's going to

1344
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,239
it's going to be created in

1345
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,560
yeah i think it will create that's a

1346
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,400
good question i didn't i didn't

1347
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,719
i didn't research most of it but it will

1348
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,360
create most of the all the vms i i

1349
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,480
believe so

1350
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,440
yeah

1351
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,760
okay so the vms approve

1352
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,199
by name right by name yeah

1353
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,159
okay

1354
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,360
oh wow

1355
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,320
that's dangerous okay

1356
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,120
yeah

1357
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,519
um

1358
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,480
we can um

1359
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,239
yeah

1360
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,400
yeah we can we can if anybody has

1361
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,760
questions uh we'll take questions now

1362
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,520
let's let's uh if you have questions

1363
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,600
that's better it makes me think to my

1364
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,480
process of what i what i did and what i

1365
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,640
was doing because i'm missing certain

1366
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,560
things because it's it's hard to do a

1367
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,640
live uh

1368
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,440
demos are always difficult it's yeah

1369
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,760
they're always difficult life is the

1370
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,360
most hard it's the hardest part it's all

1371
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,440
right you they're pretty good

1372
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,960
thanks man

1373
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,600
um so yeah does anybody have a question

1374
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,600
specifically how to set up the fishing

1375
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,159
environment i think i covered i took a

1376
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,000
long time doing that

1377
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,520
um

1378
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,840
and then i'm gonna what i'm gonna do is

1379
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,719
i set up all these commands

1380
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,840
nicely and me

1381
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,159
um i would i would share with you guys

1382
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,920
i'll put it in

1383
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,480
uh these are all the reference tool that

1384
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,600
i selected all the information from

1385
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,920
and this is what i was trying to do you

1386
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,880
see

1387
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,520
i i even created a list here of what all

1388
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,360
my steps that i needed to do because i

1389
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,000
know it's a live event so

1390
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
you what you want to do is you want to

1391
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,040
create a azure storage explorer which it

1392
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,000
was a pain getting it to work but i

1393
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,880
don't know why it wasn't working

1394
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,280
um

1395
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,159
and um

1396
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,840
maybe i should i use say both bms

1397
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,560
yeah okay even though that i did this

1398
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,639
you know i exported to the path that you

1399
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,679
have to install snap and after that you

1400
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:44,760
have to system oh maybe that's why

1401
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:05,719
let me do this

1402
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,840
i mean it gives people idea on different

1403
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,520
attacks

1404
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,639
um

1405
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,480
no it's not working okay

1406
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,920
i'm gonna move on

1407
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,800
so

1408
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
this is the internal recon i was

1409
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,120
planning to also use bloodhound

1410
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,400
um the azure home but it's too much i

1411
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,239
put too much into this

1412
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,639
um but basically this was the idea

1413
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,239
that's the use of storage explorer

1414
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:43,840
and you create a

1415
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
variable snap id which is this is the

1416
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,239
snap id you don't need to

1417
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,719
you can not create the verb or just

1418
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,840
create this command right here

1419
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,120
and then at the end here you just put

1420
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,800
the id

1421
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,239
that you get

1422
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,440
so

1423
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,840
you put the id

1424
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,920
and then you create a vm

1425
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,480
you name the disk that you're gonna act

1426
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,440
so this hack you attach it

1427
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,360
the admin user

1428
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,320
and then

1429
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,920
we just

1430
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,280
do the we use secret dump to um

1431
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,199
to find any of the hashes that we have

1432
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:26,000
inside there usually you know if it's a

1433
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,320
bigger disc uh

1434
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,920
if it's a domain controller or something

1435
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,760
like that or a workstation that you

1436
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,920
think you might have serving information

1437
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,400
etc

1438
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,120
and these are their reference here all

1439
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,360
of them are here

1440
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,519
so

1441
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,000
thank you for the invitation thank you

1442
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,520
that's it's been

1443
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,000
extensive i know uh

1444
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,440
i know that

1445
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,639
evil

1446
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,600
evil jinx is is a pain he has to set up

1447
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,000
uh he takes quite a time

1448
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,159
and sometimes it doesn't work

1449
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,760
um

1450
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,120
and uh uh

1451
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,639
great that you were able to set it up i

1452
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,639
didn't know about goldfish for example

1453
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,639
uh i seen tools like

1454
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,280
set said used to do you can do that with

1455
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,480
said too but

1456
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,239
i had to take a look at goldfish there's

1457
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,800
something new i learned today

1458
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,239
okay

1459
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,639
yeah it's it's actually really good we

1460
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,760
use it um and it's um

1461
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,760
and i don't know why i was not giving it

1462
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,000
back because it usually tells you that

1463
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,920
you know how many emails are open and

1464
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,400
how many are clicked it and you can

1465
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,400
record it and show it to the client

1466
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,400
eventually you know hey this is what

1467
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,280
happened

1468
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,840
and you can always take uh a snapshot of

1469
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,800
you know

1470
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,920
of the uh sessions

1471
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,600
in eurogenics

1472
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,960
so

1473
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,280
so if anybody has a question on how i

1474
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,560
set this up or something just tell me

1475
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,840
and i try to do my best

1476
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,679
i have a question that has more to do

1477
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:00,840
with like uh pen testing in general um

1478
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,800
so uh

1479
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,239
in your work

1480
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,639
do you also in your contracts have to

1481
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:07,840
specify

1482
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,239
um what kind of tooling you'll use um

1483
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,840
and that is i'm thinking about for

1484
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,120
example if a company um

1485
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,920
is has like a policy

1486
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,400
um against using certain open source

1487
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,600
software

1488
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,920
uh or certain um licenses um

1489
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,840
like i guess i'm wondering if that's a

1490
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,040
restriction that you have to keep in

1491
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,159
mind when you go into engagements

1492
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:35,920
that's a good question go ahead rob

1493
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,880
no i wasn't gonna say anything go ahead

1494
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,920
oh okay no i was gonna say that yeah i

1495
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,199
mean

1496
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,480
you wanna

1497
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,600
you wanna make sure that everything

1498
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,000
is is known by the

1499
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,760
uh the client

1500
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,480
and the client is states there okay if

1501
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,719
you don't want me to use your genix then

1502
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,719
stay you know because then i won't use

1503
01:24:58,719 --> 01:24:59,679
it but

1504
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,159
open sources of what i've seen

1505
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:05,120
everything is is on the table because a

1506
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,040
real attacker is not gonna it's not

1507
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,440
gonna discriminate between cobalt strike

1508
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,679
and metasploit if it's gonna use a

1509
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,320
metasploit um it would use it he's gonna

1510
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,600
use cobra strike it's gonna use

1511
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,440
cobblestrike it's gonna use

1512
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,280
just a brand new

1513
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,760
uh poc for a specific

1514
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,600
uh cbe that you know is gonna use it so

1515
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,760
i don't know maybe maybe there is it

1516
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,880
began with big corporations you know but

1517
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,120
so far i haven't seen it

1518
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,120
that it tells me no you cannot use this

1519
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,199
tool

1520
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,600
okay so follow-up question is basically

1521
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,760
there's so many tools out there right

1522
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,440
that you can use and we just showed a

1523
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,159
litany of cloud penetration testing

1524
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,920
um and in the azure space how do you um

1525
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,080
cool down like basically how do you

1526
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,520
select the ones that you think are

1527
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,440
relevant for a test as a beginner

1528
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:01,280
as a beginner um i mean

1529
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,239
okay so the the whole madness is that

1530
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:07,520
you you first have a scanning tool right

1531
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,679
and you tend to guide yourself sometimes

1532
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,080
by that at least as a junior penetration

1533
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,239
tester that i am you know

1534
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:14,680
um

1535
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,000
[Music]

1536
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,080
so i guide myself of that but when

1537
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,320
you're doing the cloud

1538
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,080
that usually the client will tell you

1539
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,800
okay here is a username and password

1540
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,520
user access or aws secret key or access

1541
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,719
key and you only have read-only

1542
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,080
uh

1543
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,120
access

1544
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,560
okay and then basically you try

1545
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,560
as either you try to fish them like we

1546
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,040
should try to do or basically you go

1547
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,080
from the inside and see their security

1548
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,199
posture

1549
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,400
you know

1550
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,920
but um

1551
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,679
that's that's that's that's what i've

1552
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,639
been doing so far

1553
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,360
i see that you said if nobody else has

1554
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,120
questions oh my god please like stop me

1555
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,800
because i i just like never stop asking

1556
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,600
questions okay

1557
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,080
okay so i see that you said like

1558
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,159
understanding the architecture the

1559
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,400
overall architecture of whatever system

1560
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,159
that you're testing is very important um

1561
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,679
i mean is

1562
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,800
do you have any tips for doing that i

1563
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,239
know that you are going to provide

1564
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,040
obviously the documentation um that you

1565
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,719
showed on screen with the pdf and

1566
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,760
everything

1567
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,040
but um

1568
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,600
yeah even for me like from an abstract

1569
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,679
perspective like as a beginner an app in

1570
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,280
app second general like i have to do

1571
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,800
these sorts of things like with threat

1572
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,920
modeling

1573
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,600
um so so like what are some of your tips

1574
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,000
okay well a big tip that i found from an

1575
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,040
employer from uh from a co-worker was

1576
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,560
um he uses the cis

1577
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,440
benchmark have you heard about them

1578
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,960
yeah yeah yeah

1579
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,320
yeah so he

1580
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,040
i mean to mitigate risk i guess they use

1581
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,800
a lot of the cis

1582
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,360
benchmark but as

1583
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,199
okay so

1584
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,600
in my career as a young penetration

1585
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,800
tester um i'm learning about the tools

1586
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,840
right so i think myself as a carpenter

1587
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,320
why do i say that because carpenters use

1588
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,199
tools right but then when they get when

1589
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,159
they go through age right you go through

1590
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,840
a process of

1591
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,480
time that everybody goes through and

1592
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,280
this process eventually you start

1593
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,800
learning how on the whys of the tools

1594
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,360
and that's where i'm at right now so as

1595
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,880
as the point side of as a developer

1596
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,080
um that part i am just seeing the side

1597
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,480
of the description side i'm not seeing

1598
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,440
the side of the i'll be honest of the

1599
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,840
developer and dealing with a mess

1600
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,880
you know

1601
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,760
so

1602
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,400
i don't know if i

1603
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,280
if yeah too much or no no you said you

1604
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,360
said it correctly i think that though

1605
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,199
there is like overlap in these two

1606
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,960
domains and i think we could learn from

1607
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,040
each other maybe i'm wrong because i'm

1608
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,920
new

1609
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,360
it's it

1610
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,440
so the challenges that i face are more

1611
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,880
like okay so how do we extract um

1612
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,639
domain sorry how do we extract like

1613
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,199
tribal knowledge apply domain knowledge

1614
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,480
that maybe i don't have um within a

1615
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,760
particular application catalog and then

1616
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,880
like you know create um

1617
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,000
actionable items if you will so it's

1618
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
it's it's a similar process if you

1619
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,120
really think about it or at least

1620
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,120
there's like some overlap in some in

1621
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,880
some of these things like

1622
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,400
except that i think you end up doing

1623
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,880
more like unknown environments

1624
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,480
and not getting a lot of help

1625
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,360
necessarily from from uh service teams

1626
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,280
for example

1627
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,520
okay yeah so in my case i can ask for

1628
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,159
that but like nonetheless if i could

1629
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,480
think like a red teamer

1630
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,000
or more like a wrestler i feel like i

1631
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,239
could i could i could learn

1632
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:57,760
yeah yeah

1633
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,719
yeah

1634
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,800
i mean that's i think that's you know if

1635
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,960
i can if i can get the insight and i

1636
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,800
think i'm gonna get it while it goes

1637
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,520
through time i said mine of a developer

1638
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,760
then that make me a a better assessor

1639
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,000
you know i don't sometimes i just call

1640
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,560
me an assessor that's all it is because

1641
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,560
it i assessed a cloud environment with

1642
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,800
cis benchmarks and

1643
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,679
as well as some penetration techniques

1644
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,400
that you use

1645
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:33,719
anybody else has another question

1646
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,880
no no questions for me i was in and out

1647
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,040
um i got in kind of late so

1648
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,880
i was playing catch up that's why i

1649
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,719
asked about the video so i can start

1650
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,639
from the beginning so i can fill in

1651
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,880
those gaps

1652
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,360
no problem

1653
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,719
i just wanted to thank you for having

1654
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,199
such a thorough presentation and like

1655
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:00,960
going through all these mistakes and

1656
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,000
then like troubleshooting i think that's

1657
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,600
the process

1658
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,960
yeah yeah

1659
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,840
i guess

1660
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,520
yeah these tools break

1661
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,840
all the time um

1662
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,360
and i remember when you told me i'm

1663
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:17,040
gonna put evil jinx and i ah

1664
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,080
there's a learning curve and then there

1665
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,440
is you know the record doesn't update

1666
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,880
um the

1667
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,840
user press stay signed you know there

1668
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,360
are many variables uh that may affect

1669
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,400
how the the the the learners or the or

1670
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,920
your your setup works

1671
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,520
yeah

1672
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,480
yeah yeah it was it was it took me some

1673
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,400
time to um to understand how the all the

1674
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,639
domains and everything work

1675
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,400
to set it up it was not that easy

1676
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,840
one final question promise okay so

1677
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,080
in a general sense right what do you

1678
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,800
think is the difference um besides like

1679
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,320
tooling and all that

1680
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,360
um

1681
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,600
between

1682
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,239
dependent sorry testing or assessing an

1683
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:15,440
environment that is mostly or

1684
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,280
almost entire sorry that is mostly

1685
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,639
on-prem versus a cloud environment i was

1686
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,120
thinking scale is is one general theme

1687
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,199
right but like basically how does that

1688
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:29,120
affect your strategy if at all

1689
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:33,520
um

1690
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,360
from my experience

1691
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,199
i have

1692
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,600
one okay

1693
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,760
when doing um

1694
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,960
internal external penetration testings

1695
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,239
you

1696
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,480
there's a different methods right you

1697
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,040
from external side i think that first

1698
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,880
part is the same and where you're trying

1699
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,080
to fish you know and nowadays companies

1700
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,920
are getting a lot better you see

1701
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,880
microsoft just put my email into spam

1702
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,440
right away but uh they're i'm pretty

1703
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,280
sure there are people a lot you know

1704
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,199
pros out there that can do this better

1705
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:08,400
than i can

1706
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,960
but um

1707
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,120
but as the method wise i mean if you're

1708
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,360
in if they give you an insight then

1709
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,600
you're inside no matter if if you're

1710
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,040
doing cloud of course they're going to

1711
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,040
use different type of protocols you know

1712
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,880
like like i showed the difference

1713
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,480
between oauth and l and samo and then

1714
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,800
kerberos and ntlm

1715
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,560
and then they're gonna be different ways

1716
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,159
of attacking it

1717
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:34,799
but um

1718
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:35,840
you

1719
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,239
but i i guess so i mean i guess there

1720
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,239
are some similarities but

1721
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,560
i don't know if rod you know can can

1722
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,440
expand on that

1723
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,880
it depends on what you're trying to

1724
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
assess which is i like that's why i like

1725
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,800
the way you started it

1726
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,360
like you have to see first what is it

1727
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,239
that

1728
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,639
that you are testing meaning the type of

1729
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,880
cloud service

1730
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,239
and then from there there are different

1731
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,600
strategies

1732
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,239
so it's not like one single thing it's

1733
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,560
there is and this is the point also this

1734
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,960
presentation the pen testing the cloud

1735
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,400
is not

1736
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,639
the same thing as going into a perimeter

1737
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:21,520
um and and it starts scanning for

1738
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,520
example it's completely different you

1739
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,120
don't gain anything

1740
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,320
by

1741
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,280
by

1742
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,719
um

1743
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,199
i guess owning a box if the there's no

1744
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,880
data from the company in that box you're

1745
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,040
just owning some server some real estate

1746
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,520
from the provider and that

1747
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,120
doesn't provide much value to the

1748
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,040
customer but if you are able to dump a

1749
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,520
database for example or you're able to

1750
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,000
get some data from some storage server

1751
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,280
then that is different

1752
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,080
anybody else

1753
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,040
i mean i got that grip when i started

1754
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,199
back and uh you know when we started

1755
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:08,159
back

1756
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:09,840
uh with seo

1757
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:15,239
