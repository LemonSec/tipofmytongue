1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,879
this this conference will now be

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,439
recorded

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everybody and thanks for coming um

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,360
my name is rob soto and uh we're here

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,519
today at hack miami meeting

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,720
we have a uh one of our uh best and

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,080
brightest

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
uh which is uh our very own sam

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
greenfell

uh and he's gonna like always

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,039
it's gonna give us some insight

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
has to do with ocr and exfiltration of

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,559
data

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,399
i am positive that this would be an

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,320
awesome presentation

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,879
i think this is a presentation that will

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,600
be

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,360
featured more

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,840
extensive details in las vegas

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
this year and besides specifically

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
talking about las vegas for all of you

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,559
who are not

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,600
at the discord please join discord we

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,359
are already making plans

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,400
to uh some of some will go some others

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
will be uh virtual but there's

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,680
definitely gonna

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
something's gonna happen physically in

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
vegas uh we're still waiting

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,560
uh i guess marching orders from uh from

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,880
there

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,759
come uh i understand that black hat will

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,720
be

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,840
um sort of a hybrid event and so

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
probably will be defcome uh and

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
if that's the case and and you feel

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,759
comfortable going

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
for any reasons uh i was able to get

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,600
actually very

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
cheap for um airfare so

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
this is a good time to plan and start

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,200
getting ready

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
hopefully i will see some of you there

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,759
and we get to

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
put our skills to test and maybe win

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
some

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
so uh um other than that i don't have

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
any more updates for you

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
um we're looking at june july to get a

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799
um update from the library

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,318
as soon as we get it we'll make a call

52
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,639
i would i was thinking that probably is

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
going to be

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
um after death come uh

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
if we come back and then maybe we can do

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
maybe we do one one meeting person

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
committing

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
record it or buy a assume or

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,160
go to meeting like we're doing right now

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
other than that i don't have any other

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
updates for you i'll thank you very much

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
i hope you're

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
safe and with that in mind i'm going to

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,959
give

65
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
sam the floor now

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
you have to make me presenter yes sir

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
thank you very much

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,319
you see the screen now okay i do

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,599
i do okay let's see

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
let's see if this good make go to

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
meetings little window

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
didn't doesn't or does it collapse still

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,760
i don't know

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
there it goes they changed the interface

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,720
okay oh well the

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
talking analog hole

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,080
refers to a top time back when

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
instead of these digital outputs we had

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
which kept thing

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
try to keep things perfect uh you had

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,640
these

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
infinitely varying outputs within a

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
range which you could pretty much

84
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
do whatever you wanted to with the

85
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,080
signal

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
but more specifically it refers to

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,080
the time back when uh

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
not the time necessarily but just the

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
general fact that if your eyes can see

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
something or your ears can hear

91
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,439
something then

92
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,640
the then you're always going to be able

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,319
to capture it pretty much always with

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
another device like a camera

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,720
so sam greenfeld i use

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
used various nicknames and various

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,239
nicknames because i'm a bit late to the

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,519
whole

99
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,600
uh social media party had a cissp

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,479
for about 11 years and i'm in various

101
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,600
groups

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,880
today we're going to do a bit of an

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
introduction how ocr works

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
look at some results look at some

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,199
related texts and

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,880
talk about potential counter measures

107
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
you could use

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
so optical character recognition

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
these are just in general these are

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
automated methods to identify printed or

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
potentially handwritten text in an image

112
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:46,880
the

113
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
the general tech eye concept has been

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
around with photoreceptors

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,759
as far back as the late 1800s early

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
1900s

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
many of the old older systems were

118
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
attempts at

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
doing things for the blind uh

120
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,560
around 19 1950s readers digest magazine

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
was the first

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
commercial user of optical character

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
recognition where they took

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,000
text written documents type written

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,720
documents

126
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
and made and attempted to convert those

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
to punch cards to feed into computers

128
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,919
and tabulators and other things which

129
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,120
took punch charges and puts at the time

130
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
by the 1960s you had postal services

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,759
like those in the united states and

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,039
soviet union

133
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
were using ocr to potentially to sort

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
letters and by the 1970s you have

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
had your flatbeds and you don't see them

136
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,479
anymore handheld scanners

137
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,919
uh that you could purchase at a store

138
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,720
uh ocr in general started with targeted

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
characters and fonts but it's now

140
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
more general you can feed whatever you

141
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
want to into these engines

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
and it tends to be a very mature

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,319
technology

144
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
why did i decide to look into ocr it's

145
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
widely available

146
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,759
can be done outside of a system you're

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
not going to necessarily be alerted that

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
anyone is taking a picture

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,240
of a screen uh users have to be able to

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
interact with text

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,639
if you block their access to text you

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
may make it difficult for them to do

153
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,960
their

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,319
their jobs or slow them down

155
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,319
uh text also tends to be a limited

156
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
number of colors and sizes

157
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,919
so if you put other objects on the

158
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,759
screen in an attempt to

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
uh to make copying it difficult or

160
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
make dick to put a watermark to try and

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,039
declare

162
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
ownership it's going to generally look

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,479
very different than the text

164
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,319
image precision is generally not super

165
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
important with ocr it can take some

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
tolerances it's not like we're trying to

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,039
look at a diagram on a screen when it

168
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
exactly map out the length of each of

169
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
the lines

170
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,199
ocr can be used to remove non-text data

171
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
which could be used to identify a source

172
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
uh recently you had the uh the

173
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,880
the i believe it was the intercept uh

174
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,319
news site online i saw

175
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
posted a quote-unquote reconstruction of

176
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,720
a government document as opposed to

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
posting the original they may have

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,319
learned that if

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,800
you put the exact source on they've

180
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,919
gotten good at

181
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
tracking down who who with the leaker

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
was

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,919
and also uh looked into osiri because

184
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:26,479
the focus

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
tends to be on larger data breaches at

186
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,880
the news but smaller data breaches

187
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,479
tend to do happen a lot more but you

188
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,680
just don't hear about them

189
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840
business impact if ocr could be used to

190
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
extract user data like information about

191
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
your customers

192
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
uh this is like when you have an a

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
a skimmer on an atm a gas station

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,400
a pump or a just an employee at a store

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
just going around copying credit cards

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
you may not get all of the data but

197
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,960
you'll get at least

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
some of it and then you can then

199
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
potentially mix that with data leaks

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
from other sources to obscure the origin

201
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
this could be things like company data

202
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
what was announced at your latest all

203
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,560
hands late

204
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
meaning it also could be things like uh

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,919
pricing seats and battle carts deal with

206
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
your competitors you

207
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
you could potentially lose a sale

208
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,680
because someone copied your

209
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
competitive information and not even

210
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,319
know why you lost it

211
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,080
for operations this could be small

212
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
pieces of data like firewall rules or

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,958
access keys or passwords

214
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,279
which may result in larger data breaches

215
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,320
afterward

216
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
for product development this could be

217
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
timelines of unreleased

218
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
features or potentially even pieces of

219
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
source code

220
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,920
i you can think of it like in the hbo

221
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
silicon valley series

222
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,519
where you had the uh huli duplicated

223
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,920
pied piper's algorithm by reverse

224
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
engineering it

225
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
instead what if they just had a picture

226
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
of the source code

227
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
because the core source code probably is

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
not that big and they just copied it

229
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
from

230
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
cameras in general work for both

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
monitors and paper they don't really

232
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
care what you point them in

233
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
and they're getting smarter all the time

234
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
here we're looking at samsung's

235
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,399
smartphones stock photo application

236
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
the little t in the circle icon means

237
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
it's identified there's text on the

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,560
screen

239
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
and since it found text on the screen

240
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
it's more than happy to try and help us

241
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,519
scan the document

242
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,600
in while cropping it and isolating it

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,160
from the rest of the picture

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
i did some research to try and figure

245
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
out if there were

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,800
uh known oem ocr attacks in the past

247
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,839
uh however it's a i've not had much lux

248
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,240
finding them i presume therefore they're

249
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,120
probably

250
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
this is largely a theoretical attack but

251
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
here are some examples of things that

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,240
have happened

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,839
since the start of the year which are

254
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,040
picture related the netherlands uh

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
pictures are taken of two

256
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
uh two data systems used for covet 19

257
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
testing and contract trading these

258
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,839
included

259
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
people's uh con addresses and their

260
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
national identification numbers uh

261
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
uh the criminals were caught because

262
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
they advertised that they wanted to sell

263
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
the information

264
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,399
us so these some of the screenshots

265
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,079
which were redacted and copied in this

266
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
news article show

267
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
what's obviously our spreadsheets

268
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
therefore this is i

269
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,160
prime data which you could use optical

270
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
character nation to pull the data back

271
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,839
from the pictures and then

272
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,959
exploit them by putting them elsewhere

273
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
uh from bulgaria a high viking official

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,160
spent

275
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,079
an hour and 20 minutes taking photos of

276
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,680
classified information

277
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
and get it was known to be involved with

278
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,800
uh russian

279
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
spyring uh because they didn't know the

280
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
length because of the hidden camera but

281
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
it's not disclosed what was losed and

282
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
lost in that case

283
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
and the united states here if you have

284
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,399
not familiar with the digital millennium

285
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
copyright act

286
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
every three years they have the

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
librarian of congress has to decide what

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,279
exclusions are allowed to the

289
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
uh rules about uh breaking encryption

290
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,680
and other things

291
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
to access a thing access a work in order

292
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
to do alternative things that the

293
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,079
original publisher may not want

294
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,120
here uh in one of the comments this year

295
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
the american association of american

296
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
peppers actually prefers that someone

297
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,120
would use

298
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,680
optical characterization to

299
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,480
circumventing the encryption

300
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,120
protecting a work if you are trying to

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
make it more accessible to handicap

302
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
users such as the deaf and the blind

303
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
this is not the first time this has come

304
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,079
up either

305
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,680
uh maybe a decade before uh the

306
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,160
the motion pictures association the mpaa

307
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,360
just side said that they prefer that

308
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,720
if a teacher wanted to reuse uh

309
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
information from a video they should

310
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
point a camera at a monitor and

311
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
re-record it that way

312
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
on the association of american

313
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
publishers

314
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
notes that yes this is slower but google

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
is still able to amass a huge library of

316
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,839
books

317
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
via ocr for their library search tools

318
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,839
and other

319
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
uses

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,639
so how does ocr work we're just going to

321
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,800
talk about this in general the exact

322
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
steps used in approach may vary by

323
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
program

324
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,079
first most ocr engines operate in

325
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,480
a two color environment uh

326
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
you don't necessarily care about the if

327
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
you have a colored text

328
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,519
or it's maybe grayscaled you want things

329
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,240
in

330
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
two colors to start with

331
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
next the engines will typically rotate

332
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
the image so they're in a known good

333
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,399
orientation

334
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,800
you have to normalize the size of the

335
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
image both in height and width

336
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
to match what the engine is expecting

337
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,160
the character's

338
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
size to be you have to then determine

339
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,880
what you're interested in

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
different engines may look at different

341
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
things and some engines may look at

342
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
several things

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,320
you may want to look per at characters

344
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
you may want to look at

345
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
words you may want to look where the

346
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
punctuation is or maybe at whole

347
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,720
paragraphs

348
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
uh these can maybe areas of interest may

349
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
vary by program and purpose for instance

350
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,320
if you're looking at a table

351
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
the engine may want to reconstruct the

352
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,040
table to export it to excel or just

353
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
say there's a table there if you're

354
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,360
processing form information

355
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,680
you can look and look for the form

356
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,600
fields and extract information from

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
those

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
and finally you're processing the

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
results very crudely you're going to

360
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
look per character

361
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
for character engines uh if you see one

362
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,079
thing

363
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,519
one letter you might be able to use that

364
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,040
to help you figure out another character

365
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
you were uncertain about

366
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,639
you could try to do this for the crude

367
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,880
model such as an image comparison

368
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
you may look at the glyphs say uh

369
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
capital letter a is made of two diagonal

370
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,160
lines with a horizontal line in between

371
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,639
may try to process things per word a lot

372
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,880
of ocr systems have

373
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
have been either trained on or in

374
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,399
include diction

375
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,360
word dictionaries and and when they try

376
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
if they're uncertain about a letter they

377
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
may try to guess which

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,720
word it looks the most like may look at

379
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
things per sentence just like

380
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
your type your keyboard on a smartphone

381
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,079
tries to predict what's ahead you can do

382
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,839
that with optical character ignition as

383
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,040
well

384
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
and there are lots of models out there

385
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,600
as we discussed image comparison

386
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,720
glyphs and even with you can also go

387
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
into machine learning

388
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
probably many models today use machine

389
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,440
learning

390
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
most popular neural network at least

391
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,880
they saw in some engines is the

392
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,839
long short-term memory neural network

393
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,800
model

394
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
which has a concept of forgetting and

395
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,720
remembering things for extended periods

396
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,600
of time

397
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
these are also used for voice

398
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,920
recognition in addition to other

399
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,519
language forms of language

400
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,720
processing uh

401
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
i skipped over a step because you don't

402
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
typically see it

403
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
but the first step you actually would

404
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
have to take if you're taking a picture

405
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,279
from the outside is a perspective

406
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,639
correction

407
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
which is why you saw the camera app

408
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
before show a tap to scan

409
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,600
icon so once you do that these apps

410
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,240
typic

411
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
either here or you could do this in an

412
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,560
image or on a pc

413
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,360
uh you typically mark off where the

414
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,199
edges of what you're interested

415
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,440
are in the left here we're using

416
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
samsung's app again

417
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
on the right that's microsoft lens which

418
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,480
is their

419
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,600
ocr app that you can put on a smartphone

420
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
and you can just once you do that it'll

421
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,759
crop the image and attempt to make it

422
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,800
look

423
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,279
more correct to what you would expect to

424
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,839
see

425
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
for instance uh here's a flattened

426
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
version of the image

427
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
that we were looking at on the previous

428
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
page

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
now there are some optional techniques

430
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,639
that i really aren't optional but i'm

431
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,759
to an extent they may be if you're not

432
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,399
you're just doing a pure engine such as

433
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,079
noise and line removal

434
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
you may want to remove everything that's

435
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
not text off the screen and

436
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
or if you have like a line through a fax

437
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
because of a bit error you could

438
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,639
potentially

439
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,240
get rid of it you can do script language

440
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,759
recognition if you're not certain what

441
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,680
you're looking at

442
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
some ocr engines are familiar with

443
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
hundreds of languages as long as they're

444
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,600
type written they tend to handle only a

445
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,079
few languages if they're handwritten

446
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,839
and while layout analysis isn't strictly

447
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,320
optional

448
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
you always have to identify what a

449
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
paragraph looks is or something like

450
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,519
that you could potentially be trying to

451
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,160
do that

452
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,839
to reproduce the layout in another

453
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,199
format

454
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
and reproduce the exact layout that you

455
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,959
imported into a word document or similar

456
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,359
also in the finance industry for example

457
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,160
invoices

458
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
and payment receipts and things like

459
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
that have tend to have known

460
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,119
fields you can look for and those can

461
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,039
often be processed by ocr

462
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,799
originally i was starting to think i was

463
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,559
going to write a bit of an ocr custom

464
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,199
solution

465
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
set it loose looking at a bunch of

466
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,559
images from a test

467
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,679
app and see what the results are but i

468
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,240
realize there's ridiculous number of

469
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,400
ocr engines out there already that you

470
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
can access

471
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
i don't cannot vouch for any of the

472
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
applications on this page this is just a

473
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
first page of results from the google

474
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,039
play store but even the only

475
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,000
manufacturer i even

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
recognize on this page is adobe

477
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,840
uh from a a pc perspective

478
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,080
you have if you pre ever buy a scanner

479
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,520
or you have a printer scanner that you

480
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
purchase for uses home the

481
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
software that came with it provided by

482
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
the manufacturer typically has an

483
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,720
ocr function abby fine reader puts out a

484
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,679
ridiculous number of ocr programs if you

485
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,600
want a generic purpose one they have it

486
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,559
one focused on screenshots they have it

487
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:14,960
want

488
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,160
one for four invoices they got it want

489
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
to build your own engine they'll get

490
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,240
license their engine they'll let you

491
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,080
give you an oem software version to put

492
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
in your scanner they'll

493
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,720
do they've got a lot of them

494
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
obvi page is another program i've used

495
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
in the patch

496
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,080
acrobat pro like many other programs out

497
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,640
there will

498
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
let you generate pdf files where if the

499
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,480
original was a scanned image they'll

500
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
overlay the text so you can cut and

501
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,039
paste the text

502
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
out of it there are a number of

503
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,120
cloud-based solutions from

504
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
all your major cloud providers and some

505
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
other companies such as abbey

506
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,400
if some of these will even take video

507
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
for input and

508
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,440
marked timestamps of when they first saw

509
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
text in a video

510
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,360
if you want to go the open source route

511
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
uh there are various open source engines

512
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,760
that have been out there for years

513
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
tesseract was first around commercially

514
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,080
with hewlett packard in the 80s but

515
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
they've since released it to open source

516
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
and google now maintains it

517
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
uh the one note with open source engines

518
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
is that sometimes we talked about those

519
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
pre-processing steps

520
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,080
you may become responsible for

521
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
pre-processing

522
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
the advantage with some of these

523
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,320
especially the open source engines is

524
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,640
that

525
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
if you want to do custom training data

526
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,720
sets you can do them if you have to

527
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
and there are many more products more

528
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
than i could probably ever

529
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,520
find or list here that are familiar with

530
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,120
oh they can do ocr work

531
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
as far from attackers perspective i've

532
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
considered

533
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,679
there are probably two main concern ways

534
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
of extracting data at least from a

535
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
computer

536
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,360
first is you're going to have the

537
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,760
concept of page text such as a

538
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,559
database page or looking up a piece of

539
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
information

540
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
uh where you may have more than one or

541
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,640
more similar records you want to copy

542
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,039
uh these all each appearing on a unique

543
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,000
page

544
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,520
so in this case you're just largely just

545
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
taking snapshots

546
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
if i had to design a video engine for

547
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,320
this as long

548
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
i'd largely look at the video sampling

549
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
every few frames and if the text

550
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,039
changed and stayed to a known static

551
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,600
state

552
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
aft for a second or so i'd say i'm

553
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,600
looking at a new page of information

554
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
the other thing i consider we may have

555
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,760
to be cons from a computer you ever have

556
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,240
to

557
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
look at would probably be scrolling text

558
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
such as that in a web browser

559
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
chances are someone has a very good

560
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,080
engine that follows scrolling text

561
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,760
but if you didn't don't i would say what

562
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
you could probably do here is you just

563
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
hit the page down button take another

564
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
screenshot keep redoing it

565
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,039
and this stitched information together

566
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
forgiven what you saw on the previous

567
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,200
lines

568
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
as far as results we'll look at some

569
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
results and see what we get from

570
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,960
the pictures we had previously here i

571
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
took a picture from

572
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
the picture we had been using as our

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,919
reference picture

574
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,400
and i uploaded it to google drive and

575
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,159
from google drive you can just right

576
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,919
click on the image and say open in

577
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,880
google docs

578
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,720
and this is what you get uh you can see

579
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,679
how

580
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,039
the i did a pretty decent job

581
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,760
extracting out the information from the

582
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
image

583
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,240
something i find interesting here is

584
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,080
that you can tell in the fiscal year

585
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
columns well

586
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,520
while it tried to colorize them it also

587
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,480
went red

588
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,280
downward along the things and the fact

589
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
that we have some noise in the image did

590
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
not stop this engine from

591
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
processing it here i have microsoft word

592
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,400
uh uh not microsoft word rather

593
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
microsoft lens

594
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,799
the smartphone app i used to i told it

595
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,360
i want you to go to my onedrive account

596
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,080
and upload the picture i just took

597
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,039
as a word ocr document and this was the

598
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,240
result

599
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,799
you can tell that it got a bit confused

600
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,640
not quite sure how it designed this page

601
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
the way it did

602
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
another attempt for some reason gave a

603
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,760
better result it was interesting because

604
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,080
it

605
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
kept the color colorization as best it

606
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
could of each of the table columns

607
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,840
though it missed some fields in that

608
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,000
attempt

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,440
uh looking at this i'm here i'm just

610
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
having a microsoft lens on my smartphone

611
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,000
upload the word ocr again

612
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
uh but this time i gave it a piece of

613
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
paper and while the

614
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
perspective correction isn't perfect you

615
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
can see that it managed to extract all

616
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,559
the information

617
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,960
out of it now you may be wondering does

618
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
this mean that microsoft's solution is

619
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
inferior to google's that's not

620
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,520
necessarily the case

621
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
may be that each of them is designed to

622
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
target a different environment and

623
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,400
historically

624
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,600
you if you're doing optical

625
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
characteristic recognition you're

626
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
probably doing a lot of it

627
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
against paper so they may be tuned

628
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,559
for different environments and each may

629
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,559
have their strengths and weaknesses

630
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
and which ocr engine you want to use may

631
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,639
vary on the task at hand

632
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
here i'm logged into amazon web services

633
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
console and i'm looking at one of the

634
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,039
ocr solutions and there there's at least

635
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,080
two or three you can use in aws and this

636
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,799
one is called

637
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,679
amazon techstract and just like before

638
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,360
it can take the picture

639
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
and it can extract all the information

640
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,480
out of it

641
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,440
if if the amazon thought you could also

642
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
set a tolerance where

643
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
amazon comes up with a confidence score

644
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,919
and if

645
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,840
if there's some possibly you didn't

646
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,919
understand what was in the image you can

647
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,240
uh send it over to uh review human

648
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,120
review

649
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
and set up your own board report or

650
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
within your company of people to review

651
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,159
uh potentially text that didn't come in

652
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,640
perfectly

653
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,600
here we are looking at the image again

654
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
but we this time we told text textrack

655
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
to look for the tables

656
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,799
and it went ahead and it found the table

657
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,240
and gave it to us

658
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
it's worth noting that techstract really

659
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,840
didn't care about the fact that i

660
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,640
cropped

661
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
this and did the perspective correction

662
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,679
i just gave it a raw picture of the

663
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,360
monitor itself and it was

664
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,120
happy to go in and find things

665
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,000
uh textract also can work with forms so

666
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
looking at the form we looked at before

667
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,159
you can see it's not a perfect scan

668
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,240
because the member id in this case was

669
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,000
highlighted in the text box

670
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
and therefore this ocr engine didn't

671
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
spot it however it was nice enough

672
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
to tell us that the vip member checkbox

673
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,559
was selected

674
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,159
which is not something it will do in a

675
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
mode which is not a forms

676
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,360
and the sample text track document that

677
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,720
they show in the first element actually

678
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,600
is a

679
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
handwritten document that was scanned in

680
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,960
at an angle so

681
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
just to demonstrate this is a pretty

682
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,679
flexible engine

683
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,720
since we have time i'll talk a bit about

684
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
manual noise removal if you have to do

685
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,679
that

686
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,120
if you look at our original image you

687
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,279
may notice all these wavy lines on the

688
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,720
screen that i don't know if go to

689
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,520
meeting

690
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
let's go through and you may you may

691
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,200
have seen these before while taking

692
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
pictures of screens but not necessarily

693
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,320
of a project

694
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,840
projected image that's these are known

695
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,880
as a moire

696
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
pattern uh it happens when the lensing

697
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,279
in front of the pixel

698
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,559
pixels in front of the camera are

699
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,440
are is looking in one direction but the

700
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,400
lensing in

701
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
front of the screen is pointed in a

702
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
different direction

703
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
uh the they also factor also different

704
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,200
resolution

705
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,720
results to patterns like you see here

706
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,640
this isn't necessarily guaranteed to

707
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
happen or the level and whatever level

708
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
of the pattern may change

709
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
i was actually able to take a picture of

710
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,360
the screen using a different camera at

711
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
the right angle and

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,919
not getting too much of a memory issue

713
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,720
so given an image like this how would

714
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,120
you

715
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,400
necessarily want to fix it

716
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,039
uh the moire patterns are multi-colored

717
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,320
and so i was concerned this might

718
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,679
confuse some unmodified ocr programs

719
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,600
image editors if you've looked on your

720
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
pc typically have a remover for these

721
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
but while trying to use them as often

722
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,919
blurring the text

723
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,200
but as i said before where our target is

724
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,039
two color images and text tends to be

725
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,000
one color

726
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,159
so we don't really care about anything

727
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,720
else but the text color

728
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
so one way to do this is just to ask the

729
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,120
an image editor to give us a

730
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,919
to collapse everything to two colors and

731
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,760
given the proper settings in paintshop

732
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,799
pro this was the result

733
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,360
as you notice and it came out pretty

734
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,159
good and this is

735
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,919
perfectly ocrable just to

736
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,960
add more variety i let microsoft word do

737
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
the ocr itself this time

738
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
you may not think that microsoft word

739
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,279
can ocr but

740
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,480
microsoft word can open a pdf

741
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,679
file and given a pdf file microsoft word

742
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,000
will then try to extract out

743
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,880
the text and images and process them as

744
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,200
best they can

745
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,440
so what i did is i took the picture in a

746
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
previous page

747
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,320
saved it to a pdf file and then imported

748
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,720
the pdf to word

749
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,440
and this is and it came out pretty good

750
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
if you look at it

751
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,679
uh it did not manage to convert the

752
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,360
fiscal year line

753
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,159
into text kept that as an image but

754
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,840
everything else uh

755
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
came through it's an

756
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
example again here of a failure

757
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,279
microsoft words engine didn't either

758
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
didn't like the moire pattern or got

759
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,200
confused otherwise and kept the color

760
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,080
image

761
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
as is just to show you that it really is

762
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,440
importing this as

763
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,279
a pdf file

764
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,240
uh there is an alternate method if you

765
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,960
want to re

766
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,919
really try it uh is that you can an

767
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,960
image editor

768
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,600
you can tell it to select the entire

769
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,399
image

770
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
uh often you can tell that then subtract

771
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,080
out certain colors from the selection in

772
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,720
this case

773
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
i told subtract out black give or take a

774
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,880
tolerance

775
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,559
and the res salt of that can then be

776
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
inverted and then cut in paste for the

777
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
selection then cut and paste

778
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,039
into another image and this is a good

779
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,120
way to extract out pretty much exactly

780
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
one color

781
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,200
though here we also we're trying to put

782
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,080
in a

783
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,240
remove a watermark which is something

784
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,480
why i'll get to later

785
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,399
which is why you see the little the

786
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,320
middle number is a bit blurred

787
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
because we weren't perfect at removing

788
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
it

789
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,279
some related attacks uh you could simply

790
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,080
take a picture

791
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,399
no one says you have to ocr especially

792
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,360
if you're

793
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,919
doing it as we kind of said with word

794
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:54,640
you could then

795
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,080
you can jump through hoops depending on

796
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,919
what you have available for an ocr

797
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,559
engine if you think is best

798
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
uh you could if you have access to the

799
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,919
screen you can get

800
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,159
export the file safely you could just

801
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,760
take this picture of the screen or

802
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
script the screen

803
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
you can also just do source video

804
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,960
capture i'm not

805
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,159
as long at not aware of many systems

806
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:16,960
that are

807
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,159
aware of ways of blocking that

808
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,159
something else i'll talk about is

809
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,000
accessibility interfaces because you may

810
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,279
not be familiar with those

811
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,039
screen readers such as jaws and other

812
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,720
tools out there just help the

813
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,039
handicapped have their own way of

814
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,520
interacting with applications

815
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,240
and this way may be another way of

816
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,520
extracting information

817
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,279
out of an application which otherwise

818
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
does not let you do so

819
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,039
on windows this would be through like

820
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,799
the user inter

821
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,399
interface automation framework which

822
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,399
historically was called in a previous

823
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,679
incarnation microsoft

824
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,720
active accessibility now i'm using a

825
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
tool here that interacts with the

826
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,320
user uia framework to extract

827
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
just show you that it can highlight

828
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,200
what's on the page

829
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,760
and here's the tool i was using just

830
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,039
showing you that it just gone through

831
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,480
and it's gone through the scroll unknown

832
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,880
has just

833
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,799
found everything if there were links it

834
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,000
would be able to tell me if they were

835
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,520
clickable

836
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,399
can tell me if there's until tells you

837
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,000
various other properties that may be

838
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,960
useful

839
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,679
if you are trying to make this give read

840
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,200
this line out in the screen reader

841
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,399
um it's some some tools such as

842
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,320
adobe acrobat if you have a protected

843
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,840
document you'll notice that they

844
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
let you independently say whether you'll

845
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,880
let them someone cut and paste

846
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,799
tools out and if you want to turn

847
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
accessibility on and off

848
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,600
in some cases

849
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
i don't think the tools necessarily give

850
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,919
you the option to shut off accessibility

851
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,640
or they just

852
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,200
aren't accessible accessible to start

853
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,760
with

854
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,440
when they're trying to hide information

855
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,440
so insults writing data this is an

856
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,000
interesting

857
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,080
case where if you have an ocr solution

858
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
within a company the attacker may not be

859
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,399
able to control what is used there

860
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,279
as far as importing uh fake information

861
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,159
that's probably

862
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,480
straightforward uh if you're just trying

863
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,559
to be a sales rep

864
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,080
putting in a bunch of random business

865
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,960
cards say look at all these people i got

866
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,440
or you have fake invoices and you're

867
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
trying to get them paid

868
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
you could probably do that to a company

869
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,640
the problem is the impact

870
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,240
varies by type uh if your business

871
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,919
just a sales guy faking it eventually

872
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,960
someone's going to figure out all those

873
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
email addresses or bouncing you

874
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,440
hope the finance people are doing it

875
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,120
hopefully they catch eventually in an

876
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,760
audit but

877
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,200
one never knows if you're trying to

878
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,120
put source put an actual malicious

879
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,360
program into a company i think

880
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,679
it'd be a bit more difficult with the

881
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,240
testing i've done so far

882
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,840
because if you're trying to infiltrate a

883
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,159
program let's just start with this

884
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,200
old classic program which is uh the icar

885
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,440
standard antivirus test file

886
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
this actually is an executable file

887
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,720
which works

888
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,840
on older versions of dos

889
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,120
and windows and it doesn't do very much

890
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,919
besides print the string you see there

891
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,120
but if you give it this line in its own

892
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,600
file

893
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
you save it in that file to this day and

894
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,559
you have an antivirus scan program scan

895
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:26,960
it

896
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,799
it'll treat this program as if it's an

897
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,360
actual virus

898
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,399
but if you try ocr in this line and

899
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,240
you'll find that at least in my

900
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,159
regardless of the font i tried a lot of

901
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,279
ocr engines

902
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,640
got confused they were

903
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
ocr engines in general were trying to

904
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,799
put a fine to figure out

905
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,720
this is a very long line therefore there

906
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
must be a space in the middle of it but

907
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,559
there really is no space in it

908
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,799
you have a o here which could

909
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,000
potentially be interpreted

910
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
as a zero i've seen the curly bracket

911
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,080
interpreted as in

912
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
closing parentheses

913
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,919
and so in general is the engines c

914
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,360
mostly get this

915
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
but they introduced some errors in which

916
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,600
caused the program itself to be

917
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,000
non-executable

918
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,159
it's worth noting this this program was

919
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,760
carefully designed not to have

920
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,559
any non-printable characters in practice

921
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,640
most binary files you couldn't

922
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,000
even import this way through an ocr

923
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,440
because they do have non-printable

924
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,080
characters

925
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,960
so next step let's well if we base 64

926
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,480
encode a program

927
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,039
here's a very simple program just says

928
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,919
hello world

929
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,279
again and in the base64 encoding

930
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,399
again base64 does not care about white

931
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,200
space

932
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,880
therefore we don't have to do that and

933
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,320
there's only a limited number of other

934
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
characters besides letters

935
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,240
but still do we have the i's in here or

936
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
do we have ones do we have zeros or a's

937
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,840
uh programs often try and

938
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,159
i saw attempts to try and put this in i

939
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,600
saw some cases where

940
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
certain engines were just skipping lines

941
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
when i had multiple lines of basic

942
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,399
64 in a file

943
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,719
so but it's hard to say

944
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,639
but i do i get the sense that you

945
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,320
probably have to go to a lower base and

946
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,879
there are

947
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,839
coatings that be like base 27 which are

948
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,599
specifically designed not to have any

949
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,918
characters which are confusing to an ocr

950
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,359
engine

951
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,960
and so you could do this

952
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,040
but in fact ocr reconstructions have

953
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
programs has been done most potentially

954
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
famously was

955
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,399
the pretty good privacy encryption

956
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,399
software was exported from the united

957
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,199
states

958
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,719
back at the time when you couldn't

959
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,599
legally export the binary

960
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,960
as a book and in the book the program

961
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,359
was

962
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,040
source code is printed in an ocr

963
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,719
scannable font

964
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
several copies of those books were then

965
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,159
scanned in europe

966
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,720
and then the results recombined and hand

967
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,280
checked

968
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,320
to create a version of the pptp program

969
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,359
in

970
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,760
uh in in europe that could be

971
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,599
distributed internationally without the

972
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,440
restrictions united states was putting

973
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
on it

974
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,599
but character accuracy when you're doing

975
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,040
a program import

976
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,240
has to be very accurate you may need to

977
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
know a specific font or tell the ocr

978
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,000
solution what you use

979
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,240
if you have a solution like text direct

980
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
for the open source project there

981
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,280
you can tell it i want you to run in

982
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,119
character mode and that may actually

983
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,079
work better

984
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,920
because there's no real prediction of a

985
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
word here

986
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,320
um i was you made an ocr program trained

987
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,040
to handle this kind of data or scanning

988
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,680
if it is a smarter system i think a lot

989
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,880
of the problems i ran into

990
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
is is trying to figure out what language

991
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,240
or words or whatever

992
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,480
trying to was actually going on there

993
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,920
but they weren't

994
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,000
able to figure out but this level of

995
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,760
control is not exposed in many programs

996
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,320
if you are targeting an ocr solution you

997
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
might need

998
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
more information about what it is in

999
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,800
order to help you exploit it and get a

1000
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,760
better try in the first point

1001
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,960
using base64 encodings can help you

1002
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
by bypassing some of the characters that

1003
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,760
aren't do it but then you're going to

1004
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
have to decode on the other side

1005
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
and if you're not using base something

1006
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,200
like base64

1007
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,839
uh you're going to cause additional

1008
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,520
problems

1009
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,200
uh you because uh you you have to come

1010
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,440
compile have some programs somehow on

1011
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,400
your other side

1012
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,720
which can do the decoding and if it's a

1013
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,560
bit non-standard

1014
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,000
you could also add checksums or error

1015
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
correction encodings but those

1016
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,280
definitely have to be decoded

1017
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,119
uh similar techniques though may require

1018
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,359
to infiltrate or exfoliate encryption

1019
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,839
related data a lot of encryption keys

1020
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,920
are either stored in a binary format or

1021
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,119
a base64 encoded format

1022
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,880
so the general senses i get

1023
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
is you could use these as a good thing

1024
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,079
good start

1025
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,359
if you're trying to do that but if you

1026
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,280
only have a few encryption keys you're

1027
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,320
getting rid of

1028
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,400
this might be overkill and you're going

1029
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,160
to have to do manual correction after

1030
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,799
the ocr

1031
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,320
anyway

1032
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,280
uh some counter measures uh water

1033
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,920
marking

1034
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
we're going to focus on visual water

1035
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,520
marks if you're just putting yellow

1036
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,119
printer dots or some other hidden

1037
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,160
watermark

1038
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,920
uh you're probably not going to screw up

1039
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,160
an ocr engine

1040
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,200
these are meant to be theft deterrence

1041
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,240
these may include information about the

1042
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,800
user

1043
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,320
session being used they may put the

1044
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,400
username in them session ip address

1045
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,119
things like that

1046
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,160
the cat the this presumes general though

1047
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,079
that text cannot be extracted

1048
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,760
in a way that does not preserve the

1049
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,920
water markings we talked about

1050
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
we only really care that the text on

1051
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,280
this page is black so i don't care that

1052
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,000
the watermark

1053
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,960
in the back is orange these need to be

1054
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,839
present

1055
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,320
but not overly obtrusive otherwise

1056
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,599
you'll slow down the

1057
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,240
person's job who's working on your tasks

1058
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,040
work

1059
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,200
uh a research if you're generally

1060
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,720
speaking if you're trying to

1061
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,480
work with photos a research paper pull

1062
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,839
from google shows how

1063
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,160
watermarks can be removed from photos

1064
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,960
catch

1065
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,880
very easily actually given enough

1066
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
samples the catch is is you need a

1067
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,560
static

1068
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,078
mod mark that doesn't change

1069
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,800
but if you if you add slight randomness

1070
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,560
as they show that can make watermarks

1071
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,839
harder to remove

1072
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,240
especially with photos but that may not

1073
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,200
be a concern with

1074
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,640
ocr if you only have some slight stuff

1075
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,079
in terms of of of protecting this in

1076
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,680
terms of computer software if you have a

1077
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,800
watermark

1078
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,359
when a user is using a database and the

1079
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,040
user is

1080
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,560
showing uh is us includes the user's

1081
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,599
timestamp

1082
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,280
like this is the time they started the

1083
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,200
session that may also help

1084
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,320
because you're not going to get a lot of

1085
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,280
samples of data if you keep changing the

1086
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,119
time or ip address that the user shows

1087
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,079
up is coming from

1088
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,880
and as we talked about it we're

1089
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
concerned about the things that

1090
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,680
aren't are are the same color as the

1091
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,720
text primarily

1092
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,440
so here's the image uh we i was talking

1093
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,960
about where i added an emboss to a

1094
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,760
watermark

1095
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,480
i even added a dark top to the emboss

1096
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,839
model mark instead of letting it be

1097
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,200
cleared through

1098
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,079
maybe a bit hard to tell through the

1099
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,200
meeting but

1100
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,040
the text actually gets bluer when it's

1101
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,119
over a blue section just becomes plain

1102
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,720
gray when it's over a white section

1103
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,599
uh but as discussed as if i just do a

1104
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,839
two color conversion and just

1105
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,680
extract out what's exact pretty things

1106
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,440
that around the color black

1107
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,240
uh we just we pretty much get rid of the

1108
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,160
entire watermark and then can scan this

1109
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,880
in as you can see there's some marks

1110
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
around the 239

1111
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,760
which may make it hard to ocr as well as

1112
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
the m above

1113
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,720
but other than that we've done a pretty

1114
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,640
good job of extracting the image

1115
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,560
here we have an example of a watermark

1116
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
which is actually the same color as the

1117
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,040
text

1118
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,160
color it just has made up of very tiny

1119
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,640
black

1120
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,079
dots uh so your eye interprets it as

1121
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,680
gray

1122
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,119
but you can still read the text that's

1123
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,920
over in over it

1124
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
uh again this is possibly you some ocr

1125
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,000
engines didn't seem that

1126
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
phased by this when i tried it uh

1127
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,280
uh were all but i also tried doing it by

1128
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,040
doing helping the ocr engine by doing

1129
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,280
that again forcing everything i could

1130
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,839
extract out just to get the black

1131
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,800
image of the text in the uh dotted

1132
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
thoughts in the

1133
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,079
watermark and then i just decided to

1134
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,680
remove what we referred to as salt and

1135
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
pepper noise from the image

1136
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,160
and that that that got dim the watermark

1137
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
enough to help

1138
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
make the and bring any ocr engine i try

1139
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,880
pretty much process it

1140
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,480
alternatively this could be a lot of

1141
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,240
work to remove

1142
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,760
say instead of dots i had used stripes

1143
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,839
you still probably could read this page

1144
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,079
but

1145
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,319
then the but the stripes crossing the

1146
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,000
letters would be a lot harder to remove

1147
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,920
you could also try if you're trying as a

1148
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
counter measure to avoid direct

1149
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,400
recording

1150
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,040
if you have hdmi ports or display for

1151
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
you may be familiar with high bandwidth

1152
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,400
digital content protection

1153
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,720
these are attempting to do keep you from

1154
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
copying things like blu-ray

1155
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,640
discs oh uh and so you can't

1156
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
um just store them elsewhere or

1157
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,560
distribute them on the internet

1158
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,400
in the windows you're using a protective

1159
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,599
media path

1160
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
to request this on android you're going

1161
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,440
to

1162
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,599
to set the secure flag on a window

1163
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,359
and when you do this it may turn on hdcp

1164
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:49,599
and

1165
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,880
try and protect you from extracting

1166
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
the direct recording by attaching a

1167
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
video recorder

1168
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,119
but you're still going to be able to

1169
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,680
take a picture of the screen

1170
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
if your software has good enough access

1171
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,040
to the operating system you could try

1172
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
enumerating the attached video devices

1173
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,480
look for a splitter or something like

1174
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,280
that

1175
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,560
catches you don't necessarily know if

1176
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,000
someone's using a splitter as a video

1177
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,440
extender because they're in a conference

1178
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,319
room and that's the way they're set up

1179
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
or you're not necessarily gonna have a

1180
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,880
known full database of bad devices or

1181
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,960
good devices

1182
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,880
and again you can always point a camera

1183
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,960
at the screen

1184
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
scary building screen captures something

1185
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,160
that keeps coming up again

1186
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,560
android secure flag i believe windows 10

1187
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,400
also has a windows flag that lets you do

1188
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,440
this

1189
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
uh the catch is that does not

1190
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,040
necessarily stop a non-standard screen

1191
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
recorder that does not use the

1192
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,720
operating system's default way of

1193
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,640
capturing a screen

1194
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,960
and again it does not stop you from

1195
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,160
attaching a

1196
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,319
device in the back that gives the screen

1197
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,440
capture

1198
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,800
and doesn't stop you from taking a

1199
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
picture

1200
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
some some internet sources claim you can

1201
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
rapidly flash information to avoid a

1202
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,040
direct recording my response back to

1203
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,400
this yeah you may stop

1204
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,319
confuse a video codec but if i have a

1205
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,920
camera again in front of the screen

1206
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,599
i can control my shutter speed and

1207
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,760
ideally get the information i need

1208
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,839
as we talked about you can add noise or

1209
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,359
other hormones same color as the text

1210
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,800
confuse ocr

1211
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
you can also store show a graphical

1212
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,920
window if you're trying to

1213
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,160
stop an accessibility interface though

1214
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,720
i don't know if that's not not

1215
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,319
necessarily going to stop something

1216
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,000
that's familiar with ocrin though

1217
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,440
you're trying to do protect your data

1218
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,880
probably easiest thing is only show

1219
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,920
limited

1220
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
amount of information that the data the

1221
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,200
user needs access to

1222
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,960
if the user is verified from another

1223
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,480
system you don't necessarily need to

1224
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,960
show

1225
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,319
their credit card information or

1226
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,920
anything like that not related to the

1227
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,560
reason that the user is calling

1228
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,240
you could also show different data to

1229
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,400
different users not necessarily

1230
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,240
just by role such as a call center

1231
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,319
employee and their supervisor

1232
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,960
but you could also show when you have a

1233
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,680
a

1234
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,079
a you say a test user going calling all

1235
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,680
your call center you could have

1236
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,599
that user identify as john smith to one

1237
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,640
representative

1238
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,480
and steve smith to another and

1239
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
that way if there's a data breach you

1240
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,839
could potentially identify

1241
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,359
where it came from counter

1242
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,599
corporate policies and training are a

1243
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,119
form of control

1244
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,920
uh you can always uh when i was trying

1245
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,800
to figure out what the current

1246
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,280
percentage of an insider threat

1247
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
uh employees currently were as oc i see

1248
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,520
this is primarily

1249
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,560
an insider threat but

1250
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,400
i've gotten varying results depending on

1251
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,839
how groups spend

1252
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,720
the information

1253
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,800
uh you can also do employee monitoring

1254
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,520
i would say that this is like what when

1255
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,000
your

1256
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,760
students are studying stuff remotely

1257
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,839
from home now and have their webcams

1258
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,760
have to be turned on

1259
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,720
but even then some kids are finding out

1260
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,400
ways to cheat or point their smartphones

1261
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,920
at the screen in a way that

1262
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,280
webcams don't necessarily see

1263
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,119
you can use endpoint data protection

1264
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,560
data loss preventions

1265
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,160
these are the things keeping you from

1266
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,240
using the usb ports on employees

1267
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
computers not all employers

1268
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,720
use these but if you did lose

1269
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,599
information

1270
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,599
they could potentially help you track

1271
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,359
down who was looking at the information

1272
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,359
or if they did anything suspicious like

1273
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,280
try and email a screenshot to themselves

1274
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,280
and i put presuming the user will care

1275
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,560
if they caught here because i'm not

1276
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,480
necessarily certain that's

1277
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
as strong as a deterrent is some people

1278
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,119
think it is

1279
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,599
i mean whether you believe in a certain

1280
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,800
country which

1281
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,599
is believed to have a thousand grains of

1282
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,640
sands approach to exfiltrating data

1283
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,839
or if just in general the user wants

1284
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:54,960
their way of doing

1285
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,440
things it's like like shadow i.t they're

1286
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,880
going to try and do it anyway

1287
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,240
but in conclusion if a human has to see

1288
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,240
it other devices can capture it that's

1289
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:06,720
just

1290
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,000
generally what the rule is uh

1291
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,480
i can say my view ocr may help you

1292
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,280
perform a

1293
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,839
medium-sized data breach but it may be

1294
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,000
too complicated for smaller and

1295
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,839
potentially larger compromises

1296
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,440
if you have a small compromise and

1297
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,040
you're only looking at one or

1298
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,079
a few pieces informations you may just

1299
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,480
be faster to typewrite everything

1300
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,720
reproduce it by hand if you're trying to

1301
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
obscure the origins

1302
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,160
and if you have a large compromise

1303
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,680
hopefully you've just broken into their

1304
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,880
database

1305
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,599
uh if it's a case where say you have a

1306
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:41,920
an

1307
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,599
employer who uses a call center and

1308
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,200
they're using a solution like citrich's

1309
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,079
remote

1310
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,839
desktop and app product which has gone

1311
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,280
through many names or

1312
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,480
vmware's horizon and that's the best

1313
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,400
access you can get

1314
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,440
you then yeah you could do ocr

1315
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,280
but it's going to potentially be a lot

1316
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,920
of work to extract out information as it

1317
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,319
slowly appears

1318
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,760
and that's all i've got so questions

1319
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,960
see thank you very much that was a

1320
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,839
uh awesome presentation as i expected

1321
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,000
you to do

1322
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,960
so uh i guess there are some questions

1323
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,640
already have you been answering then

1324
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,960
um no i kept i saw them coming in but i

1325
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,880
haven't looked at it

1326
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,160
okay did you answer some of them or

1327
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,800
hector says when he was trying to do

1328
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,119
what some web scraping on a project

1329
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,280
he ended up using a snapshot in ocr to

1330
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,119
pull the data he was wondering if that

1331
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,440
was common practice

1332
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,680
uh

1333
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,960
i yeah what some systems are trying to

1334
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,640
block i don't know how systems

1335
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,040
how many systems block web screening or

1336
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,760
yeah i do a lot of ui automation so it

1337
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,240
hasn't necessarily been an issue with my

1338
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,160
what i've done but i'm not like

1339
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,760
ticketmaster someone trying to block

1340
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,000
bots from being scraped

1341
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,960
or or amazon coming through and just

1342
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,000
looking at all my prices

1343
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
and updating theirs in real time in

1344
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,359
response

1345
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,440
right so but yes you can you can always

1346
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,200
use oc you could take into snapshot and

1347
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,720
ocr to pull data

1348
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,280
it's also very historically was a very

1349
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,800
common practice

1350
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,319
for screen scraping where if you have a

1351
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,160
legacy system like a mainframe and you

1352
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,839
wanted to put a web printout on it

1353
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,599
at least in the beginning you were doing

1354
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,040
things like

1355
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,359
you would you would have one system just

1356
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,200
fake out being a text terminal

1357
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
and interact with the mainframe and then

1358
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,400
it would then it would

1359
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,839
then the results would appear on the web

1360
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,160
page

1361
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,880
so that was that's an older that is it's

1362
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,480
great screen scraping is a very old

1363
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
technique

1364
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,520
yeah decent reprimands hilafax as

1365
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,200
another open source engine i'm

1366
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,119
i didn't list all the open source fact

1367
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,480
engines out there because i'm not very

1368
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
familiar with what the status of all of

1369
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,480
them are

1370
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,359
uh t-rays just using otic because

1371
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,040
probably hector says terror to raise the

1372
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,640
scandal book without opening it

1373
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,079
it applied ocr to read up pages yes some

1374
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,480
uh there there's been games played like

1375
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,240
with paintings where they would scan

1376
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,760
to see if there's painting underneath

1377
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,880
the painting as well because a lot of

1378
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,319
paint older paintings the by the masters

1379
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,960
uh they just reused uh uh previously

1380
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,319
used paintings that weren't people

1381
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,040
didn't care about

1382
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,319
uh i know there are a lot of automated

1383
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,240
book scanners as well

1384
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,160
but they typically require you to open

1385
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,040
the book i mean i i have one i don't

1386
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,760
use it very much but you just put the

1387
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,400
book flat on the page with a

1388
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
thing at a known note the

1389
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,359
binding in a known position you take a

1390
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,040
picture and then they automatically

1391
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,880
take an image from an above head camera

1392
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
and flattened it and then they flip the

1393
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,079
page and take the next page

1394
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,480
yes mine is very manual but i'm certain

1395
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,680
when google did all their

1396
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,760
ocr scanning they were using much

1397
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,280
fancier systems to do it

1398
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,839
but any other questions i still see

1399
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,119
some uh some sites are using uh captcha

1400
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,480
also i thought that should be

1401
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,319
very outdated now so with this ocr thing

1402
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,280
one could put a bot in front of a

1403
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,000
computer

1404
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,240
and defeat the capture stuff isn't it

1405
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,440
uh well you could put a con

1406
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,400
you could put something in front of

1407
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,119
computer and capture it well

1408
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,079
right if you're talking about captures

1409
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,200
yeah

1410
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,680
i have to write ocr captchas you can

1411
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,680
look into literature

1412
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,200
people try to ocr captchas all the time

1413
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
sometimes there's back doors where they

1414
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,720
found the audio captcha

1415
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,960
option of a capture was easier to

1416
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,480
process than the

1417
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,880
not than the app the written captcha

1418
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,559
so they would click the audio help this

1419
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,800
link alternatively you could just farm

1420
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,200
out

1421
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,599
as has happened to us a bunch of users

1422
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,280
the caption just have them answer them

1423
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:05,680
in

1424
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,640
near real time okay

1425
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,359
the ocr cannot sell

1426
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,040
the ocrs it depends on the type of

1427
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,200
capture if you're just showing a text

1428
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,280
and saying with some lines through it

1429
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,599
yes that maybe ocr can solve

1430
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,680
if you're going to what google well

1431
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,680
recapture is doing now where it's saying

1432
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,319
identify all the chimneys in these

1433
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,760
images

1434
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,800
or all these sidewalks or lights and you

1435
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,920
don't know if they're necessarily

1436
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,800
wanting you to select the poll or not

1437
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,440
the those types of things and ocr

1438
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,200
solution is not going to solve

1439
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,440
on its own without a lot more artificial

1440
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,480
intelligence stuff tied to it

1441
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,160
yeah yeah and as they say security

1442
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,000
it depends on how much you are willing

1443
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,200
to spend

1444
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,319
because if you want to look at

1445
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,440
the uh self-driving cars

1446
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,720
the reason why they are able to

1447
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,119
self-drive is because someone has spent

1448
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,160
tons of money to take a lot of images

1449
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,880
a lot millions of images and load it

1450
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,280
into

1451
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,000
the chips so that they could look

1452
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,559
through

1453
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,520
very quickly and make decisions so even

1454
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,400
the so-called

1455
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,680
uh chimneys in the picture if you are to

1456
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,319
load

1457
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,440
all different images into your uh but

1458
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,119
also then they will be they will still

1459
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,800
be able to solve a bet

1460
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,520
because yeah are you willing to actually

1461
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,400
spend that

1462
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,800
amount of money just because you want to

1463
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,240
hack some uh

1464
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,680
uh site also that's the question

1465
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,240
well i'll just say it's also i'll also

1466
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,119
point out

1467
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,440
that you can't necessarily fully rely on

1468
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,559
ocr

1469
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,480
you need context for instance and or

1470
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,559
or in your system has to be smart enough

1471
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,559
to realize things for instance

1472
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,319
in southern georgia i believe on what is

1473
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,240
it interstate 75

1474
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,720
uh you will have signs that say speed

1475
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
limit 70 miles per hour

1476
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,119
then you will have separate signs not

1477
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,280
stacked underneath the other sign

1478
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,319
that says minimum speed 60.

1479
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,319
so if you look at my one of my gps is

1480
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,880
uh it get it keeps going back and forth

1481
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
the speed limit on that road being 70

1482
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,160
versus 60.

1483
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,800
and if you have a newer car which also

1484
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,760
is trying to show you

1485
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,200
on its own littlest heads-up display

1486
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,720
that oh i just saw the last speedlimp

1487
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,280
sign was 70 and then they go to the 60

1488
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,160
area

1489
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,160
uh and it says oh the speed limit sign

1490
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,920
says 60 is it suddenly going to slam on

1491
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,960
its brakes

1492
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,000
if it's on the if it's speed limit

1493
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,920
and if it's on cruise control and say oh

1494
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,280
i have to slow down now even though it

1495
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,160
misread the sign

1496
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,280
yeah interesting

1497
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:57,359
any other questions

1498
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,880
all right then uh we'll see you guys

1499
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,680
soon

1500

hey rod i thought

1506
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,480
uh after the presentation you were going

1507
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,599
to uh

1508
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,359
talk about uh folks uh because we've

1509
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,240
we actually tried to do this as our

1510
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,359
always possible

1511
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,200
that yes people come in to always for

1512
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,119
cpes uh maybe perhaps to

1513
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,079
keep in touch or get up to date to the

1514
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:36,720
trend

1515
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,520
also but another one that we also want

1516
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,280
to try to do is so

1517
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,319
the new folks who may be interested in

1518
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,960
actually breaking into this uh

1519
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,160
security field because yes you said

1520
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,319
there are tons of jobs but when you want

1521
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,079
to apply they say you don't have

1522
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,280
experience and then at times if you have

1523
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,720
experience they will say you don't have

1524
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,000
cissp

1525
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,319
and then once you have the cssp they go

1526
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,599
back again and say you don't have

1527
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,400
experience

1528
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,640
so what would be your advice also or

1529
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,079
anyone on the

1530
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,359
on at least on the meeting also that you

1531
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,520
will actually advise folks who are

1532
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,920
trying to break into this field like

1533
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,880
they have

1534
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,880
experience in credit card tokenization

1535
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,599
experience with privacy and perhaps a

1536
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,640
little bit of

1537
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,760
project management

1538
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,400
um let me uh actually i'm gonna start

1539
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,960
the recording
