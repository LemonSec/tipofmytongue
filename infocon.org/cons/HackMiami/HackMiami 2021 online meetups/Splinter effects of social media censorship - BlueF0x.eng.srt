google yet

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,120
or any other bigger company but

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
you know to be part of a company where

basically fly hops for almost everybody

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199

and uh it's not easy to get in there and

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,560
it's not easy to say

26

so uh you you um

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520

you're good to go okay all right

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,280
so um basically

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
i guess what everyone's been noticing

89
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,799
lately about like what's happened

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
with the january 6

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
the actual siege of the u.s capital

92
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,480
and about how like how people were

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
basically communicating

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,799
up until and during and even short time

95
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
short time after um like how these

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,319
organizations

97
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,600
these uh basically uh militia based

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
groups were able to talking and

99
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,479
basically how like also too where

100
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,680
we're saying we're going to talk about

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
like where does the line

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,199
draw between like constitutional free

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,479
speech

104
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,680
and then also how corporations

105
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
you know implement bans and how they

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,000
interpret free speech

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
so so basically this is what i said what

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
i'm talking about is the splinter

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
effects of social media censorship like

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,960
we're

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,800
basically free speech versus corporate

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
policy on speech

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
um basically uh this is who i am i'm

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
in the veteran uh experience and both

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,199
like

116
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,840
mostly in regular communications a

117
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
little bit of satellite

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
um overseas quite a bit

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,520
um that's where i kind of splintered off

120
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,759
with like learning more about tactical

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,039
information uh going into computers was

122
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,600
roughly

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
just before um i went into the law

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,639
enforcement

125
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,880
and then also too during this top two

126
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
also all

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,400
like i was explaining a little bit about

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
how the

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,360
the barriers and the procedures were

130
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
done at the capitol you know as best i

131
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,919
could from

132
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,840
what i got trained on and uh currently

133
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,479
right now

134
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
is where i pointed out working at a

135

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
auxiliary

174
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
where basically i the marines

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
invite me to a special conference and

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,639
and the base i am put

177
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
as an advisor and i assist them which

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
recently they just conducted a

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,520
service-wide ctf and they

180
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
sent me a certificate for appreciation

181
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
helping them out

182
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
so if you do get a chance if you're just

183
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
starting up or

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
want to continue going into infosec

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,199
cyber security

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
i would suggest looking into these

187
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,240
organizations and

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,120
like network and build up your knowledge

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
um so free speech like how

190
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
like we always talk about like we we

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,879
shouldn't

192
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,199
speak versus we should be and like this

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,240
quote here about

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,759
to announce that there must be no

195
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,360
criticism of the president or that we

196
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,639
are to stand by the president

197
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
right or wrong it's not only not

198
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
patriotic and surgical

199
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
but it's morally treasonable to the

200
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
american public

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
and our former president a long time ago

202
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,319
theodore roosevelt said website

203
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
but that's like it's important about how

204
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
free freedom of speech is

205
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,560
so in the freedom of speech we have all

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,759
these apps and

207
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
like in doing so we have all these built

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
up social media websites and apps

209
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,440
and for the last year alone like these

210
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
were the most popular ones

211
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,559
um so like we had like instagram for

212
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,958
like mostly for photos but

213
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
uh like i'll go into later like you'll

214
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
see like how

215
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
these organizations of the militia

216
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
groups in the far right or far left

217
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
groups were like using these

218
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
and then also too like how that youtube

219
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,160
they were

220
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,360
streaming um actual video

221
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
like of various offices are on the

222
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
senate floor

223
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,360
uh same thing for facebook which is you

224
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,160
know they own

225
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
instagram but they also posted to like

226
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,959
pictures and videos

227
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,080
such as twitter uh most famous like

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,480
where

229
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
trump was like broadcasting his words

230
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,440
that's where he had the most audience

231
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,399
and he was most influential from there

232
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
and then tick tock was uh somewhat

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
there but they were they were show clips

234
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
but they were mostly interfacing onto

235
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
like say like facebook or youtube

236
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,920
now last year

237
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,839
uh actually as of the january this month

238
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
um from a company called statica they're

239
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
based out of hamburg germany they

240
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
basically do factories

241
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,680
and statistical analysis on like various

242
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
subjects

243
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
and i was able to get a basic

244
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,399
snip of it and showing like basically

245
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
how many users

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
you know like around the world like how

247
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
many people are using

248
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,800
facebook youtube and these other various

249
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
apps

250
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,519
right now parlor wasn't up there yet

251
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,000
because it was i mean it just was

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240
founded like in 2018 but not too many

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,800
people were on it at the time

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
but you can clearly see like where the

255
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,079
most influence

256
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,040
is like even today and not just like

257
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,760
related to

258
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
the capital being but just like in

259
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
general in everyday life or you see

260
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,079
people

261
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,839
talk on

262
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,200
now for instagram they

263
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
launched in 2010 this started as a phone

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,640
app

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
um and high popularity because it's like

266
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,640
what they can what

267
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
you know what can do with right uh game

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,720
that i mean

269
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
um gain that many users

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
uh within a short amount of time and

271
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,360
then of course

272
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
like with any type of app you know a

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
bigger company will see the advantage i

274
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,440
was like okay

275
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
we'll take a ticket up um and then see

276
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
if they'll do a purchase on it because

277
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
if they can't be and they can buy

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,920
them and then of course to also like

279
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
basically as of this year like you can

280
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
see like the number of people

281
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,800
who lose it is roughly 140 million

282
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,680
now just think about this like if you

283
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
have an organization

284
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
that is not exactly on the good side

285
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
just using instagram to be able to talk

286
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,959
to each other they can still

287
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,440
like use this in various communication

288
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,240
methods like if they want to like

289
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
do like a geolocation tag like say like

290
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
they want to do a meeting

291
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
and they share it with a certain group

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,079
inside instagram they just take a

293
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,040
picture

294
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,440
and you can extract the edgefield data

295
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
off of it it's like hey you know we're

296
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
meeting here

297
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
or basically they even have to post a

298
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,200
date it just shows a picture of

299
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
where they they took and says this is

300
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,560
where me for this month

301
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,680
um now this is what uh with

302
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,399
now again facebook owns instagram but in

303
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,320
a way instagram had its own rules or a

304
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,240
certain descent

305
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
and basically what they were somewhat

306
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
like um

307
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,480
they don't allow the following groups

308
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
for a page a group an event

309
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
or such a platform or profile on their

310
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,560
platform

311
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
that had to basically it was related to

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
a

313
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,399
militarized social movements how they

314
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
they specified in their policy

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,920
and then they said that they support and

316
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
organize violent hats

317
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,959
and bid protests now

318
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,079
the what didn't happen though was

319
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,360
initially is

320
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,959
what they were talking about is it

321
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,120
basically like a protest

322
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,800
or um just like a speech that was being

323
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
presented by

324
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,040
saint trump and that's why they were

325
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,920
able to

326
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,639
communicate on this for a while they

327
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,680
were just

328
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,519
just being out of the norm like this is

329
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,079
normal democratic

330
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,000
stuff that in the process of like like

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
politics like okay so listen

332
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
to my speech let's show up

333
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,800
now they after

334
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
the siege though instagram noticed that

335
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
they would double down on to like what

336
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,839
their

337
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,240
moderation was and basically they saw

338
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,839
like how many people

339
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,160
uh where all of these events

340
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
these groups existed and they realized

341
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
that they were actually

342
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,519
much more widespread in instagram alone

343
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,240
than they initially thought so it shows

344
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,959
you here like

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,639
how they also remember the ball 3 300

346
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,519
pages

347
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,880
over 10 000 groups 500 over 500 events

348
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
and then of course two you can actually

349
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
link it

350
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,000
to your facebook profile so that's how

351
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
they were able to make the connection

352
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
there

353
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
okay now facebook we all know about

354
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,199
facebook

355
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
started harvard and bob zuckerberg

356
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,480
um we know about the movie um

357
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
so basically like how there was like a

358
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
social network how it was initially set

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,199
up

360
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,320
and then it just exploded uh

361
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
so it's like how more people nowadays

362
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,959
talk

363
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,360
especially now given with the coconut

364
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
thing going on so everyone's social

365
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
distance

366
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,440
so everyone's still be able to share

367
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,399
and talk to each other um even like my

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,600
daughter's

369
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,680
um softball team they they use facebook

370
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,639
now me personally i don't i got rid of

371
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,360
facebook

372
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,199
long time ago for privacy reasons uh but

373
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
for for obviously but for the general

374
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
purpose reasons though that

375
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
these militia groups they were using

376
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
facebook just to communicate with each

377
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
other if they didn't use

378
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
like direct you know phone call phone

379
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
calls it

380
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,519
message from one person to another or if

381
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,360
they want to organize

382
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
a beating again facebook was a platform

383
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,320
it was just like it's there um and

384
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,880
again like instagram no one was really

385
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,320
like

386
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,279
you know unfortunate to just like

387
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,800
because they didn't realize like whether

388
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
they thought it was nearly generally

389
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
protected on freedom of speech

390
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
and they were allowed to organize

391
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
allowed to talk get together

392
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,880
but again it's like they

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,360
they took advantage of it and then they

394
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,120
did and that's how they were widespread

395
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
um and now with facebook directly

396
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,000
they have their they have their own

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
direct standards

398
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
and see like they said we also give

399
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
people control over their old experience

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,680
by allowing them to block

401
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,480
unfollow or hide people and post so like

402
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
if somebody

403
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
initially saw something that they were

404
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
offended by

405
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
you know it gave the people in facebook

406
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,959
to say no i'm not interested

407
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
they move on right and if they

408
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,320
complained about it

409
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
of course it was probably done as a

410
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
ticket submitted up

411
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,279
and then someone reviewed it and

412
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,440
par possibly laughed it for like last

413
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,040
year probably wasn't nor because it was

414
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,000
protected

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,320
under free speech because they were

416
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
allowed to do

417
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
whatever is initially what they were

418
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,959
allowed to do where it was like to talk

419
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,160
about or

420
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
what they said now

421
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,519
they said down here like you know we

422
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,160
remove content

423
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
and the disabled accounts work in law

424
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,079
enforcement if

425
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,399
believe there's a genuine risk of

426
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,680
physical harm or direct

427
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
threats to public so like if they

428
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
bluntly blankly just said

429
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,439
i'm going to do this to this person or

430
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,160
to this building yeah

431
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,959
then they were able to actually do

432
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,480
something about that and then

433
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,599
forward it to law enforcement but

434
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,799
beforehand though it was if they didn't

435
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,079
meet that criteria they they could issue

436
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,000
warnings uh they could make suggestions

437
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
but not much beyond that though at least

438
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
onto their students at least

439
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,960
up until the actual siege

440
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,160
uh okay so now twitter this was like the

441
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,799
the main one that trump was using during

442
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,000
his speech rallies

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
and like he was trying to to organize

444
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,000
people to do

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,360
the march uh about the election

446
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,039
and about how like he disagree with it

447
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
excuse me and about how the election

448
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
process was done

449
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,850
versus like how it should have been done

450
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,760
[Music]

451
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
so on his account his twitter account he

452
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,919
would like have all his followers and it

453
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,720
was just

454
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
spread out easily to other trailer users

455
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,720
and

456
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,360
other platforms like instagram facebook

457
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,000
youtube

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
right so

459
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,559
and then like here like how it was

460
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,919
formed and basically it it

461
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
it was it was not meant to be like what

462
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
it was

463
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
for like to be take advantage of like

464
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,360
what happened

465
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,559
on january 6th this was just like an

466
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,120
honest

467
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,039
like you know you know talk to talk or

468
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,760
peer-to-peer or to be able to share

469
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
information and thoughts in general

470
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,559
right

471
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,400
but again you see um

472
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,559
like how many users in the millions use

473
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
twitter and this is uh i do believe

474
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,679
in 2020. so that

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,960
he shows how many people in the u.s uh

476
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,400
basically were using twitter

477
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
so it gives you an idea like how wide

478
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,039
spread is so again another platform

479
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
for these militia groups you take

480
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,640
advantage of

481
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,679
and get information out

482
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,840
and then also too just not just militia

483
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
with everyone

484
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
who is like they can express

485
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,160
the freedom of expression about how or

486
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,400
what

487
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
all right so these were

488
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
not all organizations but these were

489
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,200
just like the key ones that

490
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,240
i was able to basically just be able to

491
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,960
find

492
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
um pretty easily and these were

493
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
like the most popular ones the ones that

494
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
showed up initially on

495
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
both the photos and the videos at the

496
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
actual capital siege

497
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,559
um so basically like for example if

498
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,480
we're starting with the oak keepers

499
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
these are the people who

500
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
who were in the military or in the

501
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,080
police who took that oath about

502
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,039
you know the fans that gets all enemies

503
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
for a domestic

504
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
and they took it like not one step

505
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,520
further but like

506
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,440
way more further like it it's

507
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,919
it's kind of hard to explain but it's

508
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,080
they

509
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
were just real hardcore defenders like

510
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
that they were just

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
adamant like they believe that if

512
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
even out of the service or out of the

513
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
the police that you still had to

514
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
maintain that oath

515
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,760
which in in the spirit of it it is noble

516
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,039
but it's how you how you

517
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,159
enforce it how you use that of

518
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,520
though that's the difference

519
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
um and then antifa they were there also

520
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,799
they were with my research they were

521
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,440
either trying to

522
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
like counter counter force the other

523
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
organizations

524
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
but then also even then some of them

525
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,720
were

526
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
kind of went kind of rogue too and they

527
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
kind of did their own

528
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,919
actions to a certain extent so even

529
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,080
then they were seeing kind of like

530
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
breaking the law just the very least

531
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
i like all these organizations they were

532
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,520
trespassing at the

533
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,640
at the very least on government property

534
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
um and then you have like the quant like

535
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
like have these people they have the big

536
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,159
q flags they were marching

537
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,080
uh in all the protests up until

538
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,799
and then all like the actual speech that

539
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,600
trump gave

540
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,080
in dc that far from the capital

541
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,320
uh like they basically like they were on

542
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
trump's side and they believed that

543
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,080
um there was a conspiracy and that

544
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,120
the election was rigged and then

545
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,280
it was basically it just kept feeding

546
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
itself over and over

547
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
um another group the three percenters

548
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,600
the another far-right group

549
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,399
they were

550
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,799
basically founded as in like basically

551
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
believing that only

552
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,320
three percent of the americans were

553
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
fighting against the british at the time

554
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,080
during the revolutionary war

555
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,120
but again they still

556
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,240
believe that the election was rigged

557
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
and they said that's why they are

558
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,000
marching with these other groups also

559
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,520
and then uh lastly on here

560
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
is the proud boys where you can

561
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
recognize them

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,559
by they're seeing them wearing their

563
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,400
orange uh

564
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
caps or a head gear and

565
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
and you can see like basically

566
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,520
they were glorified nazi neo-nazis at

567
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
the very least

568
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,360
and we know how that can be prostrated

569
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
um so like all these groups here these

570
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,039
were these were just

571
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,520
like the majority now there was more

572
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,159
groups

573
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,640
but they were smaller and less organized

574
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,559
but they were but these were the like

575
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,400
the main ones that we saw like

576
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,640
um like inside the capitol building

577
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
itself

578
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,200
now now you see here

579
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,480
like in this photo like this is

580
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
the building right here this is like one

581
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,200
of the main doors to get into the actual

582
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,159
building itself and you can see already

583
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,120
they've already

584
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
done extensive damage to the both the

585
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
the outer pane window

586
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
and then also like even the door knobs

587
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
because they were

588
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,520
at least this one was like broken off so

589
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,039
they're already at this point

590
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,640
you can see here like they were serious

591
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,320
about getting inside

592
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,559
so um what here is i'm going to discuss

593
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,640
like a general timeline

594
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
about the events of it about what the

595
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,559
organizations are

596
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,760
doing so

597
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,080
all right so like before noon this is

598
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
like roughly up until

599
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,799
january 6 where you

600
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,080
had to like get

601
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
to get together using the various

602
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
platforms i could like discuss like

603
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,679
instagram facebook

604
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
uh twitter um and you basically had

605
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,240
trump

606
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
who's you know talking about the

607
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,760
election

608
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,600
it's specifically like even around

609
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
november time

610
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
and that later just with the fuse and

611
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,279
then

612
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,200
basically people are now organized

613
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
together

614
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,400
and basically do an actual march in dc

615
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,320
but from

616
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,159
the uh the analysis

617
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,320
from the fbi and other law enforcement

618
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,840
agencies

619
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
they were basically looking into like

620
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,080
okay we were just going to do a

621
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,000
march and then we're just going to show

622
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
up at trump's

623
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,679
rally and to support route and support

624
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
trump

625
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,360
um but then right after

626
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
like right just like when you get into

627
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
the speech things start to change

628
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,320
um i do believe rod approached

629
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,279
something on our discord channel that

630
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,880
there was a couple links where like you

631
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
had um

632
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,480
people using their regular phones and

633
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,279
even someone with their burner phones

634
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,480
had

635
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
google services turn on so you still

636
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,200
track people um it's because they're

637
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
logged into google and google just

638
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,279
immediately tags your phone and it

639
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,760
allows you to track you

640
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
so that's another way that's how the the

641
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
law enforcement were able to find people

642
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,960
now

643
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
this is when like the timeline work like

644
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,039
between the speech

645
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,600
where basically trump is telling people

646
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,080
to walk to the capitol you have to keep

647
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,840
his quote was you have to show strength

648
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,799
so people didn't interpret that as is

649
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,000
like okay we need to

650
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
stand up for ourselves we need to show

651
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,279
congress that

652
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,640
this was not tolerated the election

653
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,919
needs to be run again

654
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,640
or invalidated and such

655
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
and now into a little bit later

656
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,000
uh before his trump speech ends

657
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,919
um you start to see people going from

658
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,360
the trump's rally speech um

659
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,799
and start drifting towards the capitol

660
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,960
and you can and there's there's links

661
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,559
there's multiple website

662
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,120
web pages where people have actually

663
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,159
captured

664
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,960
from like um trackers that basically

665
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,520
show

666
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,679
people's phones like the one i showed

667
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,559
you

668
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,000
and you'll see them migrating from the

669
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,480
actual

670
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
speech to the capital at least to the

671
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
outer the outer ring

672
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,919
the the outer perimeter of it right

673
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,600
and then that's where you start seeing

674
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,280
like people are getting physical

675
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,960
[Music]

676
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
um they're start protesting there's it

677
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,480
right now at this

678
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,760
at this time it was mild it was mild

679
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,720
there's like maybe basically law

680
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
enforcement there at the time

681
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,559
they could handle it there was no no

682
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,000
real danger of it

683
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,799
but then as more people started getting

684
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,600
away from

685
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,520
the rally then they realized that

686
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
they were starting to get past the the

687
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,120
actual rails where the police were so

688
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
then it starts to

689
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,799
start to condense and they're coming

690
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,080
into the actual

691
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,520
like area of the capital

692
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,120
and then as here at this time island

693
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,919
trump we're saying

694
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,880
okay basically he concludes the speech

695
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,320
he's saying

696
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,039
you know walk down pennsylvania on you

697
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,520
and then

698
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,840
towards the capitol so

699
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,600
he almost directly but it's very at the

700
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,559
very least

701
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
strongly indirectly says go to the

702
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,159
capitol

703
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,440
and basically protest there about what

704
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
happened

705
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
and about how the legend was rigged

706
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,000
again

707
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
this is from twitter this is from

708
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,640
facebook this is from

709
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,600
uh instagram you know but mainly twitter

710
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,000
because

711
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
he was constantly just sitting out

712
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,360
tweets constantly

713
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,120
about this now

714
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,320
at that time twitter was

715
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,919
like i believe it was like the first

716
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,760
platform where they started to like okay

717
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,559
we can't confirm this or like this could

718
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,600
be

719
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,279
um like not accurately portrayed so

720
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,640
that's when he put that little link a

721
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:00,960
little

722
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,840
hypertext in his tweets saying like you

723
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
know this is not from a trusted source

724
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,640
or

725
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,840
just could be a rumor you know don't

726
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,640
take it

727
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,399
you know you know take it with a grain

728
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,320
of salt basically

729
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,120
um but still he was still allowed to

730
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,799
tweet out

731
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,880
at that time like like you know what how

732
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,279
he felt

733
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,960
and then as you can see

734
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,679
right here like you the protesters get

735
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,039
more and more in numbers and they're

736
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,880
clashing with the officers

737
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,399
and even then when they call in for

738
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
backup

739
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,520
um there's actual videos again

740
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,279
the videos of them are all over the

741
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,799
internet there's even

742
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
like it's three buckets and amazon were

743
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,080
like this

744
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,200
like over gigs a video

745
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
where like in this case like i've seen

746
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
videos where

747
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,799
the protesters themselves had brought

748
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,360
bear mace actual bear mates and spraying

749
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,880
it into

750
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,440
the actual officers who were holding the

751
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,480
perimeter

752
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,320
and they're trying to get inside

753
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,600
and then here is another platform around

754
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480
2 p.m

755
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
a live stream comes up a

756
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,679
breach of like a massive crowd from the

757
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,520
same

758
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,640
uh group of people that the at the uh

759
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,799
speech that trump just concluded

760
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,279
going to the east side of the capitol

761
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,640
and basically

762
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
this is the last physical bearer

763
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,279
protecting that static so basically

764
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,360
they're all there's nobody nobody else

765
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,320
was guarded so now we get to

766
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,360
like the actual door essentially

767
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,039
like of the actual entrance and then

768
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
people are just

769
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,000
trying to get inside and then uh

770
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,360
roughly about 10 minutes after that

771
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,919
on the northwest side of the capitol um

772
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,960
another stream

773
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,320
again youtube using in

774
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,120
the militia groups using this platform

775
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,799
to encourage people to show like hey

776
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,279
this is what we're doing is you know

777
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,960
we're inside right now we're getting

778
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,279
ready

779
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,600
to storm the gates basically

780
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,720
and again so now basically

781
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,559
the capital is virtually vulnerable on

782
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,120
the outside

783
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,320
and then uh

784
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,799
basically right now you have like

785
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,159
breaking into the building

786
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,320
now they're

787
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,279
they have strengthened numbers and

788
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,880
basically they had like

789
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,360
tools and the tool and then we later

790
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,640
find out they actually had some of them

791
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,039
actually did have weapons

792
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,120
but for at least for the the video

793
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
footage i've seen

794
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
they just either had their bare hands or

795
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,320
just like small tools and they're

796
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,600
literally just breaking and entering

797
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,480
this is like a

798
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,039
massive breaking and entering and then

799
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,880
burglary at the very least too if they

800
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
steal something but

801
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,120
that again that they're basically the

802
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
intent was to get inside

803
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
and go after the congress

804
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,360
to protest the election was rigged

805
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,559
now there was reports of inertial

806
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,360
footage too

807
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,240
and it's graphic i didn't share it but

808
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,960
it was a

809
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,159
an air force veteran who was a quantum

810
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,600
believer

811
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,279
that you know about the election being

812
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,559
rigged and wanted to

813
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,200
storm basically institute inside the

814
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,640
area where

815
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,760
the where

816
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,279
some of the congressmen have not

817
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,039
evacuated yet they were just on lockdown

818
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,480
they couldn't get out of town so they

819
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
had to basically shelter in place

820
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
and this is kind of like getting into

821
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,840
like a school shooting where to a point

822
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,720
like okay

823
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
if you can't get out you gotta shelter

824
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,840
in place

825
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,679
so they took everything and this is

826
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,320
where is as

827
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
as accurate it sounds like this is like

828
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,559
like a drill where i had to

829
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,480
uh when going to the police academy

830
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,000
where you have people

831
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,399
basically getting your stuff and taking

832
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,919
whatever firms yourself around

833
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,559
barricade the door and you also had

834
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,039
still have

835
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,000
capital police in there too who are

836
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
basically just hole in the ground

837
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,799
and then this one vet who tried to get

838
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,760
through that berry

839
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,880
on the inside basically got shot and

840
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,559
that's

841
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,200
that was the main one we we saw about

842
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,919
and heard about

843
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,080
the news um so

844
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,240
so they're basically inside and you and

845
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
again from the videos and those

846
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,440
clippings

847
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,360
you can see them now they're just

848
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,279
they're the inside

849
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
they're on the floor they're taking

850
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,880
pictures

851
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,960
um let me see

852
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,880
yeah let's see here so like like right

853
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,320
here

854
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,000
so you can see like how they're like

855
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,039
they're just taking pictures

856
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,320
so again they're they're using those

857
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,159
platforms

858
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,520
like youtube uh twitter facebook

859
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,480
instagram they're like hey we're doing

860
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,520
this we got in

861
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,918
you know we're showing that we are in

862
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:24,879
charge

863
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,359
congress is not we're here to tell you

864
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,918
that the election is rigged

865
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,399
and you know just getting their beliefs

866
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,040
out

867
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,159
now what they don't know

868
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,119
is how massive the open source intel

869
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,320
they just released up

870
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,079
about themselves because some were not

871
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,560
even wearing masks

872
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,040
and that was and because a lot of these

873
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,879
phones

874
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
um like like these high quality phones

875
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,159
like they're like

876
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,199
5 10 megapixels so they're

877
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,040
high def and you can clearly run those

878
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,680
against

879
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,160
like a a driver's license database to

880
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,560
get

881
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,680
the fbi can get access to and or even if

882
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,240
they're

883
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,880
they're in the ncic already someone

884
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
could be

885
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,520
felons and they could easily determine

886
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,079
like okay yeah this is this person

887
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,440
right because you were there the the

888
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,560
the photo the video alone

889
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,480
is solid evidence where you show the

890
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,760
background

891
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,680
it's clearly not edited it's clearly

892
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,599
real time

893
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,599
and showing like yeah they were there at

894
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,839
the time uninvited which means they're

895
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,279
trespassing at the very least

896
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,720
now the one scene where i think probably

897
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,760
some of you might have

898
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
heard about where it is officer eugene

899
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,119
goodman he was a

900
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,560
um a us or he still is

901
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,200
a uh capital us capitol police officer

902
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,160
where

903
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,720
basically we see him you see my scene a

904
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,040
photo where he's holding up my tap baton

905
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,599
and try to hold people back well there

906
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,960
is a video of him

907
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,599
where he is confronted with a large

908
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,560
group of these people

909
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,040
and they're trying to get into the

910
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,560
actual like offices

911
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,920
where the congressmen were so he knew he

912
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,880
was outnumbered

913
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,400
flat out so

914
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
one of the things that they taught me in

915
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,680
law enforcement

916
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,960
was to de-escalate

917
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,119
and the this was key because he knew

918
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,760
that he was not able to like

919
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,440
stop him period there's no way he

920
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
doesn't have the numbers

921
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
so what he did was he was being like

922
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,880
basically like a rabbit like

923
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,079
they know they're focused on him

924
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,560
and they know that he's the capital

925
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,359
police

926
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,200
so he's trying to keep their focus on

927
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,480
him and not on

928
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,200
congress so you can see him going up the

929
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,160
steps

930
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,320
and trying to like tease them and lure

931
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,680
them away

932
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,440
because he knows that he's trying to buy

933
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
time because i mean and that's all he

934
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,079
can do he's buy time

935
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,839
and so that's what he was really good at

936
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,240
because he kept them like

937
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,920
somewhat like calm

938
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
but then also interested on him so he

939
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,640
kept following him over and over

940
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,400
until he can get enough time where

941
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,160
enough like where

942
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,680
the congress can either be evacuated or

943
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,520
at the very least be securely locked

944
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,480
down through their rooms

945
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,560
and then after short that some time

946
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,680
after that

947
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,839
that's when they're actually then you're

948
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,280
just completely

949
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,440
nearly completely both the the capital

950
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,320
areas where

951
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,240
there's no barricades and like again

952
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
they're on the floor

953
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,440
um they're going through papers they're

954
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,480
that one guy who was in nancy pelosi's

955
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,359
office

956
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,560
just you know again just using those

957
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,280
platforms

958
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,400
you know networking showing off like hey

959
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,520
we did it we're you know this is me you

960
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
know don't you know

961
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,599
they're in the office and uh

962
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,000
and then basically that's when the you

963
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,640
had the

964
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,400
the shelter in place going on where like

965
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
you know if you can't get out

966
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,480
shelter put wherever you can and just

967
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,160
hold off until like

968
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,839
you know it's clear which

969
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
um basically on the outside though the

970
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,160
picture it's like there's this

971
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,280
massive swarm that were once where

972
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,480
they were at the uh the rally for trump

973
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,440
is now basically

974
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
right outside the capitol and they were

975
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,839
climbing up all over the place

976
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,359
trying to get in breaking through one

977
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,400
doe going through doors

978
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
um there one guy was

979
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,400
got a hold of a fire signature and threw

980
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,359
it at a

981
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,760
at a police officer i think near his

982
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,800
head like he had his right gear on

983
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,280
but then basically around the situation

984
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,880
three hours later after the you know

985
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,119
they've basically started getting into

986
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,720
the building that's with the sergeant

987
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
arms

988
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,480
who is basically the overall person in

989
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,760
charge of security

990
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,160
at the capitol to declare is it secure

991
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,920
now

992
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,720
does it catch 22 on that that basically

993
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,800
he met when security is like

994
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,280
we have all the congress secured either

995
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,839
they've been

996
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,520
relocated or we have enough uh

997
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,640
law enforcement in the building to hold

998
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,200
off

999
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,000
and even fend off further siege

1000
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,440
all right so now

1001
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
again it's like they're they're using

1002
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,160
this to talk to each other

1003
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,880
on these platforms so now you have

1004
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,200
now facebook twitter

1005
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,119
on instagram now or like okay

1006
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,599
we can't i'm not allow this anymore this

1007
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,040
this was

1008
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,160
this is not free speech anymore this is

1009
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,560
actual physical violence siege onto

1010
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,520
like property that you know it was they

1011
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,960
were not invited

1012
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
their bracelet they were breaking the

1013
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
law and they were using the platform to

1014
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,960
instigate it

1015
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,599
and show off

1016
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,720
so then you'll start seeing like

1017
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,240
the restricts more than ten thousand

1018
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,400
juan and militia groups um

1019
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,839
there the twitter starts rolling out the

1020
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,400
bands

1021
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
uh they they they start now not only

1022
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,760
start rolling out like they what they do

1023
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,800
is they reward at least like a temporary

1024
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,280
band

1025
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,200
they meet with immediate fat and then

1026
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
they will go into their policies and

1027
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,359
they will just go into and like rewrite

1028
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,440
them or of um

1029
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,720
to a point where they say okay in the

1030
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,599
event of

1031
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,200
today's activities we are

1032
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,640
here to revise the you know the policy

1033
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,920
about like free speech organization

1034
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,079
and

1035
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,359
so they now are starting to like roll

1036
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,040
actual bands

1037
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,560
people's accounts getting suspended

1038
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,839
and again it's like also like you see

1039
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,359
here

1040
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,680
more and more accounts more groups are

1041
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,440
now

1042
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,800
we're once talking to each other freely

1043
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,839
you know hosting events rallies

1044
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,520
um trains for for the groups for

1045
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
whatever

1046
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,440
they were no longer having that access

1047
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
now so now

1048
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,880
they're they're cut off from one another

1049
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,319
initially like right there it's like

1050
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,079
okay we can't talk to each other so we

1051
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:02,800
could use

1052
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,920
our phone attached email

1053
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,839
but that's a different essential

1054
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,319
platform but for social networking

1055
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,560
they're getting the news was coming

1056
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
around their neck basically onto

1057
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,040
how they were going to be able to not

1058
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,319
communicate with one another anymore

1059
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,040
and basically like how like they were

1060
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,440
saying

1061
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,640
like the like i was saying

1062
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,079
about the policy don't violations

1063
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,240
so again they they were like that that's

1064
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,359
it that's enough they're

1065
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,799
they're not tolerated anymore

1066
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,919
so

1067
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,520
we come to now where these the the list

1068
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,359
groups

1069
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,800
need to still talk to one another and

1070
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
they don't want to necessarily use

1071
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,920
facebook or

1072
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,079
because they can't use facebook or

1073
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,680
twitter but they still need to

1074
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
communicate

1075
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,200
at least on a social platform level

1076
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,599
right so

1077
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,760
in a sense they do a pivot and on a

1078
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
social media network level

1079
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,720
and they go to parlor um

1080
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,880
and so basically like how like parlor

1081
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,839
was

1082
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,000
by an initial analysis like how they

1083
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,880
were

1084
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
the michael blog slash networking so it

1085
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,800
was in a sense kind of like combining

1086
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,000
both twitter

1087
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,079
and facebook like you could do a short

1088
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,839
test and also do a short

1089
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,040
snip or a picture like what was going on

1090
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,160
um so basically

1091
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,359
like you have like journalists are

1092
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,520
saying it literally is an alternative

1093
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,599
to twitter and so what it is like okay

1094
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,359
so

1095
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,520
i can't go on twitter because i got

1096
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
banned they will try to create

1097
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,480
accounts right i like alternative

1098
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:52,880
accounts

1099
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,440
the problem is you need people you need

1100
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,119
to tell other people that you made an

1101
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,839
alternate account but by the time you

1102
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,599
start reaching out and get enough people

1103
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,960
to get the message out again you're

1104
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,240
already going to get blocked again so

1105
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,839
like that's why they went to a part of

1106
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,040
because again it was

1107
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,280
it was literally i guess one person

1108
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,960
described it as like the wild west the

1109
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,359
digital wild west

1110
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,480
um or very like you can literally talk

1111
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,040
about

1112
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,960
anything can you say anything and

1113
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
nine times out of ten you will not get

1114
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,480
even a warning on it

1115
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,560
and if you did it would have been

1116
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,079
something really

1117
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,040
bad for parlor overall but otherwise you

1118
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,079
would pretty much

1119
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,839
have free rings to talk about anything

1120
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
um

1121
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,880
and then of course into like how it says

1122
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,400
it's a unbiased

1123
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,839
social network that was both

1124
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,040
google and apple apple's app store

1125
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,520
and then when like politicians

1126
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,640
and other people who had

1127
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,079
a belief in what happened they

1128
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,119
they also decided like okay maybe i

1129
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,079
shouldn't be on

1130
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,599
twitter or on facebook because if

1131
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,640
they're willing to basically banned

1132
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,480
them from what they were talking about

1133
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,880
and then showing off what happened

1134
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,040
so then i just i could i should just

1135
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,800
migrate over

1136
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,599
so you see here like all these where i

1137
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,200
see confirmed people

1138
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,800
who were on parlor and have an account

1139
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,000
with them

1140
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,640
and you have like congress like a

1141
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,599
congressman right here

1142
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,880
a former ambassador

1143
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,680
governors but yet here they had to like

1144
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,000
as

1145
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,680
there was also news clippings and videos

1146
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
where they

1147
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,480
still had their official account on

1148
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,960
twitter on facebook

1149
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,839
but then they had like like an altered

1150
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,920
or like a secret account apart or where

1151
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,200
they could really

1152
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,960
show their feelings right so it's not

1153
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,640
like politically

1154
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,560
challenged or like viewed on the on the

1155
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,240
mainstream right so they could like they

1156
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,200
could like

1157
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,240
say how they really felt

1158
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,920
and then of course uh trump family

1159
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,880
and some of their members to join on

1160
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,480
there also because after especially what

1161
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,000
happened

1162
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,359
with the donald trump being banned

1163
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,119
they realized that okay well then why

1164
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,440
you know why why worry about why waiting

1165
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,800
to get banned

1166
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,079
ourselves so they went on the account

1167
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,319
now

1168
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,800
trump himself didn't necessarily have an

1169
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
account but what it is they found

1170
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,599
what i found out is his actual campaign

1171
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,480
created

1172
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,520
this parlor account so

1173
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,119
it wasn't trump per se but i'm

1174
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,079
but i'm fairly certain that he

1175
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,440
authorized this

1176
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,720
that's to have an account on there

1177
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,640
that could be indirectly tied to him

1178
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,319
at least he has some influence on it

1179
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,839
and then of course more people were also

1180
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,680
signed up for parlor too

1181
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,720
and these were like uh

1182
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,240
news anchors basically like they were

1183
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,839
on maybe not necessarily on the side

1184
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,040
of the militia groups

1185
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,200
but in their view is like what

1186
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,319
uh like facebook and twitter and

1187
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,119
instagram yeah

1188
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,400
basically like okay they banned them

1189
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
because what they're they're talking and

1190
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
this and then what they view was

1191
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,200
free speech so they said okay they

1192
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,680
either

1193
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,720
they cut ties with their original

1194
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,800
platform or they

1195
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,040
like drastically cut down on it and then

1196
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,480
they were over to

1197
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
parlor where they can actually have like

1198
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,079
less

1199
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,800
regulation you can say about what they

1200
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,720
want to say

1201
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,079
um and so like you had all these other

1202
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,119
people

1203
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,640
combinators tacos they they joined it

1204
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,839
but

1205
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,520
this this is where it gets into a gray

1206
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,400
area in in my opinion

1207
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,839
um so we have here now

1208
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,440
so parlor

1209
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,440
now starts to get really like high

1210
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,599
visibility of who's going over there

1211
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,599
to talk and they realize that it was

1212
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,880
basically

1213
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,240
people who either directly

1214
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,200
were in the siege or help organize it

1215
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,359
host it fund it whatever

1216
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,440
so google apple and

1217
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,880
start looking into their their

1218
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
policies about their apps and partner

1219
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
was as they're at on both their stores

1220
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,520
so they realize

1221
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,520
okay they need to

1222
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
enforce or moderate their app

1223
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,520
they like that you basically it's

1224
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,800
literally trying to tell

1225
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,119
literally google and apple are telling

1226
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,800
parlor you need to

1227
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,520
moderate what these people say so it

1228
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,760
says you're passing down

1229
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,839
in a sense they're passing out their

1230
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,599
policies of what is

1231
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,359
right and wrong onto their platform

1232
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,920
onto their app to say okay you need to

1233
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,000
enforce this right so

1234
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,160
having that said done already because

1235
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,680
they get rid of

1236
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,599
the them the the balls already started

1237
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,119
rolling with twitter

1238
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,920
because they banned trump because it was

1239
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,319
like

1240
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,920
a glass ceiling this is like who's going

1241
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,760
to do it first

1242
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,000
but then there was more energy behind it

1243
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,640
afterwards

1244
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,040
when that started rolling out so now

1245
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,640
like they're stepping outside okay

1246
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,839
yeah we're not going to tolerate this

1247
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,160
and the case in point amazon was like

1248
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,200
well

1249
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,760
they are potion their infrastructure on

1250
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,960
our

1251
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,599
on our systems and we know what they're

1252
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,200
doing what's what they're talking about

1253
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,800
maybe we shouldn't

1254
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,200
post them anymore right it's like

1255
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,119
so in a sense so like we don't want it

1256
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,440
it's like

1257
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
it's like the damage control like in the

1258
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,280
in their eyes like

1259
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,839
we don't want to be involved with them

1260
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,200
we're just going to

1261
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,000
cut ties with and then so you see here

1262
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,800
like how

1263
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,119
the at the time the ceo was saying like

1264
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,880
they're gonna be longer down than

1265
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
expected because

1266
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,839
you gotta realize they had

1267
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,640
a vast influx of people coming in

1268
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,880
to host like their talks their

1269
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,599
their ideas their beliefs and

1270
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,599
basically between they were they were

1271
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,200
really tracked

1272
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,760
they're trapped in between a digital

1273
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,520
rock and a digital hard place and they

1274
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,119
couldn't really get out because

1275
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,599
they were cornered by these three tech

1276
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:32,960
giants

1277
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,400
there was like they couldn't do anything

1278
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,440
about it so

1279
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,880
you see here it's like he's saying it's

1280
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,800
not due to software surgeons

1281
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,839
it's like their

1282
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,480
their pr you know telling the rest of

1283
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,839
the world like

1284
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,920
now we don't want to deal with them

1285
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,119
anymore

1286
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,200
they say bad things they do bad things

1287
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,240
they were associated with bad people

1288
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,200
they we warned them about doing

1289
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,720
moderation

1290
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,839
and like you need to establish like some

1291
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,119
guidelines of what's right what's wrong

1292
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,319
so and then basically right here like if

1293
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,319
you try to do a lookup

1294
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,240
at the time just right after they got

1295
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,559
cut off and their amazon

1296
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,000
it's like you couldn't reach them

1297
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,280
and then like this is like like from

1298
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,160
from apple's and google's standpoint

1299
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,040
about basically like in their in their

1300
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,520
view

1301
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,720
of parlor and they're basically they're

1302
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,759
saying that parlor

1303
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,000
either directly uh hosted the actual

1304
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,960
violence

1305
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,839
the day of or at the very least like

1306
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,839
instigated it to like or allow

1307
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,079
even like uh this um and a vector

1308
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,640
for allow them to escape from the other

1309
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,720
social media platforms

1310
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,480
so they can like essentially they can

1311
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,720
get away from the

1312
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,200
the digital law enforcement i guess or

1313
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,000
at least the

1314
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,319
corporation's version of it like where

1315
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,680
they can like don't worry about the

1316
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,480
guidelines

1317
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,359
being banned being suspended that's

1318
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,680
where they retreated to but then

1319
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,559
again it's like you see here like google

1320
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,920
and apple were like

1321
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,160
no we're not we're not we're not

1322
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,319
uh we're not going to be doing that

1323
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,559
we're we definitely do not want to be

1324
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,480
like like associated with them

1325
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,079
like they just cut they try to cut so

1326
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,520
many ties

1327
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,599
that i think they probably even skipped

1328
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,640
like a few

1329
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,400
few like legal like lego buying

1330
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,040
uh items like the contract say lately

1331
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,920
just in case

1332
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,240
parlor is um they're still

1333
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,040
being able to like they should have been

1334
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,319
able to be hosted by

1335
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,680
amazon but parlor is still

1336
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,599
suing them on it because they felt like

1337
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,280
they were basically

1338
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,160
kicked at a curve because that's what

1339
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,839
they believe

1340
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,079
so it turned it comes down to like what

1341
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,240
this company's belief versus partner

1342
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,799
and so they're like nope no more of it

1343
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,160
and so yeah so that's like again he's

1344
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,359
like

1345
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,320
um there's nothing we can do

1346
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,960
[Music]

1347
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,880
so it's like one of his final messages

1348
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,040
like so and essentially then referral

1349
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,200
for a little bit they were dark like if

1350
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,720
you go to

1351
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,559
their website they're trying to download

1352
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,240
the app

1353
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,359
the it wouldn't allow because both apple

1354
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,040
and google cut ties it they kicked it

1355
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,079
off

1356
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,190
and there was uh a

1357
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,799
[Music]

1358
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,359
i guess like some trolls i guess got

1359
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,240
noticed this

1360
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,520
and picked up on it and they were

1361
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,319
tricking at least iris on reddit

1362
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,680
they were tricking people of parlor like

1363
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,760
actual users they were saying like if

1364
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,200
you

1365
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,160
reinstall or uninstall the app and

1366
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,200
reinstall it it should work

1367
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,000
but then they realize that if they do it

1368
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,400
they

1369
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,079
can't reinstall it because the actual

1370
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,319
data the azure app that they took off

1371
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,839
their phone is no longer there and they

1372
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,520
can't recover it so if they try to pull

1373
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,720
it from

1374
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,760
the store to apple gold or apple or

1375
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,119
google store it's not there either

1376
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,079
so that was going on even too while that

1377
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,119
part was shut down

1378
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,799
so the people were getting trolled about

1379
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,040
that

1380
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,440
well okay so

1381
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,000
parlor for a time was trying to

1382
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,119
find people that can host

1383
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,880
at least try to get their infrastructure

1384
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,119
back up again

1385
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,319
and and during this time too

1386
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,760
people were like trying to distance

1387
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,359
themselves also because

1388
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,240
of maybe not necessarily what they

1389
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,799
thought

1390
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,520
or what they did in relation to the

1391
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,119
siege but it's more so about like

1392
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,839
if you do business with parlor

1393
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,440
then we or we as in like google or apple

1394
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,440
or amazon have no will either have a

1395
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,119
depreciated relationship or just stop

1396
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,920
our business entirely already and just

1397
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,200
implement some ethical clause and

1398
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,960
break the contract and stop services

1399
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,559
with said

1400
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,599
the provider because they wanted to help

1401
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,680
parlor

1402
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,520
so recently i was able to look up

1403
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,359
like they're doing this in this lookup

1404
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,040
and then see how they basically right

1405
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,000
now

1406
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,359
they're set up for this uh server

1407
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,240
they're talking somewhere in california

1408
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,479
now

1409
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,680
temporarily initially when they were

1410
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,599
dropped they were actually trying to re

1411
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,760
they went out to uh russia

1412
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,839
and for i do believe

1413
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,520
probably maybe a month they they were

1414
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,359
like a temporarily being hosted in

1415
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,040
russia

1416
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,480
by this group right here

1417
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,839
but eventually though they realized that

1418
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:28,480
they were

1419
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,920
they all term goal was trying to get

1420
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,720
back up again in the us

1421
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,000
so even though russia you know

1422
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,119
they made a deal with them

1423
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,480
they still ultimately don't want to come

1424
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,480
back to the us and then in which case

1425
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,359
they did

1426
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,280
they made a deal with this company

1427
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,359
so they're now trying to get it back up

1428
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,680
but

1429
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,160
from from from looking at their website

1430
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,359
they're they're really kind of

1431
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,960
like basically just barely up and

1432
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,680
running but

1433
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,960
it's not functional and i do believe

1434
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,000
they don't have an app yet supported

1435
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,400
still not by apple or google so

1436
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,720
and also too that's a very interesting

1437
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,839
too

1438
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,520
with parlor when you went to do

1439
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,559
a user

1440
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,599
snap as a user they required a

1441
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,640
driver's license and i thought like

1442
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,079
okay for a new user

1443
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,079
that seemed like to me like a like a

1444
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,079
interesting honeypot if they were to do

1445
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,040
like something like that

1446
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,480
just gather all that pii just to sign up

1447
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,880
right and

1448
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,440
i i personally thought like okay maybe

1449
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
parlor was

1450
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,079
in a way like somewhat like

1451
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,839
in like in league with the law

1452
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,480
enforcement like okay we can see

1453
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,799
who people are talking about and and

1454
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,720
like you gather the intel

1455
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,920
about what they're talking about and

1456
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,280
what they get what would they possibly

1457
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,559
be doing

1458
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,680
so to to launch an investigation on

1459
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,000
so it's person or persons right

1460
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,559
but ultimately though they they they are

1461
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,280
getting

1462
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,400
may back up but it's

1463
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,920
it's basically they're still kind of

1464
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,599
crippled though because they didn't have

1465
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,359
that once

1466
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,559
infrastructure like they had uh prior to

1467
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,760
january 6. so they

1468
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,240
they were significantly downscaled

1469
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,640
and i wouldn't be surprised if they were

1470
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,520
trying to run

1471
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,720
harder right now out of like maybe a

1472
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,160
uh either a large garage

1473
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,799
or a couple offices but that's it

1474
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,760
they're they're

1475
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,119
they're that hindered down that bad

1476
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,400
so after all that said and done with

1477
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,359
parlor

1478
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,720
as an example it's really

1479
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,839
it's now we need to ask each other

1480
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,200
or ask ourselves like

1481
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,160
you know what what is you know what is

1482
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,880
your thought what is your opinion

1483
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,400
right because i can't tell you

1484
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,359
for everyone of what parlor did was

1485
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,319
right or wrong

1486
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,680
i can only go as far as me

1487
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,440
um because it literally was using

1488
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,880
it's it's saying free same one thing

1489
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,640
versus doing something in in relation to

1490
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,279
what they said

1491
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:43,200
because like you know we're

1492
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,280
we're saying like if i you know if

1493
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,680
if if i say something bad about a person

1494
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,760
you know is it still protected as free

1495
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,680
speech

1496
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,960
and okay so but if i say the set

1497
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,640
same thing on social media

1498
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,079
like twitter facebook is it still going

1499
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,280
to be just

1500
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,160
protected the same way or is it going to

1501
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,720
be

1502
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,000
like okay well maybe not because

1503
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,160
they may have stricter guidelines or

1504
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,839
policies saying no you can't say that

1505
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,200
period

1506
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,240
because they are a private entity that

1507
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,960
is

1508
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,359
you know allowing people to say what

1509
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:28,480
they want but

1510
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,559
if you put it on their network then they

1511
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,400
have they're saying they have a say of

1512
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,359
what is allowed

1513
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,279
on their platform

1514
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,520
um so and then and then also too it's

1515
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,440
like

1516
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,839
can we learn from this from like not

1517
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,240
happening because

1518
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,839
you know trump you know recently got

1519
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,280
accorded again for the second

1520
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,400
you know impeachment but

1521
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,920
this is like the first time like ever in

1522
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,079
my knowledge

1523
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,520
that you know the capital was actually

1524
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
direct seeds like and then just

1525
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,480
not only like not just like the outer

1526
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,760
perimeter

1527
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,359
but the full briefs like inside

1528
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,319
they were communicating that well and

1529
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,039
even though

1530
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,839
they were splintered into that way but

1531
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,039
still we have that communication

1532
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,160
platform and they were

1533
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,000
using these platforms but

1534
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,559
at the same time it's like okay where

1535
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,039
how do we

1536
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,480
how do we prevent something like this

1537
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,760
happening again to say like

1538
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,880
um i don't like the white house or the

1539
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,440
supreme court or not even at the federal

1540
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,720
like just state levels

1541
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,480
like all like these other buildings like

1542
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,160
what happened not while

1543
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,359
i fought back with um like seattle and

1544
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,839
portland they just

1545
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,799
took over a a town or a block of the

1546
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:55,920
city

1547
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,160
and basically they you know quote

1548
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,920
unquote annexed it and made their own

1549
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,599
rules

1550
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,039
you know it it's and again it's just

1551
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,880
they're using these social platforms and

1552
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,599
then like we need to like say like okay

1553
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,559
where is the line between you know free

1554
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,160

1556
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,240
