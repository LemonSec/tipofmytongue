1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,720
this conference will now be recorded

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
all right uh for the purpose of this

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,240
recording my name is rod soto i'm here

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,720
with

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
chris uh we both belong to hack miami

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,079
and today we're going to talk about

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,240
dangers of unregulated supply chain

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
this is something that we decided to

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,320
research on due to recent events

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
mainly the the solar winds campaign

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
which in my opinion was a devastating

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
attack

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
uh that compromised around 18 000

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,640
customers from that company

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
uh is unknown the amount of collateral

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
damage

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
the amount of information that was

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
exfiltrated

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,399
uh and the future consequences

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
of what happened after this campaign

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,640
i am going to say it i am not an expert

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,879
on this this is something that we do at

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,079
miami we we try to teach ourselves new

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,480
things

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,600
and research on new topics um and this

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
is how we learn and um

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,479
as bumpy or as uh

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,280
trial by error that it can be it's it's

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,439
it's the way we advance is the way

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,640
we look at new things um and uh

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
obviously our interests um

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
peaked after this whole

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
solo win campaigns

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
and i'm going to let chris introduce

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,600
himself

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
hi everyone i'm chris but i'm known as

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,200
blue flots of

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
miami and uh basically it was

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
right here first amy introduced me to

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
like the rest of the

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
miami wave just decided to go down and

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,759
see half miami

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,399
for myself for the first time for like i

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,280
think it was

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,159
what what year was that bro like back in

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,360
2019

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
i think he was two three actually three

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,159
four years ago right

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
yeah yeah i just was down there at the

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
beach and i was like hey

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,760
uh i heard about miami here's the tent

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
got the cool badge he was like

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
but it's a friday so i i knew that was

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
training for rod so i was like

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,760
all right so what i do well why don't

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,599
you go upstairs there's a guy named rod

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
soda up there he's teaching the class

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
okay

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
and that's where he met and so uh

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
basically uh currently what i do right

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
now is an incident responder

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,239
uh with uh after my technologies i've

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,280
been there for

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,319
almost two years and then previously

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,800
i've got experience with the army and

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
security applications

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,080
and then the other contractor um

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
but i think what's relevant though in

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,319
this particularly talked over me is

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
i worked with a small company

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,920
and they actually utilized solarwinds

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,200
so i know this firsthand because

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,720
actually one of my jobs in the time

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
frame while i was working with this

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
company is that basically i handled

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,519
solar wind so i was interacting with

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,519
one of the set customers that rob was

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,519
talking about but

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,360
when i go in to talk to it you realize

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
that it was more than just

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
like customers like customers of

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
customers and it's just a domino effect

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,640
so

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,519
um it's uh it's a little doozy so

85
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,239
back to you rod

86
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
awesome so i'm hoping that you can

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,840
provide today

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
some of your personal experience i used

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
solarwinds in the past

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
i've never been in a position to be

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
on mssp level but i

92
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
i know then they actually have the

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,920
products actually to be honest they have

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,879
some

95
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
some uh some applications that are very

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,560
useful

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
and that i used before in my life of

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,159
system administrator

99
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
actually um so let's go ahead and um

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,560
let me share this again i want to make

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
sure that all of you understand that we

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,319
we're not experts at this this is a way

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,400
for us to get started

104
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
on this subject because um

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,839
when i i started looking at this um

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,280
there was really not much of

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,560
um particularly

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
in things that you can um sort of a

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,199
apply or or even with colleagues

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,080
so it looks like the many times this is

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,479
um

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
sort of a specific to certain scenarios

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
and size of companies

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,639
um i after later

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
after i learned that that this can

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,080
actually affect

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
uh small companies as well uh so i was i

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
was not really an expert on this

119
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
and i i try to basically do do this

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
research in order to

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
bring myself up onto uh what things

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
we as defenders need to look at

123
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,160
when we are in um approaching

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,440
uh the the risks of uh supply chain

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
management so uh

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
let me um i'm gonna start with uh

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,800
can you see this right um chris is it

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,440
okay

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
he said okay good so you already heard

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,600
from us

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,440
uh i co-founded uh miami pacific hackers

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
chris is a member of

133
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,280
hack miami he's a incident responder and

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
a security researcher as well

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
he started with us two or three years

136
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,639
ago

137
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,360
and chris is another example in a

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
success story of what you can be

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
he came from the armed forces i was

140
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,039
trying to break into cyber security

141
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
and uh coming to our meetings kept

142
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
participating in ctfs

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,199
um learning himself about

144
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
uh many things that we discussed in in

145
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,360
our meetings

146
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,880
and and documents and information we

147
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
share and eventually

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
uh we were able to uh uh help him uh

149
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,039
uh transition

150
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,199
into infosec and now he's full-time so

151
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,319
here uh what is uh supply chain

152
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,280
management so

153
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,719
i i took a generic

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
definition of supply chain management uh

155
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,800
this one specifically

156
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
uh says that supply chain management

157
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,720
is uh the process uh inactivity of

158
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
sourcing the raw materials

159
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
or components an enterprise needs

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,039
to create a product or service and

161
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
deliver that product or service to

162
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
customers

163
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
um by the nature of this definition

164
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
um basically it looks to me

165
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,560
like in a sort of an ecosystem where a

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
company grabs

167
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
stuff from other parties essentially

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
third bodies

169
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,720
in order to put it together and

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
eventually deliver it to a customer

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,240
and we will see that in

172
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,199
the next slides uh how this uh actually

173
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,400
represents

174
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,319
uh an entire um attack surface

175
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
uh that can be uh affected that can be

176
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
tampered with and that can affect the

177
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
bottom line which is

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,680
your perimeter or even your product so

179
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,039
here's some of the uh

180
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
the attacks that i was able to

181
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,639
research on uh supply chain management

182
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,840
um basically i took this from

183
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,440
mitre which is the the the government

184
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,960
um entity that basically produces the

185
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
nomenclature

186
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,319
or most of what we actually consume an

187
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,560
infosec like miter attack

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,479
or cves or kpec um

189
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,919
so basically there are uh four types of

190
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,879
attacks

191
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
that involve supply chain

192
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
management malicious insertion of

193
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,280
hardware

194
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,759
malicious insertion of software

195
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
malicious insertion

196
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
firmware and malicious insertion of a

197
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
system

198
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
information slash data so

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
uh we're gonna take a look at uh

200
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,958
all this uh during this presentation

201
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
but you already can probably tell how

202
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
this type of attacks are

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
and we're gonna look at them uh in a

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,919
little more detail

205
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,519
so here's a a a

206
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,360
um before we get into the

207
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,560
the the specifics of the attacks

208
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
um in historical uh perspective of the

209
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
supply and change management campaigns

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,120
and we have one that just happened

211
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
uh we have one in 2015 that involved

212
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
juniper networks

213
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519
where where basically uh there was some

214
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,399
sort of a

215
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,160
exploitation via um

216
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
by the use of bypass authentication and

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
code was uh change

218
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,760
you also have another campaign 2015

219
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,080
called

220
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
xcode ghost which

221
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,399
targeted ios developers by uh

222
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
sending them a fake xcode version

223
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,399
uh if you're aware xcode is usually a

224
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,440
framework

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
that um apple uh developers use

226
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,399
um in 2017 we had the not pedia

227
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,160
basically targeted a accounting software

228
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,120
provider

229
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
which in that case was me doc

230
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
and actually i did a little bit of

231
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,279
research on this

232
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
campaign and this campaign was pretty

233
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
interesting because

234
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,959
um my suspicious as of today

235
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,680
is that during not petty there were

236
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
several payloads

237
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,680
uh some of them look like actual

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
ransomware

239
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
but the ones that were directed to the

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
actual target

241
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
which was uh many of the government

242
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,079
organizations including

243
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,120
including utilities in in

244
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,839
the targeted country um were destructive

245
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
and one of the things that i think they

246
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
did is actually

247
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,200
they released one of this looks like

248
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
standard ransomware samples

249
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,880
to the community so then it was sort of

250
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,360
a

251
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
this was an amazing campaign by the way

252
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
um

253
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
uh it's it's in again these are my

254
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,279
suspicions i don't i don't have

255
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,200
obviously i don't have proof to

256
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
to say this is exactly what happened but

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
i was actually monitoring as it was

258
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
happening and

259
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
i do remember um that

260
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
all of a sudden there were some security

261
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
companies saying hey we got a sample in

262
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,200
alpentia and it's simply a standard

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,000
ransomware

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
as this was happening the target was

265
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,399
actually receiving

266
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
uh the actual destructive of petya

267
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,760
which was uh i think has sort of a wiper

268
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,079
payload so this was very interesting

269
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,240
because the way they did it it was

270
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
um it was it was pretty clever it was it

271
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,040
was a way of of

272
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
basically distracting the public opinion

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
misdirecting

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
you know even the perception saying ah

275
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,959
this is just then the ransomware but in

276
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,320
reality

277
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
the the the targeted um

278
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
victims which uh would deliver

279
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
this payload because they were using a

280
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
third uh

281
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
party uh software called me doc which is

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,320
uh the

283
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
accounting software the their payload

284
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
was disrupted

285
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,920
we also have a uh another example in

286
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,959
2017

287
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,120
fluxiv um fluxiv actually target

288
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
uh the crab cleaner tool uh you

289
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
i'm sure many of you are familiar with

290
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,519
uh

291
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
crab cleaner i use crap cleaner all the

292
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
time during my life of

293
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
a system administrator in fact however

294
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,880
always download craft cleaner because

295
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,720
crab cleaner will clean your registry

296
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
will clean all the crap that you have

297
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,959
like um

298
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
temporary files um things that other

299
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
programs left in the system uh if you

300
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
use them but you don't use it anymore

301
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
on the stalin and the owners dollars

302
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
usually on installers are

303
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,760
very um some of some honest dollars

304
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,279
are very messy and they leave a lot of

305
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
stuff inside the systems

306
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
so dude the way to go scrap cleaner but

307
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,160
guess what

308
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,839
they they went and this actor

309
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
went in um targeted

310
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
the crab cleaner tool knowing that many

311
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
people downloaded it

312
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
and use it including i actually read it

313
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
some of the russian apds were actually

314
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,639
using crack cleaner themselves

315
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,720
to clean after themselves well guess

316
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,680
what

317
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
if they had downloaded it that time they

318
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
would have been compromised themselves

319
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
oh it would have given away

320
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,760
uh the the actual host that they were

321
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
compromising

322
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
and of course now we have the 220

323
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,959
solarwinds

324
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,440
right 18 000 customers affected

325
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
including

326
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
many government agencies uh it is my

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,480
opinion that this was a

328
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
catastrophic disastrous campaign um

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,399
and i'm gonna let chris in a minute give

330
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,760
his point of view

331
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,040
uh because um we

332
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
in my opinion are going to say this is a

333
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,399
personal opinion we were lucky

334
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,720
and we were lucky because this seems to

335
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,760
be mostly

336
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
uh espionage but this would have been an

337
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,360
actor

338
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,399
that wanted to basically be absolutely

339
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,079
malicious and destructive

340
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,000
this would have been catastrophic not

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,680
only for all of us for our country in

342
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,480
general

343
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
um i steam uh the result and the effects

344
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,279
of

345
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
of of campaigns like the ones against

346
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,560
saudi aranco where they wiped 30 000

347
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,839
uh servers um i seen what can happen

348
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
uh in in terms of real life we just saw

349
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
a little example of it

350
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,720
with colonial pipeline um this type of

351
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
attacks are

352
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,040
in nature destructive um they

353
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,760
they really really can cause real life

354
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,639
effects

355
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,040
uh and we're lucky that in the cases all

356
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,079
wins there was no

357
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
destructive payload that we know of as

358
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,600
somehow

359
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
uh deployed and it looks like it was

360
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,800
mostly uh espionage that's what that's

361
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,160
my knowledge until now uh maybe we will

362
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,199
find out

363
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,079
later on that there is other types of

364
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,120
payloads that may

365
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
have been left in um i don't doubt that

366
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
could be the case

367
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,120
but i'm gonna say it again we were very

368
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
lucky because if

369
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
this individuals instead of of of

370
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,800
doing espionage would have been um

371
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
driven by destroying the systems we all

372
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,480
of us

373
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
we would have been in huge struggle and

374
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
then before i let

375
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,279
chris talked a little bit about it uh we

376
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,880
just have another campaign

377
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
which is also uh of supply chain

378
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
uh nature which is um

379
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,480
this novellian group which apparently is

380
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
fraud russian origin or is said to be

381
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,600
russian origin which uh basically

382
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,560
compromise

383
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,680
constant contact and constant contact is

384
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,759
a provider of email communications email

385
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,040
marketing and then

386
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
by compromising a uh one account i

387
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
believe was usa

388
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,079
they started to fish

389
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,480
or target uh state department

390
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,360
individuals

391
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
uh basically trying to find out

392
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
information about uh

393
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
related of um the

394
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
soon-to-be happening uh uh meeting

395
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,759
between

396
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,320
uh president joe biden and vladimir

397
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
putin

398
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279
so this is another example of uh of

399
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,639
the importance and the the effects of

400
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
supply chain management campaigns so

401
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
chris you wanna you wanna give us your a

402
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
little bit of your take on the

403
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
of the soil winds

404
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,519
yeah i sure can um

405
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
see uh can you go to the next slide

406
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,839
yeah okay

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
uh so basically

408
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,639
in before i

409
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,440
joined after my i was working for a

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,079
vendor

411
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,520
down in remotely though i could say but

412
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
uh this vendor was primarily located in

413
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,359
fort lauderdale

414
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,799
and my job there at the time was

415
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,760
basically just like

416
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
you know basic i.t support that's all it

417
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,919
was really and then the occasional

418
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,559
looking

419
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
at the being the system admin making

420
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,679
sure you know

421
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,599
uh computers were patched and such

422
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
now uh what that i never hated then

423
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
before this i've never handled

424
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
solarwinds before never touched it

425
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,640
didn't really see

426
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,559
much of it when i was in the army or in

427
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,039
the

428
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,720
dod contracting but when i started to

429
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
interact with it more and more i was

430
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,880
like

431
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
okay yeah this is kind of like a like a

432
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,480
real

433
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,280
hyped up version of at least in my in my

434
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,160
view it's like a

435
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,880
hyped up version of remote desktop so in

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,320
the case it's like you know you have the

437
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,120
vendor

438
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,720
handling this client which this client

439
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
by the way was located

440
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400
mainly in palm beach

441
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
however they had an office in maine also

442
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,080
an office

443
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,200
in portland now

444
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,320
once i get more and more into it i

445
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,480
realized that uh this was

446
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,080
more sense and more like

447
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,200
you know in revealing on to

448
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
the client itself and we were helping

449
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
with this client which basically

450
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,880
is an it support right

451
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,679
um so like in this case like in like in

452
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
this slide right here it's like

453
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
like with the csa issuing the bullets

454
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
and it was full of wins but

455
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,160
but beforehand before this bulletin

456
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
there really was not much use and it was

457
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
like what ross said it was widely

458
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,919
distributed among agencies

459
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,960
and other private sectors too it was a

460
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,840
means of like

461
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,440
okay it's simple it's

462
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,480
pretty well built together um and

463
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,799
and let me see if i can share this or at

464
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,360
least put it in the chat

465
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,240
they also had a

466
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
disability here too i'm going to put it

467
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
in the chat

468
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,600
to enable 2fa 2 factor authentication

469
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,559
so the way it works is in this in this

470
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
promoting in

471
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,880
i'm here and say near tampa and the

472
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,799
clients in

473
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,840
like fort lauderdale and like you know

474
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
we were chatting in real time and i

475
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,000
could

476
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,240
actually call them too but the chat was

477
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,679
actually faster

478
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,600
and then they had the issue like hey i'm

479
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
having problems okay

480
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
and then i remote in

481
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
um now with solo wins

482
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,720
this was more about the the controller

483
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
was more on my endless on the client

484
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,000
because what it took is basically you

485
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,559
once you had your workstation set up

486
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,840
then you just had to like install maybe

487
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,559
two or three programs really on their

488
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,280
end

489
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,240
and then basically what is it didn't

490
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,960
really exactly

491
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,000
leave it open to remoting

492
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,520
in but it was fairly easy to be honest

493
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,960
so it's just to be able to run it and

494
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
then when i say remote in

495
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,559
if their computer was um

496
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,000
it didn't really like give the prompts

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
like oh hey by the way you know

498
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,679
such here i actually have to let them

499
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,960
know

500
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
ahead of time that you know this is me

501
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,760
i'm on solo wins and i'm coming in to

502
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,280
look into your computer and

503
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,520
they they they had the capability and

504
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,840
this

505
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,679
this is this is like red tape

506
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,600
but basically at the time when i was

507
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
working with this vendor

508
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
interacting with this client they did

509
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,320
not i'll say this again they did not

510
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
have two-factor authentication enabled

511
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,400
but if it was enabled what it is is that

512
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,880
when

513
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,559
i remote in client has to give me the

514
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,200
code

515
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
in order to let me complete the login

516
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
otherwise it would to stop it right then

517
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,559
there

518
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,960
but again at the time when i was doing

519
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,240
my job

520
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,520
it was not enabled can it be enabled yes

521
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
it can be you just reading the

522
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
documentation on it

523
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,200
so uh can you go to the next slide

524
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
okay um let me see can you make that

525
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
bigger

526
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,520
i know it's a little it's a little hard

527
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,039
to see

528
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
um but it will explain it else

529
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,440
i'll go on more of the details about it

530
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,480
all right so this was basically my main

531
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,919
screen right here whenever

532
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,520
uh when i was basically the an admin for

533
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,960
this

534
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,679
so what you see here on the left on the

535
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,039
on the left side of it it's like you

536
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
have all these other

537
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,240
um like users

538
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,400
in itself like even workstations

539
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
identified that have been

540
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,360
either either currently active

541
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
or not active using the solarwinds

542
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,679
remote monitoring and then in the

543
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,360
the top center is when you actually are

544
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,240
interfacing

545
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,559
with the the workstations and servers

546
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,600
i might add of the client so

547
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,120
say that this client had a terminal

548
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,159
that was having issues well

549
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,000
i would still still be able to move it

550
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
in just as easily

551
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
just basically by right clicking and

552
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,280
just enable

553
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
remote desktop that's basically what it

554
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,559
was and

555
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,720
it went straight to it as long as the

556
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
computer was on but

557
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,360
there was a caveat to that that

558
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
with this software that you're seeing in

559
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
front of you can enable

560
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,360
like remote code execution on this

561
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
not just like you know just like

562
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,240
promoting in like a remote desktop but

563
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,520
like you can actually do a lot of stuff

564
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,159
a lot of opportunities a lot of vectors

565
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,320
you can do with this

566
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
and then what you see right there too

567
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,720
also is like the status of that said

568
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,799
workstation or even like if you look on

569
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,200
the task too like it shows like servers

570
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
workstations

571
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
so again i can interact with the the

572
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
server too

573
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
and i could put and then like what the

574
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
rob was saying like you could enable

575
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,480
like malicious

576
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
software and like people i can install a

577
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,760
key locker on their font

578
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
and get their credentials because even

579
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,760
though it was the solo win

580
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,600
they still use microsoft 365

581
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,279
but that they didn't still go get

582
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,240
the credentials for it just by removing

583
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,200
this remote code

584
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
execution um but what i found

585
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,760
what was immediately disturbing what

586
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,279
this uh client would had

587
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,720
was they were not trying to reveal too

588
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,159
much detail about it um

589
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
they were into travel so

590
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,559
they handled like

591
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
domestic international travel and we're

592
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
talking about

593
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,360
passports we're talking about

594
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,440
health forms vaccinations

595
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
financial statements accounts i mean

596
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,600
when i was able to walk in i like i had

597
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,120
true visibility of it so

598
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,240
even me working you know legit

599
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,159
like being able to walk into this if

600
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,360
they if they if an actor you know

601
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,520
a uh a a bad actor was able to get a

602
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
access to in which they did

603
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
they they immediately could have had

604
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,720
access

605
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
to all this so it's like in

606
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,679
in the triangle hierarchy it's reversed

607
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,440
so that once you get access to that

608
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,039
client

609
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,279
that customer then you just immediately

610
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,159
got access to

611
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
their clients workstations computers and

612
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,200
then

613
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,720
beyond that their financial statements

614
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,039
their phi the pii it

615
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,279
and then even then in the software too

616
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,039
you can right click and you can see like

617
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,080
what status

618
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,039
of their like if they were due for

619
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,840
updates

620
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
you can roll back an update too

621
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,600
so it it really was a lot of control and

622
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
it was a lot of

623
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
easy uh manipulation to the point like

624
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,559
what rod saying like

625
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,600
you can put inject malicious software in

626
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,799
here

627
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,559
you can easily mail something to them

628
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,000
and say hey this is

629
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
the part of the computer just look it up

630
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,080
hook it up to computer

631
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,159
done they could easily put like a

632
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,840
hardware version of a beacon on there

633
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
and just go in anytime

634
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,480
so right the uh the this specific also

635
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:04,960
the

636
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,000
one they uh the seller went even

637
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,080
uh more difficult to detect based on the

638
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,120
information i have

639
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,000
is that uh they were they first

640
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,039
compromised

641
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,000
uh saul wins itself and then they were

642
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,799
able to

643
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
basically uh either steal the

644
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,320
certificate

645
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
or add malicious code to the updates and

646
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,679
this is

647
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
in response to a question in the chat

648
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,080
that says

649
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,000
uh even if you're able to validate the

650
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,440
certificate

651
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
with the uh backdoor or whatever

652
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
malicious payload work the answer is yes

653
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
and this is exactly what happened here

654
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,880
uh if if if i am able to compromise

655
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
uh solarwinds for example and

656
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,400
already have access to their updates

657
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
and i am myself as a malicious actor

658
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
embedding code they're not checking the

659
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,919
code but they're signing it

660
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,039
and then delivering to their customers

661
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,240
the answers yes

662
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,320
you will you won't be able to even

663
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,559
detect this because if you actually look

664
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,000
at the signature the signature will be

665
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,799
valid

666
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,960
and i actually saw uh some other stuff

667
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,919
that microsoft did

668
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,279
very interesting by the way they were

669
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,039
comparing uh uh

670
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,720
lines of code and that's how they were

671
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
able to discover it but it's incredibly

672
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
hard and difficult

673
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,159
that's why supply chain management

674
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,919
attacks are

675
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,720
uh uh are very difficult to defend

676
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
against because

677
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,000
we will see soon you depend on

678
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
things that you can't control and

679
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,240
uh very good chris was able to to

680
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,679
to tell you firsthand how powerful

681
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,159
specifically this tool was and this is

682
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,039
not just

683
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,159
one there's many others uh we had seen

684
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,440
uh campaigns that um involve other

685
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
software like teamviewer for example

686
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,039
and there there are many others it

687
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,720
doesn't just need to be

688
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,360
yeah so the thing about solarwinds this

689
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,399
old wing was

690
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,159
was good reputation and it had uh

691
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,200
an incredible amount of um

692
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,559
government uh clients

693
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,679
i myself would use it i i i was i was

694
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,000
actually

695
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,039
surprised uh when i heard that they were

696
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,880
compromising because i have used always

697
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,760
in the past

698
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,039
not just the the the agent but uh all

699
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,240
their tools that they have they're

700
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
actually pretty good

701
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,840
so uh this is actually very telling

702
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,320
and the adversaries are now looking at

703
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,640
sources that we trust because obviously

704
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,919
other ways are harder to go through

705
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,520
and we will see that in as we move on on

706
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
this something else you want to say

707
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,919
about this

708
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,760
before we move on or are we ready to

709
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,399
move on on this

710
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,840
yeah um it just basically like if you

711
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,440
still utilize this um

712
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,640
even even what after what's happened um

713
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,279
i would highly highly recommend that you

714
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,000
push this

715
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,919
enable two-factor authentication because

716
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,200
at the very least

717
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,679
if if they still get malicious coded and

718
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,720
injected and back

719
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
into it and then try to push it that's

720
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,399
one thing but if they

721
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,120
if you still put this 2fa inside

722
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
solarwinds enabled

723
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,760
at least gives the client some type of a

724
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,360
barrier or defense

725
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,960
that prevents them from getting inside

726
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,399
the actual workstations or

727
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
servers

728
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,559
good point so um

729
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,320
actually you know what you can actually

730
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
go on this one this one is

731
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,480
actually if you want to go on this one

732
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,840
uh yeah so basically like okay so

733
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,039
i believe it was fire i

734
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
might if i might get my correct right

735
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,559
about when they first detected

736
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,600
the issue yeah yeah

737
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,799
so they were like they they

738
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,720
they must have saw they saw something

739
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,480
initially and they didn't quite right so

740
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,440
they looked into

741
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
like what rob was talking about the code

742
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,120
like wait that's not right

743
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
it's a legit sir but it's somehow it's

744
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,000
it it's malicious but then

745
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
all sudden it was like a i don't feel

746
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,559
like a lack of a better term it's like a

747
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,279
wildfire in california just spread

748
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,200
and they realize like oh wow they got

749
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,320
into like

750
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,240
the the um the update server of it for

751
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
solarwinds it's like oh man

752
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,039
and it went everywhere so

753
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,399
it's it it it's it's

754
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
uh it's amazing like how if you get to

755
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,159
the source of it and then you just are

756
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,679
able to do

757
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,559
that um interaction with it and then

758
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,080
being able to get inside of it

759
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,159
and then be able to just go anywhere and

760
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,080
then like the like the timeline here

761
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,279
it's like

762
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,320
but it goes back here like

763
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,080
uh september night uh 2019.

764
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,600
it's like okay we know something was

765
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,080
going on but then you know

766
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
with and then of course two a little bit

767
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,840
later to start doing the test code

768
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,158
uh the test and then with the ejection

769
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,679
and then they like okay so so far so

770
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,120
good

771
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
nothing nothing really you know like

772
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
stands out unless it's getting red flats

773
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,640
it's like okay

774
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,279
the next step so we start deploying it

775
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,799
so it's kind of in the cyber kill change

776
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,000
like okay

777
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
you know constants looks good weaponize

778
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,760
it

779
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,159
deploy it and you know just start

780
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,519
pivoting on it

781
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,919
and then it's like you right here like

782
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,880
you see like

783
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,720
in 2020 or february 2020

784
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
it's like a sunburst which is the actual

785
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,760
vulnerability

786
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,600
with our orion and the solarwinds so

787
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,360
it it's it was kind of officially hard

788
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,480
to detect because

789
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,440
again it's like you're using a trusted

790
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,799
software

791
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,360
it it's like trusted like microsoft word

792
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
or early in the office like okay so

793
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,360
why you should have a problem with it so

794
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,120
that's the problem with this

795
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,720
it was so in deep of it and then like

796
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,000
how like they try to do

797
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,279
the hot fixes on it um

798
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,320
they try to move the malware and then

799
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,880
back to like december 2020

800
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,559
and i think that's about i think that's

801
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,480
about right um

802
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,240
this one's like noticing about it maybe

803
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,000
again what you just said actually it's

804
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,519
pretty telling uh how

805
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,760
how you react to this i mean you have to

806
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,799
invalidate the cert

807
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,240
that's the first probably the first

808
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
thing you need to do and then you have

809
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
to uninstall whatever you had installed

810
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,399
but the problem is

811
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,399
how far in depth they went

812
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,159
and that is very telling when you look

813
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,159
at

814
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,200
this sequence of events because it's

815
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
malicious insertion like what we what we

816
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,480
look at first

817
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,200
they they did malaysian's insertion of

818
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,240
software

819
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,559
in a trusted entity the trusted entity

820
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,000
was uh

821
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,120
solar winds uh so we would look at it in

822
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,159
a minute um

823
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,720
as far as how can we defend how this

824
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,440
attacks that

825
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,080
actually there's an entire catalog by

826
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
the way

827
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,519
of how this attack are divided

828
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,200
so let me actually move this forward

829
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,799
and this is something you can actually

830
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,960
help me uh as well

831
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,679
uh we would like to let you know as well

832
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,159
that

833
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
uh there are certain contextual

834
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,120
items that not necessarily um

835
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,799
formally of a supply chain but that will

836
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,679
affect you and that will affect uh your

837
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,640
attack surface

838
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
some of those things are the commercial

839
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,840
off the shell

840
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,760
hardware um and software

841
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,080
like for example yeah you have all your

842
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,840
stuff tied together

843
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
but you decide to buy for example a

844
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
router that has a back door

845
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,760
right that you want to bought and best

846
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,399
buy and this router

847
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,879
has a backdoor because it's manufactured

848
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,679
in

849
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,119
an adversary an adversarial a country

850
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,399
and now you are compromised um so that's

851
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,520
that's a simple example uh

852
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,879
i'm not sure if you remember one time

853
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,960
there was a lot of rumor uh there was a

854
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,760
rumor about

855
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,040
a certain server manufacturer which

856
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,918
uh uh supposedly had been implanted this

857
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,359
malicious insertion of

858
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,040
hardware right uh was implanted for some

859
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,239
ship that was calling back a uh

860
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,040
a another country or you can actually

861
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,800
modify the firmware that's malicious

862
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,440
insertion

863
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,800
of firmware uh for example uh

864
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,399
you find out that one of your

865
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
adversaries is buying

866
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,359
a type of server or

867
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,918
a type of device the device is

868
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,879
intersected

869
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,680
and then the component malicious

870
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,520
component is inserted that's a way to

871
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,000
perform

872
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,520
a supply chain attack um also you have

873
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,200
to take a look at things such as open

874
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
source components open source components

875
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,839
can be targeted and that's that's been

876
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,119
seen uh uh

877
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,440
in recent history how if you like for

878
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
example php was targeted

879
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,920
uh for backdoors for example uh so

880
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,560
that's a way

881
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,880
of uh basically you attack the component

882
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
the component is being used

883
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,920
at the victim and now victim updates or

884
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,599
downloads that component and you're able

885
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,000
to get to the big thing

886
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,119
there are other stuff that you also need

887
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,680
to take a look at like rogue insiders

888
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,200
foreign components and we will see that

889
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,599
at the end how to address them

890
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,000
third-party applications

891
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,359
which may or may not be of your formal

892
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,720
supply chain

893
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,440
um and temporary personal circumtractors

894
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,119
rod can i say something about the

895
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,560
third-party application

896
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,839
yeah um so what the

897
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,440
vendor i was working with and handling

898
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,079
the customer and like

899
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,800
what we did we also we set up a

900
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,079
basically a business

901
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
office 360 with this customer

902
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,040
and that was another

903
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,359
i guess another domino of that being

904
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,720
able getting

905
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,119
solarwinds breached so that when you

906
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,480
interacted with

907
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,040
the client like workstations you also

908
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,880
had visibility

909
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,160
of their office account too

910
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
which unfortunately again

911
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
red tape with the client

912
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,640
they did not have two factor

913
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,000
authenticated enabled for their

914
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
microsoft either

915
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,839
and we were like just i told my boss was

916
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:46,480
like we

917
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,320
we got to do this we got they're just

918
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,359
it's more time played luck played with

919
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,079
like not getting breached

920
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,839
so and it's just again i had to

921
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,119
emphasize the 2fa

922
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,720
when something comes in like this

923
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,280
especially when a major application like

924
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
solarwinds

925
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,520
is branching off and affecting

926
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,200
third-party applications like

927
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,799
microsoft office 360.

928
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,240
good point so um

929
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,960
let's talk a little bit of the

930
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
challenges

931
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,040
based on what we've seen um

932
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,599
the challenges on securing the the

933
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,400
supply chain

934
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,920
right uh basically how for example

935
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,040
and this is a lot of this is uh sort of

936
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,320
a mix up with id operations to be honest

937
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,680
most of the time set-ups may have to do

938
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,760
with with security updates but not with

939
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
really regular

940
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
software updates for example so i

941
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,480
personally have worked in very large

942
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,520
environments as a system engineer

943
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,839
and changing configuration management

944
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:56,640
was

945
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,960
fundamental uh this is something that

946
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,800
that can truly prevent

947
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,839
uh certain types certain times let me

948
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,440
just say again certain types

949
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,720
of supply chain uh chain attacks

950
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,400
why because um the

951
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,040
the um the fact that you can that you

952
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,240
have a strict

953
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,079
uh configuration uh uh history

954
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,880
um and restrictions and changes that can

955
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
happen from one day to the other

956
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,119
um may indeed many times save you from

957
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,240
downloading malicious updates or

958
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,280
if something has changed there are so

959
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,000
many

960
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,359
checks in place that

961
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,480
it will be caught and uh i was a witness

962
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,320
of this many times where i actually had

963
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
to do

964
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
uh major upgrades uh

965
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,880
as we went through the um

966
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,800
the the configuration and change

967
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,720
management process there was a lot of

968
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
checks and uh

969
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,240
the type of patch we were gonna do uh

970
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
was this tested in development

971
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,680
there's there's a number of things uh

972
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
that can definitely help prevent this

973
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
type of attacks

974
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,880
certain types so then uh software

975
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
integrity obviously

976
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
uh this is something that you uh like

977
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
somebody brought up

978
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,880
in the chat you wanna you wanna check

979
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,079
the integrity of

980
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,000
uh the software you're gonna you wanna

981
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,200
make sure that

982
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,320
um you know this this

983
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
should be very basic basically checking

984
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
the the the checksums

985
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,560
uh if it's mp5 or for his shot 256

986
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
whatever it applies to it

987
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
that should be a common procedure

988
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,680
although this will not have

989
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,480
prevented the attacks uh for example the

990
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,880
star went because the signature

991
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
came from the the actual uh provider the

992
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,200
developer

993
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,520
but in some cases like for example let's

994
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
say

995
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,000
let's say for example you uh download a

996
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,800
certain

997
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,920
or a certain provider gets attacked and

998
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,880
is pushed

999
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
a certain version of the software is

1000
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,079
pushed uh

1001
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,760
if the attacker is not able to

1002
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,280
compromise the entire chain

1003
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,359
of the provider you might be able to

1004
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,160
catch it by checking integrity

1005
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,760
um also you want to you want to

1006
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,920
pay attention to inventory of assets and

1007
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
components

1008
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,599
uh within um within the chain

1009
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,560
basically you want to know um and make

1010
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,040
sure

1011
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,440
that you are aware every single thing

1012
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
that is involved

1013
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,079
uh in your supply chain like

1014
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,319
chris says including uh um

1015
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,599
third party uh applications

1016
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
and uh um or origin or components origin

1017
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
of applications and components and then

1018
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,800
you have to keep track uh and inventory

1019
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
uh without asset inventory which is

1020
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,160
something that is very basic and

1021
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,760
sometimes it's forgotten

1022
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,280
uh in many of the

1023
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,359
i.t and uh and security circles

1024
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,280
and that's your starting point you have

1025
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,440
to know what is it that i have here

1026
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
hardware wise software wise um

1027
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
also things such as the software

1028
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,440
development cycle security

1029
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,480
and this takes us back to

1030
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
are there open source components that

1031
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
are exposed are there libraries that are

1032
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,359
vulnerable are there um

1033
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,119
untrusted developer sources

1034
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,880
that we we need to take a look at and uh

1035
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,359
reiterating this uh third-party personal

1036
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,000
vendors

1037
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,880
uh obviously you have to uh there has to

1038
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,200
be

1039
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,960
um a uh management and control

1040
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,880
uh because obviously this may or may

1041
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,319
affect you uh in the sense of uh

1042
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,599
this type of attacks um so

1043
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,560
let's uh see you have something any

1044
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,359
comments on this uh chris or we're good

1045
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,280
i'm good okay so

1046
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,880
uh let's talk a little bit about um

1047
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,520
the miter uh supply chain attack

1048
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,040
framework i was actually like i said

1049
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,280
before this was this was a

1050
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,240
driver for me to research about the the

1051
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,040
open

1052
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,000
uh and um available sources of

1053
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,200
information

1054
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,520
uh in regards to supply chain attacks

1055
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,760
and i was able to find this there's a

1056
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,440
there's a nice white paper i will share

1057
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,240
it actually

1058
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,359
in in the discord later on

1059
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,880
uh where they actually were able to to

1060
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,400
create a catalog um

1061
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,839
supply chain uh attacks and uh they were

1062
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:48,960
able to identify

1063
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,800
41 types of this attacks

1064
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,040
uh created 20 countermeasures which

1065
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,839
we're going to see at the end of this

1066
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,480
presentation

1067
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,200
and they were basically able to create

1068
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,920
definitions of the different components

1069
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,440
that are included in the

1070
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
supply chain management at that surface

1071
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,960
and i wanted to show

1072
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,319
you this so what you see here

1073
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,520
is uh this can be a little convoluted

1074
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,119
uh we're not going to get into the

1075
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,960
specific of this

1076
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,560
but what you see in this graph

1077
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,720
is basically how miter was able to

1078
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,960
basically break

1079
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,839
the different components that uh that

1080
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,079
are

1081
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,920
involved in a supply chain

1082
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,680
attack and the possible insertion points

1083
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,160
the possible places right for example

1084
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,400
you can see

1085
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,240
things such as substitution alteration

1086
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,319
malware things that can be

1087
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,119
considered malicious insertion you can

1088
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:55,920
also see

1089
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,680
how um the things that are directed

1090
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,800
uh or components that can be directed at

1091
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,240
like system software development

1092
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,880
locations internal environments

1093
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,079
um parties that are involved

1094
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,640
in the supply chain such as some

1095
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,800
contractors

1096
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,319
prime contractors or even hardware and

1097
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,359
software components

1098
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
here's another example of the supply

1099
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,079
chain um

1100
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,200
uh points of attacks

1101
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,319
and uh this is something that we're not

1102
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,640
really going to

1103
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,119
deal with uh specifically attacked by

1104
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:37,760
attackers

1105
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
will be here forever uh but it's

1106
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,880
important for you to

1107
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,839
to to be aware of this and you can

1108
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,400
actually

1109
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,839
research this you can you can uh

1110
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,839
read on this um and

1111
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,440
apply this to your environment and see

1112
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,200
try to address if you are exposed and

1113
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,720
how to

1114
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,760
mitigate not sure if uh

1115
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,680
chris you have any comments on this or

1116
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,319
we're good to go

1117
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,880
yeah it's just like uh like what you

1118
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,160
were saying right about like the

1119
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,319
type of attack with the the firmware and

1120
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,640
how basically

1121
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,520
you just go insert it into and see how

1122
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,319
like you follow

1123
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,440
like basically with the p8 where

1124
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,880
it just traverses throughout and then

1125
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
it's like trying to stop like a runaway

1126
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,800
train that won't at this point now

1127
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,440
that's actually a good example that's a

1128
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,280
great example well maybe you can help me

1129
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,960
in this one uh chris

1130
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,119
here's the uh the the attack identifier

1131
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,160
821 and i took this from the catalog

1132
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,599
to bring up an example right in this

1133
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,839
case it's a software update

1134
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,119
that contains malicious code

1135
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,880
um is applied to the system being

1136
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,599
sustained

1137
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,800
so the attack vector for example

1138
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,240
is an adversary that can leverage uh

1139
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,000
um no hassle leverage against an

1140
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,839
automated process

1141
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,040
whereas it's gonna be this

1142
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,560
update is gonna be downloaded and

1143
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,680
installed and by doing so

1144
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,240
then obviously you're able to compromise

1145
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,119
whoever is

1146
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,400
installing this um uh

1147
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,240
update uh so here in the breakdown

1148
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,640
it tells you um like several of

1149
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,560
i guess items that are related to this

1150
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,319
type of attack like i said

1151
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,280
uh we're not going to do basically get

1152
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,079
into

1153
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,040
every single one of them but if you're a

1154
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,920
person that

1155
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,720
you work in manufacturing you work in in

1156
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,079
critical infrastructure

1157
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,400
or software development i highly suggest

1158
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,160
you that you read this framework

1159
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,520
take a look at the components

1160
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,400
and have a conversation with procurement

1161
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,160
have a conversation with set offs

1162
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,040
have a conversation with i.t where you

1163
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,480
can identify

1164
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,839
your potential points of exposure

1165
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,240
based on on this framework which i think

1166
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,959
is very useful

1167
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,200
and here's a something that we already

1168
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,160
touch on and

1169
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,480
uh i think chris is you're gonna get a

1170
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
better example on chris

1171
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,200
chris knows the story firsthand uh

1172
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,480
there's a reason why

1173
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,240
mssps are targeted they're targeted the

1174
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,280
mssps

1175
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,720
obviously they fulfill a

1176
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,760
an important uh function

1177
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,200
many companies they don't want to have a

1178
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,800
full-time id person

1179
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,040
many companies can't afford it right

1180
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,160
mssps

1181
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,000
have a function you know you have people

1182
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,760
that are trained that knows their

1183
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,800
products

1184
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,920
and that takes care of your environment

1185
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,240
so

1186
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,520
what happens if i attack the mssb and i

1187
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,040
can compromise the mssp

1188
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,400
now i have entries in their

1189
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,200
customers and here's what some of the

1190
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,520
things that chris says

1191
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,160
uh in regards uh for example things such

1192
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,800
as

1193
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,319
uh 2fa when somebody's

1194
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,839
accessing your assistance remotely

1195
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,359
can how can potentially help

1196
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,119
discover or even isolate or contain

1197
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,400
a supply chain

1198
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,160
uh sort of an attack

1199
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,160
i'm not sure if you have any uh any

1200
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,000
other comments or mssps or

1201
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,359
things that you want to tell us um

1202
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,640
with me handling the solo wins i know

1203
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,760
that you do have audit logs

1204
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
being enabled for at least for us being

1205
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,599
as the vendor we did have outlaws we

1206
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,559
were

1207
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,200
had the ability to verily see activity

1208
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,400
about

1209
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,599
um we as the vendor interacting with

1210
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,000
said client at certain time on certain

1211
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
workstations so

1212
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,079
yeah i would just say like you check

1213
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,440
your logs daily

1214
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,559
especially with solarwinds or just any

1215
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,200
mssp

1216
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,119
like this but yeah just make sure you

1217
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,240
have audit logs enabled

1218
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,839
awesome so uh since we already touching

1219
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:16,640
this

1220
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,359
i also wanted to let you know that there

1221
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,160
are

1222
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,680
some uh micro attack techniques

1223
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,319
uh which basically are under t1195

1224
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,119
um nowadays this is sort of the language

1225
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,319
we all speak

1226
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,680
um i i i myself every time i had to

1227
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,200
produce a report

1228
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,559
or uh communicate with an external party

1229
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,359
or colleague i had to use this so that

1230
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,800
way is this

1231
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,920
is clear of what i'm

1232
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,040
referring uh like in terms of uh

1233
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,480
tools techniques and uh or tools tactics

1234
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,680
uh and procedures so um

1235
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,960
within the the realm of supply chain

1236
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,079
attacks uh there are some supply chain

1237
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,119
compromise

1238
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,720
uh ttps which are under um

1239
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,160
t 1195 which uh include compromises

1240
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,359
software dependencies

1241
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,680
and development tools compromises

1242
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,000
software supply chain

1243
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,040
compromised hardware supply chain

1244
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,400
so there's something that is already

1245
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,319
included in the miter attack framework

1246
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,680
um so here's a uh

1247
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,160
some of the the things that sort of we

1248
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,599
already touch on

1249
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,800
but it is important to uh

1250
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,640
to look at them because uh i guess

1251
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,400
and this is something that happened to

1252
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,079
me as i was doing this research

1253
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,920
uh i realized there were many things

1254
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,160
that i took for granted

1255
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,960
uh things that i buy things that that

1256
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,920
you procure

1257
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,119
things that you install things that

1258
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,720
are in your systems that you have no

1259
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,240
idea

1260
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,480
where they're coming from uh and that's

1261
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
why we did the contextual

1262
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,720
slide because you may have all this

1263
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,480
configuration management

1264
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,559
uh all this is strict procedures but

1265
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,359
then you go to best buy and you buy this

1266
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,280
cheap chinese router and then you're

1267
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,920
compromised so these are things that

1268
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
that you gotta be careful you have you

1269
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,960
definitely have to be careful you have

1270
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,760
to be

1271
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,960
uh on the lookout and uh here's some of

1272
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,480
the uh

1273
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,400
um uh points where

1274
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,720
uh the supply chain can be compromised

1275
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,880
so which we already talked on such as

1276
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,319
development tools development

1277
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,079
environment source code

1278
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,440
repositories uh even if they're public

1279
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,559
or private

1280
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,200
uh open source dependencies uh

1281
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,960
distribution mechanisms

1282
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,000
uh systems are infected

1283
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,319
uh um replacement on legitimate software

1284
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,160
with modify versions that that's

1285
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,599
actually one of the most difficult

1286
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,680
in my opinion to to actually um

1287
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,799
detect uh modifier counterfeit products

1288
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,760
to legitimate distributors and shipment

1289
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,839
interdiction that that can happen to

1290
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,800
which i sort of describe it like for

1291
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,520
example you

1292
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,440
realize that a victim is procuring

1293
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,000
a number of devices they're intersected

1294
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,119
at one point

1295
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,720
uh and uh hardware

1296
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,040
or even forward or even software

1297
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,000
components are

1298
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,079
maliciously inserted and then they go

1299
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,920
and get installed at the

1300
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,359
victim okay

1301
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,880
um so uh we had heard some of the

1302
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,920
great recommendations from chris uh

1303
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,200
for uh detection he suggested

1304
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,920
um to basically check your logs i think

1305
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,359
the visibility

1306
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,880
right this ability meaning if you are

1307
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,920
if you're not already

1308
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,440
reviewing analyzing the locks for

1309
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,760
the potential sources involved in this

1310
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,040
type of attack

1311
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,359
then you have to start from there

1312
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,520
and in this case what we want to do

1313
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,040
besides the visibility we had to have

1314
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,160
uh verification of the binaries

1315
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,800
right um which can be done through hash

1316
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,680
checking i think i

1317
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,800
already mentioned this um there is

1318
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,200
there is uh you can always do software

1319
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,960
checks them

1320
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,440
in uh they are published even kali

1321
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,000
pali for example has his own hashes that

1322
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,839
you can check when you download it

1323
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,640
uh there there is a mechanism uh and if

1324
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,000
your vendor doesn't give you that

1325
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,960
they they must give you that like if

1326
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,160
they're gonna send you a patch

1327
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,839
or they're gonna send you a new version

1328
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,839
of a software there should be

1329
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,800
four stars a way to check the integrity

1330
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,920
and the integrity is usually checked by

1331
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,319
sorry

1332
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,520
running reserve a hashing a mechanism

1333
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,000
that produces exactly the same hash

1334
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,319
whatever is downloaded um that is one

1335
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,280
way to do it

1336
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,240
however if the vendor is compromised

1337
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,960
this

1338
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,000
won't do much but this is one way of

1339
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,079
checking for possible compromise uh also

1340
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,079
you can scan downloads for malicious

1341
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,839
signatures

1342
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,480
and like i said before change

1343
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,079
configuration management

1344
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,280
uh testing software and updates in

1345
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,480
developer environments uh taking the

1346
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,440
time

1347
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,040
uh uh to actually perform this radical

1348
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,079
updates

1349
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,599
or upgrades at times may save you

1350
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,799
from uh just arbitrarily installing

1351
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,000
something that is

1352
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,400
malicious by next year because your

1353
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,480
vendor was compromised

1354
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,319
they also suggest this is also from

1355
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,520
mitre uh

1356
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,160
perform physical inspection hardware to

1357
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,559
look for potential tempering

1358
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,680
uh there's an actual uh a contest

1359
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,480
in def con called tamper evident uh that

1360
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,680
has to do with uh

1361
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,040
uh uh this type of checks just uh just

1362
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,000
saying

1363
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,440
um so let's move on

1364
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,119
uh here's some of the suggested

1365
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,960
mitigations

1366
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,480
um obviously um

1367
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,480
we had to look at verification uh

1368
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,880
um sorry we had to look at

1369
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,559
uh patch management uh one dispatch

1370
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:33,839
management

1371
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,839
process is implemented obviously

1372
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,280
you have to go for the basics where is

1373
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,680
this coming from is this verified

1374
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,720
has this been tested who sent us this

1375
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,119
uh does the signature check with what

1376
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,000
the vendor

1377
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,480
sends us the problem many times guys and

1378
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,160
i know this coming from the i.t

1379
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,200
world is that there's no such thing you

1380
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,760
know we

1381
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,640
we patch emergencies uh you know we're

1382
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,880
told we have to push the service back

1383
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,319
we're told there's this new um

1384
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,960
threat and we have to update and apply a

1385
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,440
patch and that's perfectly fine at times

1386
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,280
but if you are a company uh

1387
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,720
that is aware of risks and is highly

1388
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,440
targeted

1389
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,960
you know these things have to be done

1390
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,280
through a process these things have to

1391
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:21,920
do

1392
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,319
it had to be done carefully and there's

1393
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,000
many things that you had to check

1394
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,799
including

1395
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,520
vulnerable to happen dependencies

1396
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,880
unnecessary features

1397
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,079
components files

1398
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,280
things that may simply

1399
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,720
allow the adversary to get a hold on

1400
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,839
your

1401
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,520
surface and one of them

1402
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,359
is obviously paying attention to

1403
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,240
the software update management or even

1404
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,240
updating the software

1405
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,599
when it's found to be vulnerable

1406
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,760
uh also they recommend uh vulnerability

1407
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,359
scanning which is continuously

1408
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,240
monitoring

1409
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,720
uh wounded ability sources uh some of

1410
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,839
these attacks

1411
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,319
uh you have you you basically it's i

1412
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,000
would say it's too expensive

1413
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,920
uh to detect like for example what

1414
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,599
microsoft did with the patch that

1415
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,839
the malicious patch where they had to go

1416
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,280
code by code i don't think that's

1417
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,319
practical

1418
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,760
uh so basically the the more efficient

1419
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,480
way to do this

1420
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,319
is to uh uh to do it at the basics of

1421
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,760
uh once again what is it that i have in

1422
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,559
my systems

1423
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,880
where is it coming from uh what are the

1424
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,720
possible insertion points

1425
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,960
what is it that worries me uh do i have

1426
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,839
a

1427
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,040
an architecture that will prevent

1428
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,880
an adversary even if they're able to get

1429
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,559
in to go further

1430
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,839
so there are many um

1431
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,960
considerations that you can do as

1432
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,400
basic prevention measures

1433
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,720
uh to protect yourself against this type

1434
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,920
of attacks

1435
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,839
um and here's the the the

1436
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,040
countermeasures that they

1437
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,720
actually propose uh in their white paper

1438
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,599
uh which we already talked about it but

1439
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,720
i'm just gonna

1440
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,880
show them here and and comment to some

1441
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,400
of them uh

1442
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,480
one of them is actually supply chain red

1443
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,200
teaming uh in order for you to do this

1444
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,319
you had to visualize and outline your

1445
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,400
supply chain and then have somebody test

1446
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,440
it

1447
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,319
have somebody think like an adversary

1448
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,400
and attack it

1449
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
and that should give you an idea of

1450
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,839
where

1451
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,200
your insertion points might be present

1452
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,319
uh things such as uh tracking tax and

1453
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,400
security attacks simple things right the

1454
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,480
the the again i it comes down to

1455
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,599
what is it that i have um when did i

1456
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,799
install it

1457
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,799
what version i have um was this tested

1458
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,559
um sort of a thorough revision of the

1459
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:57,920
basics

1460
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,720
of asset management and inventory and i

1461
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,240
think that will get you started pretty

1462
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,359
quick

1463
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,839
um there are other things that are

1464
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,440
interesting like for example

1465
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,559
uh um verifying your your

1466
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,760
uh your vendors uh buying a bulk of

1467
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,480
spares

1468
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,079
so you don't have to buy from uh uh

1469
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,119
sources that may

1470
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,640
use or target you

1471
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,440
by other vendors

1472
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,480
and use some multiple suppliers

1473
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,520
um this is a little bit more like

1474
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,760
a advanced like electromagnetic

1475
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,640
uh thermal analysis not sure if uh you

1476
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,599
did some of it

1477
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,599
uh chris you totally look like you did

1478
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,880
some of this

1479
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,920
but uh yeah yeah i did uh

1480
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,119
i was working at uh raytheon

1481
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,480
one of the quality insurance checks i

1482
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,119
had to do

1483
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,559
was for doing an em and

1484
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,799
thermal analysis to make sure that it

1485
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,000
met the standards and

1486
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,480
quality before we released it to the to

1487
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,640
the customer

1488
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,000
excellent so uh uh

1489
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,599
these are again some of the

1490
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,400
countermeasures uh the miter proposes

1491
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,160
against uh this attacks again uh i'll i

1492
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,280
will be sharing the

1493
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,119
the uri on the white paper uh so you can

1494
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,880
actually research further

1495
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,720
and uh um um

1496
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,280
with that uh we're gonna i think that's

1497
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,720
it unless you have something else that

1498
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,839
you want to talk about chris

1499
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,880
um yeah so back to what you're talking

1500
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,240
about about the hash

1501
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,760
about when receiving the patch or uh

1502
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,960
software um given

1503
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,760
right now what has been going on lately

1504
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,359
i think like

1505
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,200
we need to do like a

1506
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
in part like a physical hashtag we need

1507
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,799
to verify

1508
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,240
not just digitally but like physically

1509
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,880
like okay we know the vendor gave a good

1510
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,760
product we have

1511
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,000
they haven't established with us but

1512
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,119
don't trust it completely so do like

1513
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:13,760
what we do

1514
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,079
with acme like we have something the

1515
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,599
rule needs to get from it we need to

1516
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,160
stage it

1517
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,400
so like what you're talking about you

1518
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,760
retain it

1519
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,559
put it in a sandbox network in the

1520
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,599
environment

1521
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,280
make it look like it was like the real

1522
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,520
thing for the customer

1523
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,200
so start looking for the vector start

1524
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,799
looking for entry points look and see

1525
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,440
what it's

1526
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,079
doing uh like run wireshark look at the

1527
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,119
packets he was

1528
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,480
trying to talk to and

1529
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,119
another thing too also is that

1530
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,160
when it comes to like patches

1531
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,720
uh and other future um software's coming

1532
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,599
out

1533
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,400
yeah it's always good to like you know

1534
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,039
you know investigate it don't don't

1535
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,680
i mean you can give you sell great demo

1536
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,960
but

1537
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,079
you know it again you know just you know

1538
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
listen to your team

1539
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,680
because like it and like you know it's a

1540
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,359
it's a team effort because like you have

1541
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,400
the devs

1542
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,720
it's like developing the code we gotta

1543
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,319
have the security engineers

1544
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,760
and the architects look into it and it's

1545
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,720
like no it looks good but let's like

1546
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,799
you know you know trust but don't trust

1547
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,880
but verify basically exactly just

1548
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,359
exactly

1549
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,359
i wanted to ask you about this chris

1550
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:30,640
that

1551
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,240
since since we had this um campaign

1552
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,000
which was uh the salt wins one and then

1553
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,400
now it recently had the colonial

1554
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,720
which is not supply chain but the

1555
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,839
government

1556
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,799
and that's that's what my question is uh

1557
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:45,119
the

1558
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,799
the executive order has push um

1559
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,400
zero trust as a one of the

1560
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,400
the i guess the defense against uh

1561
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,039
many types of attacks including uh

1562
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,680
supply chain

1563
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,599
yeah um so

1564
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,200
i i i know this is kind of like rambling

1565
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,520
but

1566
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,599
it it like it's like how many times

1567
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,799
does the client the customer does us as

1568
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,640
the citizens of this country

1569
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,079
have to go through to continuous attacks

1570
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,400
from private sector public sector it's

1571
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,119
just like

1572
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,559
for like they need to

1573
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,039
really understand and if then we

1574
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,240
emphasize like

1575
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,280
you this is serious this that we could

1576
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,039
be actually still under its attack

1577
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,119
it's just not like the the not the

1578
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,480
conventional kinetic

1579
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,640
you know base like you know wars the

1580
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,319
desert wars the guerrilla wars but

1581
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,960
this is cyber war this is cyber warfare

1582
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,480
and we could be still be going under

1583
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,160
attack even right now

1584
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,280
the special solomons that just that

1585
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:53,839
opened

1586
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,079
not only a can of worms that opened a

1587
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,680
carton of cannel

1588
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,839
so now they were able to go everywhere

1589
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,839
and then it

1590
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,760
if you were running in like a patch or

1591
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,039
a packet analysis and then see like

1592
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,480
how solar winds could be connected to

1593
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,599
say like the colonial or um

1594
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,280
what else like the the the mta

1595
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,720
or like some of these other

1596
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,759
the taxes just

1597
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,839
you start connecting dots to the point

1598
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,400
like okay when is it enough

1599
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,720
when is it so and and i think really the

1600
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,839
colonial

1601
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,359
pipeline really really hit like that was

1602
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:37,760
it

1603
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,880
because in the government in the earth

1604
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,559
government's mind

1605
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,000
um the clone pipeline even though the

1606
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,119
reason why the

1607
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,640
company said they should they shut it

1608
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,240
down because of billing they can't just

1609
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,039
like give

1610
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,240
free fuel for right but the

1611
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,200
the it is a national security because

1612
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,799
that affects

1613
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,880
everybody that affects the military that

1614
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,319
affects the commercial that

1615
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,480
it hits everywhere and especially to

1616
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,960
look at the diagram of the pipeline

1617
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,599
where or

1618
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,359
start from where it ends it basically

1619
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,720
took

1620
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,799
from the south southeast to like near

1621
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,520
the near the north near pennsylvania i'm

1622
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,759
like

1623
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,839
to me that is a de facto state of war

1624
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,599
that was an after war right there

1625
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,920
because you literally hit everybody and

1626
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,799
that was including

1627
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:34,079
civilians so well i actually kevin

1628
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,280
uh kevin tucker uh just wrote that

1629
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,680
um which is something that i just read

1630
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,359
uh apparently the fbi is

1631
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,880
is considering ransomware actors now as

1632
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,599
terrorists uh i think you're right i

1633
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:48,160
think we

1634
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,400
we have passed uh the the point of the

1635
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,640
annoyance or nuisance or oh it's just

1636
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,680
espionage to

1637
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,039
wait a minute uh is the gas

1638
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,400
it's the subway uh is the me what else

1639
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,119
is next

1640
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,119
uh so or it could have been the

1641
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,640
government if you think about it

1642
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,359
if they have gone disruptive or selling

1643
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,160
wins

1644
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,200
i mean who knows how many services from

1645
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
the actual government so

1646
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,440
i um i think like with the solo wins

1647
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,119
though i think

1648
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,400
we still have not seen the end of this

1649
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,839
yet i don't think we should we're still

1650
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:26,720
assessing it

1651
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,280
and right now i think what we're seeing

1652
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,280
is just like the ripple effects

1653
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,520
that then gain access to compromise

1654
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,119
credentials logins or in this case like

1655
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,119
like

1656
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,520
networks or or equipment that it's not

1657
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,720
even patched

1658
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,480
and they're just in it but and then we

1659
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,680
need to emphasize it that

1660
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,119
equipment itself that we get regardless

1661
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,400
of the sector or vendor you work for

1662
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,799
this equipment will not update itself

1663
01:06:58,799 --> 01:06:59,599
you still

1664
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,680
have to physically or like put in the

1665
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,799
code that yes

1666
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:06,640
update if it affects your

1667
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,920
your revenue or your your

1668
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,039
operation of business well put this in

1669
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,160
perspective

1670
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,799
look how long the colonial pipeline was

1671
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:17,359
down

1672
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,480
because of this ransomware or the food

1673
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,480
packing or the mta i mean

1674
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,119
in other previous attacks look how long

1675
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,799
they were down for and we're not talking

1676
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:27,599
about

1677
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,839
what

1678
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,720
versus okay we can run this patch we

1679
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,760
need to run

1680
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,640
this critical update to these systems

1681
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,559
okay let's do it when it's that peak

1682
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,680
hour let's do it

1683
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,079
two three o'clock in the morning where

1684
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,160
it's like this little traffic

1685
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,240
minimize the impact and i'm telling you

1686
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,119
it just if we can emphasize that to

1687
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,960
all these other and even then

1688
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,200
with the ransomware it's like uh with

1689
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,839
the kelowna pilot they paid the ransom

1690
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,640
they got the uh decrypting software but

1691
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,680
did they realize like

1692
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,599
wait it's it's not efficient

1693
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,559
so another thing to consider too is a uh

1694
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,839
a uh a disaster recovery plan literally

1695
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:16,319
like like

1696
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,399
in like one of your slides like you have

1697
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,520
a

1698
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,679
a it's kind of like and since it's

1699
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,679
almost like in

1700
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,000
being a prepper you buy all this water

1701
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
you buy all this food

1702
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,520
you know just have it and have it in

1703
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,198
place just in case something happens and

1704
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,880
i think that's what needs to happen also

1705
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,600
with these

1706
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,198
vendors that you know if you can't do

1707
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:38,238
anything else

1708
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,000
get it back up as soon as possible that

1709
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,839
way you have these supplies right here

1710
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,040
have these

1711
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,880
this equipment ready to go like in the

1712
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,520
event of ransomware attack

1713
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,399
and they should not be paying that first

1714
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,359
thought and then

1715
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,120
they should not it all it just it just

1716
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,479
it really encourages

1717
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,960
the actors to do it again to others

1718
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,759
right

1719
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:02,560
right so reinforces reinforces

1720
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,198
i know and look it's just a hard drive

1721
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,198
this is like a six terabyte hard drive

1722
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:07,839
look how much

1723
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,560
information this thing can hold and and

1724
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,839
and then

1725
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,000
just buy it and then you know hold on to

1726
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,279
it and if you need to do

1727
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,000
like updates on it fine but you know

1728
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,640
have it

1729
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,759
readily available in the event like you

1730
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,399
basically get attacked and like okay

1731
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:25,679
don't pay the ransom

1732
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,920
just start immediately start re getting

1733
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,880
your systems back

1734
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,839
up oh that's that that's that's

1735
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,120
definitely an option

1736
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,040
some of them have chosen to pay for some

1737
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,880
reason i i mean we don't know the

1738
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,719
specific of this right uh

1739
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,319
we don't know if they really got them

1740
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,399
good which is what that's this is what i

1741
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:42,719
think

1742
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,198
i think they got them so good that they

1743
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,719
had no choice about debate

1744
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,640
and and the criminals know that that's

1745
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,839
why they don't

1746
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,158
they do their job first they take the

1747
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:53,600
the x fill

1748
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,080
right ransom move around and make sure

1749
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,840
that they got all the backups

1750
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,159
and everything they need to get so that

1751
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,040
way they leave you

1752
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,040
one alternative and that is paid so

1753
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,600
um i know we're dividing a little bit

1754
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,360
from the from the supply chain although

1755
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:09,679
it

1756
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,120
does have a little bit to do with it uh

1757
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,239
but uh at the end of the day uh overall

1758
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,360
i think i think it was soloing uh

1759
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,080
what really started in my opinion uh

1760
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,320
opening my eyes of how bad things

1761
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,880
are uh and and and i can see it has

1762
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,480
gotten worse

1763
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,719
uh uh right after that which is now we

1764
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,600
have all this uh

1765
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,320
ransomware campaigns uh but it tells us

1766
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,080
how how vulnerable and uh

1767
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,400
how unprepared that's my opinion and

1768
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,679
their only government

1769
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,520
private sector and so when um

1770
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,000
it's private government and uh when the

1771
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
ransomware it looks like it's

1772
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,360
mostly uh the latest campaigns are

1773
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,199
vertical uh critical infrastructure

1774
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,320
uh type of companies yeah

1775
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,920
yeah and and it's just

1776
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:13,840
see somebody has a question

1777
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:19,360
any uh opinions questions

1778
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,360
yeah i i say yeah the ics iot man look

1779
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,719
look what happened in osmar

1780
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,840
be able to go in and start uh

1781
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,560
adjusting the chemical levels and only

1782
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,520
because

1783
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,600
a guy was actually at the right place at

1784
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,120
the right time in front of the screen

1785
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,280
noticing that his mouse was moving

1786
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,159
without him moving

1787
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,760
it if he wasn't there

1788
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,679
that water supply would have been like

1789
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,920
damaged like we would we would be having

1790
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,560
a silver case with like flint missions

1791
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,080
we can't trust a drink we can't trust

1792
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,840
the tap water yes our buying

1793
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,880
bottle of water now you were you were

1794
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,520
actually close to that right

1795
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,600
yeah i'm not i'm like maybe one county

1796
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,120
over and i know

1797
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,280
like because of covet like everybody's

1798
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,880
been gone having to

1799
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,000
do remote and that's really put a strain

1800
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,600
on working like remotely and having to

1801
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,320
adjust

1802
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,760
from working from set office to

1803
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,600
your home yeah again it's just like

1804
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,320
your security plan your your security

1805
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,480
initiatives have to adjust

1806
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,880
to whatever operation you're conducting

1807
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,840
if it's in person

1808
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,320
hybrid or totally remote you've got it

1809
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,040
and

1810
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,640
i know the internet was originally

1811
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,400
designed to be connectivity

1812
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,920
to be open but you also have to make it

1813
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,199
secure too so you gotta have that

1814
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,678
balance

1815
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,360
any other questions

1816
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:57,599
uh i'm gonna stop the recording now
