00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,720
a drone i'm gonna bring over some little

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,040
toy drones so if you have some kit

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,119

that want to crash a micro drone

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
they're pretty fun

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
and uh i think

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,159
bring over the 3d printer and see if i

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
can find some small things that could be

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
set to print out through the menu

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,079
interface so people get a handle for 3d

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
printing so it's a fun community

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,000
community event for our community

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
the topic of today

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
is cryptography because crypto means

101
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,040
cryptography and i will die on that hill

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,879
uh

103
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,239
my team has put together a brand new ctf

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
platform one that we are going to be

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
deploying into everything that we do so

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,040
we're pretty excited to see this

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,840
uh being used for the first time so you

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
guys are the first eyes uh so feel free

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
to give us some feedback

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,200
and um and whatnot because this is this

111
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,720
is really uh exciting for us

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,440
we know from the students that we serve

113
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,798
and the places that we go that

114
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,560
cryptography tends to be one of those

115
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
topics that everybody runs away from as

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
soon as they hear oh you have to do math

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,639
so

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
the team has been working on building a

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,759
introductory ctf that

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
shows you how you can do this without

121
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
freaking out

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,160
and

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,800
me personally i am not a programmer i

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
don't like math but

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,600
this ctf has shown that yes you can do

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
this and not freak out like many people

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,639
do

128
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,960
so really happy to see this uh come

129
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
together

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
uh

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
the ctf

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
is at this link

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,680
on test.baycyber.net

134

it doesn't have to be

143
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
anything real it's not going to verify

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,479

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
the gear icon

173
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,639
yeah so call

174
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,120
your own team whatever you want

175
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,880
and assign whatever password you want

176
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
for this event remembering the the team

177
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
password isn't the

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,880
the worst of the worst because

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
you know it's just gonna be this

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
two-hour event

181
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
uh and now once once you make that team

182
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
you'll be able to see the various

183
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
challenges and the scoreboard

184
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,919
uh and everything you need to play this

185
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,800
game

186
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,319
so i'm going to introduce the three

187
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,400
presenters who will be guiding you

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
on playing this game and that's jordan

189
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
max and karen

190
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,360
and the rest of our team is also here

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
jose abraham braglio tyler and tomas

192
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
so if you have any questions please put

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
them in the chat we will be more than

194
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
glad to help you out

195
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
with that i'm going to hand it over to

196
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,560
karen who will help uh we'll get started

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
and if you want to jump ahead go for it

198
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
you know we have uh seven categories

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
we're building out more questions as we

200
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,919
go

201
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,960
again

202
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,240
ask away

203
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,599
and uh any feedback is always welcomed

204
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,639
so karen it's all on you

205
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,360
oh let me uh make you a presenter or are

206
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
you a presenter

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,640
i got it i'm not right now

208
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,919
um

209
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,399
i did want to mention that uh the front

210
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
end for the hints feature is not

211
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,519
available yet on our new platform so if

212
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,279
you see hint available in the

213
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,720
description

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
um

215
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
or in the question text

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
that means there is a hint available and

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,959
if you want um the hint

218
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,440
information please just message in the

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
chat that you want it and we'll get back

220
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
to you with that hint information

221
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
so with that um the first uh

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
question in the introduction section is

223
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
just about our flag format should be

224
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,839
pretty self-explanatory so i'm not gonna

225
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,040
walk through that with you guys

226
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
um

227
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
the second question

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
should be

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
pincher

230
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,600
sorry there's a

231
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,800
some order differences from

232
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
how we first set this up

233
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,040
um

234
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
and

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,720
um the second question mostly is asking

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
about the purpose of cryptography um or

237
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,839
one of the core purposes of cryptography

238
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,839
um and its place within security

239
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
um the answer to this is based on the

240
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
cia triad

241
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,279
um

242
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
and

243
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,360
you can get to the answer by googling

244
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,320
for

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,200
purposes of cryptography

246
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
um

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,600
aaron can you show the question because

248
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
all we're seeing is google right now

249
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,680
yeah i do i can sign up on the uh

250
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
i can log in on contest update cyber and

251
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
um show the questions please

252
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,640
um also one thing to keep in mind um

253
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,519
right now with the front end um

254
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,200
functionality to see

255
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
scoreboard updates you need to refresh

256
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
the browser

257
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,320
all all little things that we'll be

258
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,839
fixing as

259
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,399
as we go

260
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
okay um can everybody see the challenges

261
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,800
now

262
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,079
yes yep

263
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,760
okay that's great um

264
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
so hopefully everybody's passed the

265
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,959
first question

266
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,279
um

267
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,880
do you want me to read the questions

268
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,360
would that be helpful

269
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
yeah if i think uh people have questions

270
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
they should you could

271
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
uh message karen privately or

272
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
any of the other people in there and

273
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,600
yeah you can just

274
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,120
drop a line in the chat and we'll get to

275
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
you

276
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,279
yeah

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
let's see how it goes

278
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
okay it's great

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
um

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,200
the next question names for 200

281
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,519
um

282
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,399
is a uh

283
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,839
really about

284
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,120
um terminology in cryptography

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
um

286
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
so what is an encrypted

287
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,079
uh message what is um or what is

288
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,160
encryption what is decryption what is

289
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,220
plain text

290
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,720
[Music]

291
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
if you google

292
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,720
um

293
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
the phrase

294
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,480
term for encrypted message text

295
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,120
you will get the answer to this question

296
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,519
uh

297
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
yeah one thing that i found that's

298
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
interesting with cryptography is it's

299
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
sort of its own vast field and so

300
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
having a foundational

301
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
understanding of some of the terminology

302
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
that's used i think can help make things

303
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
less confusing

304
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
um because even when i first started out

305
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
you know i was like

306
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,839
getting confused if encryption what the

307
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,440
difference was between encryption and

308
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,519
encoding

309
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
you know it can be a little

310
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,360
circular uh with

311
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
you know kind of moving from one bit of

312
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,199
text you're doing something to it to

313
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
alter it to become the ciphertext and

314
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,880
you're doing something again to have it

315
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,720
you know come back to this plain text

316
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,199
sort of these inverse relationships so

317
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,560
we definitely wanted to have something

318
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,639
that um

319
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,560
introduced folks to some of that basic

320
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
terminology that you're going to kind of

321
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
see as you continue through uh

322
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,040
cryptography related problems

323
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
so you always you're starting out with

324
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,040
your plain text encrypting to ciphertext

325
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,639
and then decrypting back to plain text

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,000
okay um thank you jordan

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,800
um the next question uh cake um is just

328
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,519
a plain logic question um it relates

329
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,959
tangentially to cryptography um it's

330
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,800
also a yes or no question so you can go

331
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,279
ahead and guess if you uh don't want to

332
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,720
bother um

333
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
reading through the question

334
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
um

335
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,399
i'm sorry

336
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,040
the answer is a

337
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,720
um the important thing about um

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
this is how it relates to cryptography

339
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
um

340
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,920
mostly if you think about

341
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
money

342
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
in the analogy um in this question is

343
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,040
that money um but in reality when we're

344
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
talking about cryptography we're talking

345
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
about data

346
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,680
um but data is worth money

347
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,480
so

348
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
if you think about this question in

349
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,600
terms of how you need to protect your

350
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,880
data

351
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,720
it

352
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
stresses the importance

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
of

354
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,880
protecting your data at all times

355
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
not just when it's in transit but also

356
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,040
when it's at rest

357
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,279
okay uh practice does not make perfect

358
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,079
um

359
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,240
this is another terminology and sort of

360
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,360
um cryptography theory question

361
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
um

362
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,519
if you google for theoretically perfect

363
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,160
encryption method

364
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,639
you will get to the answer um

365
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
and it's important to understand when

366
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
you're looking at this question that

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
um

368
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
this theoretically perfect encryption

369
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
method is not one that we use in any of

370
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,759
our data systems

371
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
which means that

372
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
all of our crypto systems that we use

373
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,000
are not even perfect in theory much less

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,839
in implementation

375
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
so they all have potential

376
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,839
vulnerabilities that can be exploited

377
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,360
it's funny i actually think i read

378
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
somewhere that like

379
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
maybe there's like swiss bankers who use

380
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
this

381
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,320
uh one-time pad encryption but

382
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,680
i feel like that's another level of

383
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,959
security needed though still incredibly

384
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
impractical sorry

385
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,400
is that how they make swiss cheese

386
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,480
yeah um

387
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
so one time pads are just

388
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,919
i

389
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,359
have a lot of

390
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,079
difficulty with implementing them

391
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,720
you need a secure side channel in order

392
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
to exchange

393
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,319
your keys in the first place

394
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,119
and

395
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,840
the discipline necessary to actually

396
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
only use

397
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
the each key once is

398
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
very difficult and if you run out of

399
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
keys you can't send any more data

400
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,960
so um that's another issue with them

401
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
and one of and reasons that we don't use

402
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,720
them in actuality

403
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,799
so

404
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
always the same is introducing

405
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,160
aspects of cryptanalysis

406
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
um which is

407
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
the

408
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,600
so when we talk about cryptography

409
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,799
there's

410
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,160
all the

411
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
parts where we're worried about

412
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
cryptosystems and how to

413
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
encrypt data securely

414
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,760
cryptanalysis is all about

415
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,919
um

416
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,760
how we

417
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,880
uh

418
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
are

419
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,400
um attacking cryptosystems

420
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,559
um so cryptanalysis is all how we can

421
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,000
analyze

422
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
um data that we can get from

423
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,679
cryptosystems

424
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,880
and

425
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,880
um

426
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
and

427
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
break it

428
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,200
one second

429
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
so um

430
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
in cryptanalysis there are various types

431
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
of attacks

432
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,480
that we can do

433
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,440
um on a system

434
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
and if we google for types of

435
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,399
cryptanalysis attacks

436
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,880
we got a lovely page from geeksforgeeks

437
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,640
that talks about

438
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
um different types of cryptanalysis

439
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
attacks

440
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
um

441
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,679
and

442
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,840
if you read about them

443
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,280
um and

444
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
uh

445
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
this particular question is talking

446
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
about a known plain text attack

447
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,039
um or known plain text analysis and the

448
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,840
the answer is just known plain text

449
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
um

450
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,320
because we know a phrase

451
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,080
um of

452
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
the

453
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,919
um of the plain text that's why it's a

454
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,720
known plain text attack

455
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,280
and it's actually a very widely used

456
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
method and is a vulnerability in a lot

457
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,120
of cryptosystems if you use repetitive

458
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,039
text

459
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,480
over and over

460
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
um it's why you

461
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
if you're interested in in keeping your

462
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,000
encryption methodology secure

463
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,880
um

464
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,120
you should not use like the same header

465
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
on every message

466
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
because if they break one

467
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
or

468
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,200
have a way to find out what that header

469
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
is then they can do some known plain

470
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
text analysis

471
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,679
um in the cryptanalysis

472
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,240
against your system

473
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
and with that we are done with the

474
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
introductions

475
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,559
section

476
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,280
i think we're going to

477
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,559
take a

478
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
break before we get into

479
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
the next section

480
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,559
yes

481
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,440
that is right so we'll take about a five

482
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
minute break so if uh if you're working

483
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
on any of the other

484
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,080
challenges and you have a question now

485
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,000
is the time to to speak up and we can

486
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,039
help you

487
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
um and then yeah five or so minutes then

488
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
we'll we'll start the next

489
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,080
uh the next round of questions

490
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,520
but thank you for having me getting

491
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,960
started

492
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
you're welcome and if you have any

493
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,600
questions about the introduction section

494
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,320
um please don't hesitate

495
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
philip says i'm struggling more with the

496
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,400
expected flag format than anything else

497
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
okay okay

498
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,760
max you're on it awesome thank you

499
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
nestor i was trying to hack a communist

500
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
bank in latin america but cali tools

501
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,559
seem to be out of date

502
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,559
uh i'm not gonna answer that one

503
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,360
it seems to be a personal issue yeah

504
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
um

505
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,120
oh that's a good point for the people uh

506
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,918
make a note of that

507
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,720
yeah i believe some of these questions

508
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
we may have forgotten to specify

509
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,559
all lower case or something like that

510
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,240
do you guys hear my dog snoring

511
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
nope

512
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
all right

513
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,000
yeah no i hear silence

514
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,559
okay

515
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,600
uh it's 11 35 my time

516
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,679
uh so for the next

517
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,240
uh 30 minutes or so i'm gonna hand it

518
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,840
over to max

519
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,600
our second presenter who will show you a

520
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,279
couple more questions

521
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,120
from our ctf and again

522
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,640
please ask away in the chat if you're

523
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,720
stuck at any point

524
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,080
we are here to help you out

525
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
all right moving right along to

526
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,679
obfuscation

527
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,559
so

528
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,080
as you may know

529
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
cryptography has been a very important

530
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,559
subject even before computers

531
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,200
especially in warfare

532
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,320
uh the origins of cryptography date back

533
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
to uh codes and ciphers

534
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,919
um that mostly involve some form of

535
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,159
obfuscation which

536
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
usually involves a

537
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,159
natural written language uh with the

538
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,880
letters and words mixed up uh

539
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
substituted for others

540
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
jumbled around

541
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,279
a great way to start this is with

542
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,600
one of the most common

543
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
um

544
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,000
or well-known ciphers the caesar cipher

545
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,640
so this first question uh

546
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,039
named after a famous tragic quote

547
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,559
which may or may not actually have been

548
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,840
said

549
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
um

550
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
a

551
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
historians recently found an old stash

552
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,399
of ancient roman scrolls who

553
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,080
which appear to have been used for

554
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
military

555
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,480
communications

556
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,320
if

557
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,880
if you don't know

558
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
back in the days of the roman empire

559
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,559
julius caesar was

560
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,039
known for

561
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,000
a

562
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
sending

563
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
in cipher messages

564
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,960
to to and from his troops so that

565
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,120
the enemy couldn't intercept them

566
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
and the cypher that he used is called

567
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,960
the caesar cipher

568
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,279
um

569
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,760
the caesar cipher

570
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
involves

571
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
shifting

572
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
the letters of an alphabet

573
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
by a certain amount

574
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,720
so

575
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
give an example

576
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
let's just go over to decode

577
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
which is a great online tool

578
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,720
for a lot of things

579
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,159
and

580
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,279
let's see

581
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,080
what are we looking for

582
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,480
the caesar cipher

583
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,320
the way the caesar cipher works

584
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,440
is

585
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,679
um

586
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,559
say we have an alphabet

587
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,640
the for this is the english alphabet a b

588
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,279
c d x y z

589
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,880
um

590
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
and if we put in a message we'll say a

591
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,840
hello

592
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,320
um the way this will work

593
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,600
is

594
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,640
we go

595
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,399
uh if we want to

596
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,760
in cipher this message hello

597
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,000
we go letter by letter

598
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,279
we start with the first letter h

599
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,799
and

600
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,840
um

601
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,399
and we have to know the shift amount

602
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,200
in order to incite for it so

603
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
we'll just say one

604
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
we'll shift it by one for simplicity

605
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,720
and if we look at h in the alphabet

606
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,399
we're going to shift it

607
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,480
down the alphabet

608
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,960
so the letter that's right after it is i

609
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,039
so

610
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,880
h will be replaced with i

611
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,120
should be simple enough

612
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,640
uh

613
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,880
this is in decryption let me put this in

614
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,600
encryption and

615
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,559
we'll see if it actually works

616
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,039
and here we get an i in the first place

617
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,440
next letter is an f

618
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
if we look at e

619
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,320
the original plain text so to speak

620
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
the letter that comes right after e is f

621
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,840
which is in the ciphertext

622
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,440
so anyway

623
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
pretty uh

624
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
pretty simple cipher but if you don't

625
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,720
have a computer it can be difficult to

626
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,559
first you have to identify it then you

627
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,559
have to figure out how to crack it which

628
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,679
takes creativity and it takes

629
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,200
time and

630
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,679
lots of thought

631
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,960
so

632
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,320
going back to our challenge here

633
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
um

634
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,440
real quick

635
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,399
looking at the uh

636
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,519
format

637
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,679
of this string of characters here

638
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
can anyone tell me uh what kind of

639
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
attack

640
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,480
this uh cipher text would be vulnerable

641
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,480
to

642
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
it was something that

643
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,399
karen mentioned very recently and

644
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,840
the last question i believe

645
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,080
that's all right don't speak all at once

646
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,279
i'm talking about a uh known

647
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,880
uh

648
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,159
gnome plain text attack

649
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,279
so in our case

650
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,640
this looks

651
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
suspiciously

652
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,960
like the format of our string crypt

653
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,600
except with the letters

654
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
substituted

655
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,240
here we've got five letters in the

656
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,600
beginning

657
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,559
and then

658
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,440
an open bracket and a closed bracket so

659
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,519
let's go look at our let's copy this and

660
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,799
let's go look at our

661
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,360
cesar cipher

662
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,880
i go into here

663
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,679
and i look at f

664
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,039
so if f is the ciphertext

665
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,640
that means that something was shifted

666
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,799
down the alphabet to get to f

667
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,000
so if we want to go the opposite

668
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
direction we got to look up the alphabet

669
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,320
so we'll start at f

670
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,919
and

671
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,840
our expected output should be something

672
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,720
like

673
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,880
crypt

674
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,159
so if we go up from f

675
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,720
up to c that's e d c

676
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,760
that's three shifts

677
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,640
okay

678
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,720
maybe it's three shifts let's check the

679
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,159
next one

680
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,200
you

681
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,559
should decrypt

682
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,640
to r

683
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,080
so we'll look at

684
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,240
u

685
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,200
go up one two three

686
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
and it's r

687
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,639
okay

688
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,159
that's promising now let's use the

689
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,159
decrypter and

690
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,879
see what we get

691
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,599
and we get uh

692
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
something that's formatted as a flag

693
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,000
but it's not in english

694
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
now i wonder

695
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
yes the uh

696
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,280
the answer should be expressed in

697
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,639
english

698
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,119
so i mean it makes sense right the

699
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,119
ancient romans didn't speak english

700
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,079
why should the uh this ancient scroll be

701
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,079
in english so

702
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,119
i'll let you figure out uh how to

703
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,480
get the flag

704
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
hint

705
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,719
google tools

706
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,719
and

707
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,599
that's

708
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,960
that's basically the caesar cipher

709
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,720
uh any questions before i move on

710
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,160
nope all right

711
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,240
next we're going to move into a

712
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
different kind of cipher the

713
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,599
transposition cipher

714
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,720
so transposition is different from what

715
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,119
we just did which is substitution

716
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,119
substitution ciphers take letters of an

717
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,640
alphabet and replace them with other

718
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,680
letters transposition ciphers mix up the

719
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,079
letters

720
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,839
so

721
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,079
this challenge deals with a

722
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,079
transposition cipher called the

723
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,839
columnar transposition cipher

724
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,960
it works a little something like this

725
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,560
i'm gonna i'm gonna try something

726
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
everyone let's

727
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
let's see if it works out

728
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
uh start a new

729
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,040
screen share

730
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,920
can you all see a blank canvas

731
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,440
yes

732
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,040
okay cool

733
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
so

734
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,839
let's say

735
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,480
i want to in cipher a bit of text

736
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
handwriting

737
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,040
my

738
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,640
space

739
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,200
secret

740
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,960
space

741
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
letter

742
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,680
i want to incite for this message

743
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,599
process goes like this

744
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,599
first

745
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,040
say our transposition cipher has six

746
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
call uh

747
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
four columns

748
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,240
i'm going to

749
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,439
write the rows

750
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,720
here i'll make a little table

751
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,040
i'm going to write the rows

752
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,279
m

753
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,880
y

754
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
space

755
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,599
s

756
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,240
i guess the end i'll

757
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
write the next row

758
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,520
e

759
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,640
c

760
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,520
r

761
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,480
e

762
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,640
next row t

763
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,760
space

764
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,720
l

765
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,800
e next row

766
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,839
t

767
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,880
t

768
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,920
e

769
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,520
r

770
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,119
my secret letter

771
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,520
so that's a that makes a nice four by

772
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,320
four um

773
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,079
block basically

774
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,560
so that's the first step to

775
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,000
encoding

776
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,680
let's go down here

777
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,320
the second step is to mix up columns

778
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
so

779
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,880
i'm just gonna go ahead

780
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
and

781
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,000
i'll switch these two columns

782
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
to make it simple

783
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,160
so

784
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,079
make this a little smaller

785
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,680
that will be

786
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,359
space

787
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,520
r

788
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,040
l

789
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
e

790
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,720
and then

791
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,119
second of the change y c

792
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,240
space

793
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,680
t

794
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,280
third

795
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,560
m

796
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,359
e

797
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,240
t

798
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,960
t

799
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,119
and the second s

800
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,200
fourth s e e

801
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
r

802
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
so

803
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,520
this is our new

804
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,920
columnar cipher

805
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
so the second step is finished the last

806
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
step in

807
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,520
creating

808
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,200
the ciphertext

809
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
is we just read the columns

810
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,040
so we start

811
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,720
at the top left

812
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
and we go down

813
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,480
and when we get to the bottom we switch

814
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,760
to the second column and so on

815
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,839
so that is space

816
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,440
r

817
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,520
l e

818
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,400
y

819
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,119
c

820
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,520
space t

821
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,400
m

822
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,599
e t t

823
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,000
s e

824
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,040
e

825
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,839
r

826
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,560
and

827
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,599
there's your ciphertext

828
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,119
so

829
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,200
um the things you need to know to

830
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,599
decrypt this of course are the number of

831
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,839
columns

832
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,560
and

833
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,320
the permutation

834
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,160
the permutation of the columns in this

835
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,359
case

836
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,119
since we switched

837
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,520
columns one and three the order is

838
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,040
three

839
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,160
two

840
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,280
one

841
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
four

842
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,200
it will be one two three four if it

843
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,919
wasn't switched

844
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,920
so knowing all that now let's try to

845
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,839
decrypt this uh

846
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,960
string of text we found

847
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,560
up here says try deciphering let me

848
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,079
switch back to uh

849
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,440
we go

850
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,359
try deciphering the falling flag using

851
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,440
columnar transposition with this

852
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,319
permutation four two one okay

853
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,839
now i don't expect you to do this all on

854
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,079
paper like i did so let's go over to

855
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,640
decode

856
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,319
it why'd i type decode in there i'm

857
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,319
stupid

858
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,000
there we go

859
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,200
um

860
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,240
all right

861
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,720
so i've got the cipher in here

862
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
um i'm going to keep spaces and

863
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,319
punctuation

864
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,839
like we did

865
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,720
we put spaces into the columns

866
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,119
and mix them up on our own

867
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,400
and language is going to be english

868
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,560
the decryption key

869
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,359
i'll go ahead and copy into here

870
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,800
from our

871
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
answer

872
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,240
and looks like there's also a brute

873
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,799
force option

874
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
now with decode

875
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,839
of course

876
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,480
uh if you know the permutation key you

877
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,319
also know the number of columns because

878
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
it's just

879
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
how many numbers there are

880
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,119
so

881
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,720
looks like we've got everything we need

882
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,839
let's just decrypt it

883
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,839
and we get a flag in english

884
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,880
sweet

885
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,480
so bonus points to those of you who are

886
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,560
paying attention free flag

887
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
okay oh 11 50. time flies

888
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,920
um

889
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,960
i'm gonna run over to i'm gonna do

890
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,839
ruby off the rails

891
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,359
that would probably bring us to 12

892
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,200
o'clock

893
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,839
this is another transposition cipher

894
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,920
given the

895
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,160
content of the description and the name

896
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,280
of the challenge can anyone guess

897
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,280
what cipher i'm going to talk about now

898
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,119
you can throw it out there

899
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,400
don't have to you could be wrong it's

900
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,640
fine

901
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,400
okay well anyway it's uh

902
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,000
it's the rail fence cipher

903
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,880
the rail fence cipher

904
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,760
is another opportunity to

905
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,359
use a drawing use the drawing

906
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,799
tablet let me share

907
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,800
let me show you

908
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,359
how the rail fence cipher works

909
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,280
it's also transposition cipher so that

910
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,760
means we're just mixing up text

911
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,800
say i want to encrypt

912
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,760
my

913
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,560
secret

914
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,800
message

915
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,119
there's two things we need to know

916
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,440
your three it depends on how complicated

917
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,480
it is

918
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,319
the first thing you want to know

919
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,359
is the number of rails

920
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,480
let's just do three rails it's that

921
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,079
simple

922
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,720
and then

923
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,839
uh

924
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,000
second second thing you need to know is

925
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,280
uh

926
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,640
you're going to start on the top or

927
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
bottom

928
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,119
we'll start at the top

929
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,359
and then the last is the shift amount

930
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,160
which we won't worry about

931
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,400
just yet

932
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,800
but okay

933
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,160
so

934
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,720
to encrypt my secret message

935
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,040
we've got three rails

936
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,720
now we're going to

937
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,480
run this message across the rails

938
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,440
in a zigzag pattern

939
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,319
so

940
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,960
we need to start from the top so m is

941
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,400
going to

942
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,040
put m right here

943
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,880
um

944
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,119
i'll as well draw out the rails

945
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,880
one

946
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,839
two

947
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,079
three so it goes on the top rail

948
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,000
next one y

949
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,560
goes on the second rail

950
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,160
then we have a space

951
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,920
put on the third rail

952
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,839
once we hit the bottom

953
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,160
head back up

954
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
s on the second

955
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,240
e on the first

956
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,720
and so on

957
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,040
so now that we have

958
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,480
this zigzag zigzag pattern going on

959
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,440
um

960
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,599
we've written in a zigzag now we're

961
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,560
going to read the rails starting from

962
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
the top and going down

963
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,520
so first we've got m

964
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,319
then e

965
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,680
t

966
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,800
s

967
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,119
then we go to the next rail

968
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,640
y

969
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,440
s

970
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,240
c

971
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,200
e

972
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,440
m

973
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
[Music]

974
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,760
s

975
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,119
a

976
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,720
e

977
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,359
and the bottom

978
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,960
i think i forgot a space in here

979
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
actually whatever

980
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,000
space reg

981
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,599
looks like abstract reasoning

982
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,720
yep

983
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,040
um

984
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,119
it

985
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,200
it seems like a lot of these ciphers

986
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,280
were created by people who were just

987
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,920
bored and just were like hey what if

988
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,319
i have this crazy idea and no one's

989
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,480
gonna be able to guess it

990
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,599
which is kind of what i like about

991
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,119
obfuscation you can really let your

992
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,200
creativity flow

993
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,960
with it

994
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,200
so

995
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,839
that's the general

996
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,880
process say we want to decrypt

997
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
this message that was broken apart by a

998
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,640
train

999
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,520
running across it

1000
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,839
go ahead go to

1001
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,079
decode again because

1002
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,880
it's a good site

1003
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,960
and the

1004
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,800
cipher's called rail fence or zigzag

1005
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,720
so like before we're keeping punctuation

1006
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,640
in spaces

1007
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,119
the alphabet doesn't really matter

1008
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,839
mixing up all the characters

1009
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,800
number of rows we've got is three

1010
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,680
we're going to start from the top left

1011
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
let's do the bottom

1012
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,839
and the offset we mentioned before

1013
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,800
uh you know it has to do with

1014
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
maybe to make it more complicated you

1015
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,599
start on the middle rail or you start on

1016
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,280
the third rail

1017
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,280
that's what the offset is

1018
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,200
but we've got no and offset this time

1019
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,040
we'll decrypt it

1020
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,079
and

1021
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,760
it writes out

1022
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,079
it shows you the rails

1023
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,720
and the message

1024
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,680
i don't know if any of you have ever put

1025
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,920
a penny on a trolley track

1026
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,839
uh but it flattens it out it's pretty

1027
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,078
cool

1028
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,599
i've never done it before but

1029
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,319
we should get some day

1030
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
this makes sense to everyone

1031
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,680
we're almost out of time

1032
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,119
so i'll point you towards columns rails

1033
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,200
uh given i just talked about you should

1034
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,839
be able to do that just

1035
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:37,200
fine it'll be a bit more challenging

1036
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,920
and

1037
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,720
i suggest you also look at

1038
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,959
the

1039
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,359
vegan airy cipher

1040
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,960
i don't know how to pronounce that i'm

1041
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,000
sorry

1042
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,040
it's a more advanced cipher um it's

1043
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,680
closer to a one-time pad i feel

1044
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
um

1045
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,559
than

1046
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,760
just a simple key

1047
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,599
and you can look at that in your own

1048
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,599
time

1049
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,640
fijian air

1050
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,079
thanks jordan like vision there

1051
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,880
but like i said i'm not french so

1052
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,559
still be butchering it

1053
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,160
i mean i've heard people just say

1054
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,839
vinaigrette and i'm like no

1055
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
that's something i wouldn't start saying

1056
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,240
that i think

1057
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,040
i just remembered

1058
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,970
vinaigrette lemon vinegar

1059
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,410
[Laughter]

1060
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,240
i just remembered uh

1061
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,559
one more challenge i put in here that's

1062
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,720
uh unrelated to the others somewhat

1063
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,119
there's one challenge that

1064
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,280
substitutes all the letters

1065
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,200
uh randomly using a random alphabet

1066
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,440
see if you can crack that one

1067
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,680
um

1068
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,839
it's a bit of a

1069
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,359
that might be a little challenging but

1070
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,119
any hint to figure out the permutations

1071
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,680
for column transposition in columns and

1072
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,200
rails

1073
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,520
okay

1074
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,439
well

1075
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,319
looks like there's

1076
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,200
no permutations mentioned so maybe you

1077
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,160
can try that first

1078
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,760
columnar transposition doesn't need to

1079
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,920
have permutations

1080
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,880
i notice usually in ctfs when i don't

1081
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,119
mention crucial information

1082
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,400
sometimes it's

1083
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,559
just using the default standard

1084
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,439
thanks nestor

1085
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,359
it was fun making these challenges it is

1086
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,720
noon our time thank you max

1087
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,319
for uh awesomely showing us how to

1088
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,480
solve more challenges and using your pad

1089
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,920
there

1090
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,720
i think that was a great idea for this

1091
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,559
uh just like we did

1092
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,240
a little while ago we'll take a five

1093
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
minute break if you have questions on

1094
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,559
other categories that we haven't now is

1095
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,200
the time to ask away

1096
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,800
or if you want to take a quick bio break

1097
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,839
that's fine too

1098
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,040
so in in five minutes we'll have the

1099
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,559
next round

1100
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,720
of questions

1101
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,800
so

1102
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,760
is that totally random one supposed to

1103
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,240
be uh

1104
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,680
our laura case or capitalized

1105
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,759
it looks like it's all lower case

1106
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,240
there are

1107
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,479
um

1108
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,480
spaces in between

1109
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,200
things that are used with the underscore

1110
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,559
our spaces are represented with

1111
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,520
underscore there we go

1112
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,720
[Music]

1113
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,200
but all the uh capitals are supposed to

1114
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,160
be lowercased

1115
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,680
yes

1116
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,000
oh hang on sorry i was looking at them

1117
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,160
um the capital state capitals the

1118
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,079
lowercase stay lowercase yeah my

1119
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,599
apologies i was definitely looking at

1120
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,599
the wrong challenge flag

1121
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,559
i'm sorry about that

1122
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,839
it happens

1123
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,200
um

1124
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,920
okay

1125
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,480
uh 1205 our time

1126
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,640
we'll do another 30 minutes

1127
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,040
i'd like to introduce to you one of our

1128
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,400
team leads

1129
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,720
and also the person who created this

1130
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,680
idea of making a crypto ctf

1131
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,680
jordan

1132
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,040
thank you irvin uh hi everyone um great

1133
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,119
to be here again um

1134
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,040
i'm going to

1135
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,359
let's see walk through a couple of bits

1136
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,559
and bones category so

1137
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,359
i um

1138
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,400
let's see i i find that approaching some

1139
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,640
cryptography problems are

1140
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,000
pretty fun when using python so i'll

1141
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,440
kind of go over a couple of these

1142
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,680
questions and then i'm primarily going

1143
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,880
to

1144
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,880
use python to help

1145
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,040
work through a couple of these so we

1146
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,319
have

1147
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,880
on the

1148
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,359
page here you know your

1149
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,000
link and guide to replit um we didn't

1150
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,520
assume that people

1151
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,280
have python installed on their machines

1152
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,839
but we're going to be using python3

1153
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,319
and there's also a link here to some of

1154
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,720
the

1155
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,200
collections that are particularly useful

1156
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,839
when solving uh cryptography problems

1157
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,559
with python so

1158
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,040
primary like primary focus is pwntools

1159
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,200
and pi crypto dome but you can still

1160
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,599
solve some of these things without even

1161
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,520
using those collections

1162
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,599
so

1163
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,079
yeah we'll get started so the first um i

1164
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,240
thought this category was particularly

1165
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
important because um

1166
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,359
you know like irvin said at the

1167
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,400
beginning

1168
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,520
the idea of this cryptography

1169
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,160
introduction is to sort of not focus so

1170
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,440
much on

1171
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,240
the math concepts which are

1172
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,000
admitted like obviously very important

1173
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,400
but there's a lot of logic as well that

1174
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,000
comes in so i thought it would be cool

1175
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,040
to

1176
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,319
you know sort of tie in some of the

1177
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,400
logic truth tables and you know

1178
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,319
understanding how those work

1179
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,680
with bit

1180
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,799
and bit operations and you know

1181
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,520
under the hood

1182
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,040
we're always just working with bits and

1183
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
bytes right and so we have these great

1184
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,720
tools we have programming language we

1185
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,960
have security tools that abstract all

1186
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,119
these things away but under the hood it

1187
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,640
does just come down to the zeros and

1188
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,400
ones um

1189
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,280
and so

1190
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,799
i added in a couple of these challenge

1191
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,280
we um begin with the logical and

1192
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,319
operator

1193
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,680
and if you're not familiar with truth

1194
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,000
tables um definitely check out this

1195
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,559
wikipedia link it's pretty prevalent and

1196
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,799
like um

1197
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,799
boolean arithmetic which we see quite a

1198
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,440
bit with computers as well so and if you

1199
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,079
are not a math person that's totally

1200
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,240
okay this isn't these are math concepts

1201
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,599
but it's a little bit different it's not

1202
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,040
something like

1203
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,880
algebra or calculus you know it's sort

1204
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,760
of its own set of math and like

1205
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,440
discrete math or finite math so

1206
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,119
for people who are not math people this

1207
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,119
could be your kind of math so

1208
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,640
anyway um

1209
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,640
moving into this bitwise and operator

1210
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,720
compares two equal length binary

1211
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,119
representations basically if the two

1212
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,200
bits are the same

1213
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,240
or if the two bits are different

1214
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,280
excuse me

1215
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,839
um

1216
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,400
if both both bits

1217
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,720
in the compared position are one it

1218
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,799
outputs one so basically if both bits

1219
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,799
are one that's the only time we output

1220
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,799
one

1221
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,240
and um

1222
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,280
okay

1223
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,599
getting sidetracked by some chat okay so

1224
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,520
what we're going to do is basically just

1225
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,839
open up a terminal i'm going to interact

1226
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,160
with our python 3

1227
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,200
shell

1228
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,879
and so what we can see here is

1229
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,640
most languages use this and operator so

1230
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,799
it's pretty simple to begin with this we

1231
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,480
can type in we're going to perform

1232
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,400
bitwise and on 167 and 197. so these are

1233
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,880
just right now uh integer representation

1234
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,599
so

1235
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,599
we can pretty much just type in at the

1236
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,040
line

1237
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,880
this so

1238
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,240
the interesting thing is is

1239
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,440
when we are working with bit operations

1240
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,319
um

1241
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,920
you know we're not always

1242
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,119
presented the data in binary and so

1243
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,720
sometimes we're given decimal integers

1244
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,240
sometimes we're given hexadecimal

1245
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,880
representation so the idea is is that we

1246
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,040
always want to kind of convert from

1247
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,040
whatever representation and we are

1248
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,799
currently in to something that can be

1249
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:08,240
used or basically transform it to binary

1250
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,400
binary representation

1251
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,079
with python some of these things are

1252
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,920
abstracted away so we don't necessarily

1253
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,000
have to go all the way down to binary um

1254
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,880
as you can see here we get basically the

1255
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,280
um

1256
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,480
output what we can do though is get a

1257
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,119
binary representation of 167 we can get

1258
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,079
a binary representation of 197

1259
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,680
and then basically what we can do is bit

1260
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,359
by bit

1261
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,160
compare these

1262
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,799
values and then

1263
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,359
from there we can come up with the

1264
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,240
final representation so we'll go back to

1265
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,559
just 167 and 197.

1266
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,559
so we have this value but

1267
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,200
we need to convert to hexadecimal so

1268
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,359
what we have here is we can basically

1269
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,920
i'll i will do it element by element but

1270
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,359
i won't do it all like i said it's

1271
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:00,880
pretty straightforward once you kind of

1272
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,079
see

1273
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,160
the different functions that python

1274
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,400
provides so we'll have

1275
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,920
hexadecimal

1276
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,280
so we can see

1277
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,119
what that how that value is represented

1278
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,160
and we can do 197 as well

1279
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,720
and then what you can start doing is

1280
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,359
nesting a few of these things so we can

1281
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,400
take

1282
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,640
um

1283
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,319
something like this 1 67

1284
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,400
167 there we go

1285
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,760
and 197

1286
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:32,839
hey

1287
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,839
voila so we get a hexadecimal

1288
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,920
representation of 85.

1289
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,480
so that's

1290
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,839
bitwise and um you know just easy

1291
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,880
introduction um

1292
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,640
and a flag for you if you've been paying

1293
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,799
attention so

1294
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,680
what i will do is continue on so let's

1295
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,000
see we've got flip a bit which is

1296
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,280
all of these are going to be bitwise

1297
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,599
operators within bits and bones

1298
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:00,839
um

1299
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,119
or challenges that deal with bitwise

1300
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,160
operations so bitwise knot is just a

1301
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,280
negator it's pretty straightforward um

1302
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,280
what i would recommend for this

1303
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,880
challenge is maybe doing it by hand

1304
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,559
for some of these things

1305
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,400
i would encourage you to practice doing

1306
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,359
by hand i know um

1307
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,400
some of these

1308
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,240
challenges take less time to do it by

1309
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,799
hand so what we can do is basically just

1310
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:27,960
see what

1311
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,000
65537 looks like in binary

1312
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,680
right yeah python is pretty great for

1313
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,039
some of these quick

1314
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,440
crypto like cryptography just like need

1315
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,280
to rail out

1316
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,680
some scripts pretty quick it's it's been

1317
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,119
quite a bit of fun

1318
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,039
so um as we can see here with the truth

1319
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:45,920
table

1320
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,160
basically like i said you negate so if

1321
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,559
the bit that's coming in is a zero we

1322
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,720
switch we flip it to one

1323
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,680
and so

1324
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,559
we see our binary representation here

1325
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,319
so what we can do is basically just

1326
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,000
write out

1327
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,880
the flipped bits and

1328
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,559
with this

1329
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,680
challenge

1330
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,480
we don't want to drop any bits um

1331
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,400
there is the

1332
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,240
you know representation or there's that

1333
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,119
idea of like if you have zeros at the

1334
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,280
left the far left side has zeros those

1335
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,960
are dropped sometimes but in this

1336
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,559
challenge we keep all of them

1337
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,039
okay

1338
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,839
moving on

1339
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,280
okay exclusive or so this is admittedly

1340
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,400
um

1341
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,440
become one of the most common

1342
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,039
operations that i've seen in

1343
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,720
cryptography

1344
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,400
i joke with a friend that cryptography

1345
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,079
is basically xor and large primes so

1346
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,280
this is arguably i think one of the most

1347
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,799
important concepts so exclusive or um

1348
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,559
again another bitwise

1349
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,079
operation

1350
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,920
return zero if the bits are the same and

1351
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,160
one otherwise so i like to think of this

1352
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,599
like i don't know if

1353
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,200
people if there's an olive garden around

1354
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,160
you guys

1355
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,680
but you know they have that like soup

1356
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,520
salad deal

1357
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,920
and you can either get soup or salad but

1358
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,160
you can't get both and why would you not

1359
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,160
get either one if that's what if that's

1360
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,760
the deal you're going for

1361
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,200
so it's the same kind of thing you have

1362
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,440
to have one or the other but not both

1363
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,119
and not neither

1364
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,119
so

1365
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,119
uh

1366
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,680
so python has um

1367
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,559
within most programming languages

1368
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,599
um xor is denoted with

1369
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,119
the carrot

1370
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,599
and textbooks that's the circle with the

1371
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,760
cross through it and

1372
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,400
we can do is let's see

1373
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,319
perform it's kind of similar

1374
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,359
to

1375
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,319
the previous um operators where you can

1376
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,480
kind of at this point python will still

1377
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,640
abstract away some of these details of

1378
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,079
you know moving it down to binary or

1379
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,160
backup and so we can do a pretty

1380
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,680
straightforward

1381
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,400
xor operation just from

1382
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,599
the shell

1383
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,319
and similarly what we want to do is wrap

1384
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,839
this in the hex method

1385
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,960
to reach the desired output

1386
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,440
representation

1387
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,520
a voila

1388
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,200
so pretty swift

1389
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,280
pretty quick that's the fun part of this

1390
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,680
and um i'm showing these in python now

1391
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,079
but python is not the only

1392
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,520
language i'm i wouldn't say that

1393
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,880
this is like the best language to

1394
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,160
approach some of these cryptography

1395
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,000
problems if they think it's specific to

1396
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,200
the problem

1397
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,839
um so by no means am i saying this is

1398
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,240
like the best way to do it but as far as

1399
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,039
i found um as a student it's been

1400
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,559
pretty fun working through some of these

1401
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,119
things with python so

1402
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,240
uh

1403
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,359
yeah okay so i'll work through

1404
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,680
one more and then from there i think you

1405
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,039
should have enough to be able to

1406
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,280
complete the rest of the challenges

1407
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,800
below so let me pull up a little

1408
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,160
[Music]

1409
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,160
okay so with this one

1410
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,319
we want to encrypt the string electric

1411
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,200
feel with the integer seven the flag as

1412
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,240
a cipher text as a 12 character string

1413
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,079
so there's a couple ways to approach

1414
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,520
this problem um i personally have been

1415
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,200
using what are called list

1416
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,760
comprehensions pretty regularly with

1417
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,240
these problems just because it's uh kind

1418
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,520
of compact and

1419
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,760
quick to find uh

1420
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,839
quick to come up with the solution but

1421
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,760
what i will do is

1422
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,079
work through it a little bit more slowly

1423
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,200
so

1424
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,640
we can start out

1425
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,599
because i'm still in my python shell so

1426
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,880
we want the

1427
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,359
we want to set the key to the integer

1428
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,119
7.

1429
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,359
and what we're going to do is basically

1430
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,359
perform some operations on this electric

1431
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,000
field string and put it into a new list

1432
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,039
and

1433
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,400
smush it all together to make the new

1434
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,280
string so i'm going to call new string

1435
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,799
as such

1436
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,440
and create a little empty list and so

1437
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,680
what we'll do is

1438
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,839
the idea when we have

1439
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,960
strings is that we need to convert each

1440
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,720
character of the string to an integer

1441
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,039
representation of that character

1442
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,599
so python they have a neat function

1443
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:14,720
called ord

1444
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,759
and basically it just um

1445
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,000
spits out the ordinal representation and

1446
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
unicode of that character

1447
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,920
so it's great and it also there's

1448
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,679
another function that works in

1449
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,920
conjunction with that chr

1450
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,520
and basically you can switch back and

1451
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,120
forth from character and ordinal

1452
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,600
representations using those two um

1453
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,000
functions which you will see quite a bit

1454
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,158
if you have any interest in cryptography

1455
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,399
and want to continue on some of the like

1456
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:41,839
uh

1457
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,279
you know from peeling away some of the

1458
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,279
abstraction this is definitely something

1459
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,600
you will continue to come across so um

1460
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,640
so the idea is to

1461
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,238
isolate each

1462
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,279
character

1463
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,319
convert it to an integer representation

1464
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,040
we'll perform the bitwise operation and

1465
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,479
then basically convert it back to a

1466
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:03,679
string

1467
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:04,479
so

1468
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,359
we'll start with our for loop for x in

1469
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,000
electric field we need to tab over so

1470
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,960
ord value is going to equal

1471
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,399
ord of x

1472
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,040
and x uh for x in electric field

1473
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,479
basically what that does is we'll just

1474
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,679
cycle through each letter of this string

1475
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:22,640
so

1476
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,920
we'll continue with that um

1477
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,679
i'm not going to

1478
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,799
print

1479
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,080
a bunch of

1480
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,040
um you know in my

1481
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,679
at home it might be wise to go ahead and

1482
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,679
do some like sort of debugging and say

1483
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,198
i'm going to print out this value and

1484
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,479
just make sure that everything's coming

1485
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,399
through but i don't think that's totally

1486
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,920
necessary um

1487
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,759
so what we're going to do is now that we

1488
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,238
have each character isolated or each

1489
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,799
character at a time isolated and it's

1490
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,640
ord value what we need to do is xor it

1491
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,238
with the key

1492
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,679
so we're going to have xor with key

1493
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,600
equals

1494
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,199
we're going to have our ord

1495
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,560
value and then remember the upper or the

1496
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,920
um

1497
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,640
symbol used to denote xor and python is

1498
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,640
the carrot so we're going to xor with

1499
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,239
the key

1500
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,640
and then we will continue down

1501
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,840
and then our return

1502
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,600
character is going to be

1503
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,360
x

1504
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,239
you want to convert back to character

1505
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:29,120
and then xor

1506
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,760
with key

1507
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,480
and then what we need to do is so like i

1508
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,480
said we're we're cycling through one

1509
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,000
character at a time so what we're going

1510
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,760
to do is shove those characters back

1511
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,840
into the new string list that we created

1512
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,800
at the top

1513
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,199
so new string append

1514
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,960
return

1515
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,480
character

1516
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,280
and then from here we want to print the

1517
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,400
new

1518
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,719
string

1519
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,840
where do we go line

1520
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,120
six you know i actually have this right

1521
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,159
here so what we can do is

1522
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,280
nano xor dot py

1523
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,760
oh actually we need x out of this

1524
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,960
nano

1525
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,480
jordan i think you forgot a closed

1526
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,560
parenthesis on your return

1527
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,000
yeah that's okay

1528
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,760
it's probably just bigger to do it this

1529
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,040
way

1530
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,280
um

1531
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,320
because then i'd have to cycle back up

1532
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,640
and type everything out again so

1533
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,840
right yeah

1534
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,360
here we go

1535
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,600
oh right because i forgot to

1536
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,120
add and key at the top

1537
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,080
okay so this is what i was trying to

1538
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,719
avoid before is the uh

1539
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,040
breakdown of each character so

1540
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,679
um we'll just move down to the string so

1541
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:50,400
basically what we are returned

1542
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,679
or what is returned is each value

1543
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,560
converted to its ordinal

1544
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,679
representation xord with seven and then

1545
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,600
converted back to its character

1546
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,040
representation

1547
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,400
and then what you can do here is some

1548
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,400
other python code to

1549
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,760
join this back together and make it a

1550
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,560
nice easy string but that's not relevant

1551
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,600
right now

1552
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,040
so i will so that's kind of long way or

1553
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,640
not long way it's a

1554
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,880
very readable way to

1555
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,239
um

1556
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,960
convert this uh

1557
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,360
or to encrypt this but what i will also

1558
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,840
show for

1559
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,679
folks who are interested in

1560
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,960
um

1561
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,800
list comprehension because i think it's

1562
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,880
quite a bit oh we need to do key first

1563
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,000
key equals seven it's pretty swift

1564
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,080
um but less readable so you know there

1565
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,600
always is that balance

1566
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,880
okay for x10

1567
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,280
okay how does that look

1568
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:58,080
yep parentheses are together so

1569
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,760
a voila

1570
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,480
so

1571
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,280
basically a list comprehension is a

1572
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,800
smooshed for loop

1573
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,280
so we have 4x an electric field

1574
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,360
do all these things and then return it

1575
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,679
as a list and then we can also do a join

1576
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,520
a voila

1577
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,679
so uh yeah i think as of right now

1578
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,320
that should definitely set you up

1579
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,280
for

1580
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,360
um

1581
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,480
future challenges let's see we're

1582
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,239
basically kind of continuing through and

1583
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,040
then

1584
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,400
um

1585
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,400
you know some of these are combinations

1586
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,719
of operators so

1587
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,920
oh there we go cool

1588
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,280
all right any questions i know i just

1589
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,000
went through quite a bit of python

1590
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,679
stuff so we just dove in

1591
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,440
oh

1592
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,440
well

1593
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,480
um

1594
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,760
thank you jordan

1595
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,640
i think the last uh 40 minutes

1596
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,600
or so will open up for questions

1597
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,840
so if you want us to

1598
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,320
demonstrate a specific question now

1599
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,640
would be the time

1600
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,320
or if you're stuck on a question please

1601
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,640
ask away but we will be here

1602

if you need any help

1604
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,280
i guess i'll mention a shout out to sir

though as long as we're not doing

1871
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,400
something on youtube where it detects

1872
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,320
the music and it decides to shut off the

1873
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,400
stream

1874
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,600

1879
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,639
you know your camera over to

1880
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:27,760
or whatever

1881
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,480
or even webex or whatever

1882
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,840
yeah

1883
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,840
well webex may not be the most musically

1884
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,400
inclined

1885
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,120
now i think streaming on just straight

1886
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,320
on discord

1887
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,080
that stuff would be fine

1888
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:46,320
and hey we don't get to see dj raw soda

1889
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,520
i don't even know after code where all

1890
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,199
my conference recording equipment is

1891
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,560
oh that's true

1892
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,120
that sterling was the the original

1893
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,719
recorder

1894
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,040
of uh of the first two conferences too

1895
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,199
you did the second two or nine i don't

1896
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:08,400
think you did the same thing the first

1897
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,920
pacific characters i've done more

1898
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,199
headphones than pacific hackers

1899
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,360
so they all have an excuse to fly out

1900
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,210
there now

1901
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:20,740
[Laughter]

1902
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,040
any excuse to justify having a security

1903
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,199
asserts at the moment it's it's fun

1904
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,760
but that's that's the way employment

1905
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,120
goes

1906
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,320
right

1907
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,960
i have to make a nice uh pelican case

1908
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,639
for the mixer and all the stuff

1909
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,000
you truly gonna put djs that day

1910
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,800
no no

1911
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,639
how how we're gonna do that i know that

1912
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,840
we've done this before i know i know

1913
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,199
i was gonna do

1914
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,159
just a camera and

1915
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,080
a microphone

1916
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,080
or a second microphone

1917
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,280
for the

1918
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,159
speak for the background for the speaker

1919
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,760
at the

1920
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,600
at the table if so if someone wants to

1921
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,040
do a fire talk

1922
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,320
we could

1923
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,320
we could probably broadcast that you

1924
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,440
know

1925
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,000
but going to

1926
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,520
you know

1927
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,960
there's going to be a lockpick village

1928
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,040
table there's going to be you you fly

1929
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
messing around with the drone and no

1930
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,080
quarter

1931
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,400
you know so a bunch of other things we

1932
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,600
could probably

1933
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,360
do a couple but we'll have i don't have

1934
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,520
that many types of cameras or remote

1935
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,440
cameras to like

1936
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,520
well we had the drone well we had the

1937
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,920
drone flying um

1938
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,480
and people trying to take it down

1939
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,239
that would be like a good thing to

1940
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,080
film i'm taking a small drum to um

1941
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,639
to california it's a it's a pocket drum

1942
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,120
but there is an exploit for it

1943
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,199
so if you have the right

1944
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:56,560
tool you can actually land it and put it

1945
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,280
and

1946
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,960
take it up

1947
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,000
make it take off

1948
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,239
is it like one of these little guys or

1949
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:06,080
like yeah they're nano drones we can't

1950
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:06,960
fly

1951
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,159
over than that then we're gonna have to

1952
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,080
ask for permission

1953
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,000
you know that you're supposed to have

1954
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,480
that dual what's it called um before you

1955
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,000
fly

1956
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,960
uh

1957
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,679
and if you're close of of any airport

1958
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:22,400
stuff you can even fly that

1959
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,360
well i know some of the drone the

1960
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,159
like the mavericks and stuff

1961
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,120
like

1962
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,239
they're

1963
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,159
they have like built-in gps sensors and

1964
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,239
they'll say oh like

1965
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,480
you can't go over a certain altitude

1966
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,480
here and you can't go any further to

1967
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,080
closer to this

1968
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,800
radius of uh like we're trying to fly a

1969
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,800
drone we're flying the drone around the

1970
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,159
office

1971
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,000
over in downtown in downtown fort

1972
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,320
lauderdale it was in uh

1973
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,719
the maverick was like oh can't go over

1974
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,880
there it has a big red zone

1975
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,880
because of the uh

1976
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,480
you know the prison

1977
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,760
right there

1978
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,719
right

1979
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,320
or the courthouse as well you know

1980
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,840
hmm

1981
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,239
you can however go into you could have

1982
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:14,000
gone to the top

1983
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,400
of your building and fly it from there

1984
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,639
which which then would have gotten you

1985
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:21,760
into another sort of trouble

1986
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,920
could have gone to we

1987
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,440
flew the drone from

1988
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,560
from there you know and just went up and

1989
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,920
just looked around

1990
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,520
right

1991
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,000
what i wanted to do to be honest um i

1992
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,239
got the drone that

1993
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:37,920
is fixed wing

1994
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,080
and i wanted to do what this guy did in

1995
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,960
hawaii he flew it from one island to the

1996
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,400
other using a 5g modern

1997
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,559
and i wanted to fly it from homestead

1998
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,040
but it's impossible there's so many

1999
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,480
no-fly zones forget about it

2000
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,639
yeah i don't even think you could go

2001
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,960
through

2002
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,440
you can't even go

2003
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,719
through the turnpike right or fly over

2004
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:07,520
right

2005
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,800
unless you're like

2006
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,880
wait there no because you have mia and

2007
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,440
then you have right homestead air force

2008
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,400
base

2009
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,280
you have all kinds of executive airports

2010
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,560
you can't fly anywhere near that

2011
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,719
your park you almost held the event at

2012
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,040
was just at the edge of the air approach

2013
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,840
to one of the airports

2014
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,560
for drone prohibitions

2015
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,960
hmm

2016
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,199
so what type of radio do we need to take

2017
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,360
down one of these little guys

2018
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,800
you need you just need a is that wi-fi

2019
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,520
no this is just one of these little rf

2020
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,080
rfs you say um

2021
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,880
i'm assuming we can use a uh what's it

2022
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,000
called

2023
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,520
a hacker

2024
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,080
we can use a hacker f and record record

2025
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,719
the uh transmission

2026
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,320
and try to replay it

2027
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,400
or jam it but i don't think hacker if

2028
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,040
has jamming capabilities

2029
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,719
if you have the um

2030
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,960
no if you have the havoc

2031
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,719
and the porter pack you could probably i

2032
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:17,360
have that i have that i have the hack rf

2033
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,600
i just don't have the porter pack

2034
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,440
i had the border pack with the havoc

2035
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,400
yeah

2036
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,080
yeah so

2037
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,000
you can do that is that how you did the

2038
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,320
um

2039
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:32,239
which one is that the ptf over in las

2040
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,520
vegas

2041
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,320
no that one was a telnet

2042
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,960
oh okay i don't need it

2043
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,440
and i read the manual of the drone and i

2044
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,960
just put the

2045
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,960
shutdown so i should i shut it down in

2046
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,520
the air and the thing went down

2047
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,280
ah it was one of those i thought it was

2048
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,000
um well you have 45 seconds to take it

2049
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,440
down

2050
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,679
but the drone was in the but but the

2051
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,840
drone was connected to wi-fi to so that

2052
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,880
you could actually

2053
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,800
connect it to a terminal and and the

2054
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,960
drone had a chain

2055
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,840
so you wouldn't fly it against the wall

2056
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,840
or against the roof

2057
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,000
yeah they give you 45 seconds

2058
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,679
in 45 seconds you have to take the drone

2059
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,440
down

2060
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,239
um

2061
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,560
so if you don't know the commands if you

2062
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,639
don't know the commands you you will be

2063
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,639
typing stuff and nothing will happen

2064
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:26,880
oh we should probably show how to

2065
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,199
oh here's the wi-fi

2066
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,119
here's the hack rf

2067
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,320
it the remote control is that uh i can

2068
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,280
take my my havoc i have the hacker f

2069
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,360
with the havoc

2070
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,119
let's see if we can you should take that

2071
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:42,960
drum man

2072
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,600
yeah i'm gonna take this drone

2073
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,040
and take the dji nano the dji nano is

2074
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,960
pretty good and it flies very well

2075
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,400
internally

2076
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,840
uh on inside uh indoors and it can be

2077
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,119
taken down it's over wi-fi

2078
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:02,159
oh wow if it's over wi-fi

2079
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,320
yeah i also have a power that i was able

2080
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,639
to fly over a mile and a half on wi-fi

2081
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,239
yeah but this is like only 30 dollars

2082
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,320
it's like a 30 dollar drone

2083
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:17,920
yeah like can you even keep it steady

2084
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,199
this one this one has uh auto this one

2085
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,199
has a good hover it has a good hover

2086
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,440
where you could just

2087
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,880
if you tether it

2088
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,600
yeah

2089
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,360
with a loose tether it'll stay in a

2090
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,280
certain area you know

2091
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,239
so it won't fly against anything

2092
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,800
it has like a the batteries are

2093
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,040
interchangeable and they're like

2094
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,360
fit like at least five six

2095
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,670
ten minute batteries

2096
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:45,600
[Music]

2097
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,400
no i have a lot of batteries so

2098
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,280
we can have it fly in a long time

2099
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,880
oh yeah

2100
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,480
let's see if i can pick up another one

2101
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,840
uh

2102
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,199
yeah

2103
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,920
well my my drones are wi-fi so that's

2104
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,520
the that's the tool that they're gonna

2105
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,119
have to use and how to use wi-fi they

2106
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,440
can jam it if you jam it

2107
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,679
it will use return to home

2108
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,440
um

2109
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,000
uh or you can actually tell well the

2110
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,480
tool will telnet into it and you can

2111
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,119
sort of execute commands

2112
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:20,080
what i want to get into is this uh

2113
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,679
i haven't been able to mess around with

2114
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:23,840
this kerberos

2115
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,040
sdr since i want it

2116
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,880
and this has been on my shelf and i've

2117
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,440
been like dying to like start

2118
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,600
find some antennas for this sucker and

2119
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,239
mess around with drawing

2120
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,679
you see but yeah

2121
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,280
you can use that to jam that little

2122
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,679
drone you just need the antennas in the

2123
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,360
the software

2124
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,719
yeah you just need the antennas the

2125
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:47,760
software but you need to

2126
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,199
but this you can use to triangulate

2127
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,280
uh other

2128
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,320
radio frequency uh radios

2129
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,880
right and not

2130
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:03,040
and locate the radio transmissions

2131
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,600
pretty

2132
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,840

uh everyone's gonna start putting in all

2158
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,960
their flags they've been uh

2159
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,560
they've just been holding them back

2160
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,560
they've been holding the whole time and

2161
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,600
i'm in trouble black hoarding

2162
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,960
yeah

2163
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,280
i mean

2164
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,800
there's a lot of guys

2165
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,119
how do you feel about that strategy in

2166
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:08,400
ctf's flag hoarding

2167
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,239
why are they bent

2168
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,280
sometimes it doesn't

2169
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,440
it depends sometimes it could go bad too

2170
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,679
if you don't have if you mistyped that

2171
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,280
flag then you're trying to resolve that

2172
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,159
problem again to try to fix the flag

2173
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:24,960
right

2174
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,560
and you don't have fine

2175
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,639
i need to start playing different ctfs

2176
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:30,800
because chances are i'm so used to rods

2177
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,480
i'd lose it anybody else's

2178
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,960
yeah that's why i constantly promote ctf

2179
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,159
time

2180
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:41,840
and tell our the participants of our

2181
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,840
competitions program to play as many

2182
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,400
ctfs as they want i don't care about

2183
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,320
them winning it's just getting them

2184
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,119
exposed to various etfs so they see

2185
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,119
different people and how they make uh

2186
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:54,560
various games

2187
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,800
right

2188
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,719
is that that's the way to go so you guys

2189
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,880
designed the platform here

2190
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,560
yes we built it from the ground up

2191
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:09,040
nice

2192
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,480
because i hope you're at least blogging

2193
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,159
everyone's bad answer so you have an

2194
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,839
idea how people got things wrong

2195
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,320
i believe we are the backend team has

2196
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,440
been watching everything

2197
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,320
i think you should move the questions

2198
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,480
section to the

2199
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,199
center and move the tools you know

2200
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:40,239
switch

2201
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:43,440
swap the two panels so the the reason

2202
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,119
why it's like that is uh

2203
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,639
the

2204
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:49,840
end goal

2205
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,639
is really in the middle or most of the

2206
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,840
screen to be taken up by a virtual

2207
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,360
machine because a lot of the students

2208
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,199
that we serve have nothing but a

2209
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:00,400
chromebook

2210
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,320
and can't do anything on them

2211
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,000
so we provide them with a virtual

2212
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,520
machine and through the browser that

2213
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,600
they can do everything

2214
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,679
and we're actually in process of

2215
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:11,360
deploying that part

2216
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,520
so the the way the the

2217
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,760
games would work from then on would be

2218
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,080
after you create a a account and get

2219
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,000
into the game you would be presented

2220
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,199
with with a a complete desktop

2221
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:26,719
and then the questions on the side

2222
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
uh have you seen the

2223
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,159
i think that

2224
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:36,000
there's something similar to that with

2225
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,480
phone college has something similar to

2226
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,960
that as well

2227
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,920
i'm not familiar

2228
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:48,560
[Music]

2229
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:53,080
let me see if i can find the link

2230
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,800
or they they provide you a terminal into

2231
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,719
uh

2232
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,280
into the where the challenge questions

2233
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,440
are

2234
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,199
yeah we think similar to that and

2235
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,440
actually as we were discussing

2236
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:19,679
while doing this we're thinking of

2237
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,040
this setup

2238
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,040
of making like iframes where when you

2239
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,320
click the button instead of taking it to

2240
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,239
a new tab it opens up

2241
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:27,199
that

2242
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,119
uh that thing you clicked on there so

2243
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:30,960
you're not you're not going in and out

2244
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,639
of different tabs

2245
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,679
but again our our main focus are those

2246
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:37,199
underprivileged students who all they

2247
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:39,760
have is a school issued chromebook

2248
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,000
yeah

2249
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,199
no it's a great idea

2250
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,840
you

2251
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,320
oh there is the metasploit ctf also

2252
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,239
going on this weekend right

2253
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:34,960
yes i think there's a team playing uh

2254
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,840

2255
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,199

that you guys want to develop on you

2292
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,600
know

2293
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,239
we already have like the bluetooth ctf

2294
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:53,760
the no quarter

2295
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,320
we don't have a wi-fi for example

2296
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,400
we can always come up with contents and

2297
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,320
then run them from time to time you guys

2298
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,719
can test on

2299
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,159
cool that'd be awesome yeah we're

2300
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,320
definitely planning on continuing to

2301
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,159
build this one out

2302
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,320
great great thank you very much and uh

2303
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,360
i'll see you guys in one hour

2304
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,239
yes

2305
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:17,840
right on one of the fun things was

2306
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,280
like uh

2307
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,040
that i want to mess around with was

2308
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,920
these uh esp32s

2309
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,199
this one has a camera built into it and

2310
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:30,480
could run a web server as well

2311
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,040
so that you could uh look so you load it

2312
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,800
up and then i was thinking of saying oh

2313
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,400
okay connect to this and see what the

2314
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,960
camera's pointing at and try to decode

2315
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,199
that

2316
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:42,960
but you would have to hack into the

2317
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,119
wi-fi for this one

2318
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,400
so

2319
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,960
it's uh they're fun little tool

2320
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,639
uh tools for

2321
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,119
if you're in a certain location if

2322
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:53,840
you're

2323
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,960
doing meetings at an at an event there's

2324
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,280
at a location

2325
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,239
what is that is that it what kind of

2326
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:03,679
i'll look at it

2327
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,520
uh if you have a link maybe i can take

2328
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,480
one to california

2329
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,440

2330
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,040
you can just drive by my house and pick

2331
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,560
it up

2332
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,599
okay

2333
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,360
let's see if i had time

2334
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,639

2335
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:17,960
yeah this is just the

2336
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,719
esp32 cam dash cam

2337
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:21,920
