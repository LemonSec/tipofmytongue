for inviting me over

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
here's a little bit about me i have a

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,879
couple of certs

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
i teach cyber security at cabrillo

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,879
college in santa cruz california

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
i also run a cyber competitions program

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280

as well as a couple of contests in

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
california but if i had to

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
summarize all of that i'm a troublemaker

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,879
since we are on zoom and i will be

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
moving across screens

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,319
throughout the next two hours i suggest

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,239
if you are using the zoom client to

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
change this setting

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
in in zoom under share screen

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
i click on maintain current size that

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
way as i change

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
from wireshark to the ctf and back

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
you don't get the full screen thing that

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
takes over

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
everything it just makes life easier

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
the website is wireshark ctf

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,640

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,839

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,720

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640

112
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680

in the ctf

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,400
we're going to do the beginner category

126
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,440
you can also jump to the wireshark 101

127
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
for those who have some wireshark

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
knowledge

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
jump into network analysis and those who

130
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
are comfortable

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
jump to troubleshooting and wireshark

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
workbook

133
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,840

134
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,119
the ctf as you wish

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
all these questions will be available

136
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
this etf will stay on

137
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,639

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,919
so you are welcome to start with me in

139
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,000

uh you know as much as you want i'll be

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,759
resetting this

142
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
uh when the next event happens but these

143
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
questions will stay up and the contest

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
will stay up itself

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,400
so let's go to the ctf itself

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
once you make an account you will be

147
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,520
presented with the challenges and the

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,080
first

149
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,919
category you see is troubleshooting i

150
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
will be walking you through the beginner

151
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
category which is all the way at the

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
bottom of the page

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,960
so just go ahead and scroll all the way

154
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,198
down

155
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,000
to beginner and i will walk you through

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
as many as we can in the next two hours

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,520
but again

158
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
if you feel that you're comfortable with

159
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
wireshark and you want to try

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
any of the others go ahead

161
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
throughout the the two hours we'll take

162
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
little breaks and we'll see where we

163
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,919
stand in the scoreboard and it looks

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,840
like somebody's already scoring

165
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
uh so let me know that you have

166
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,199
wireshark installed

167
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
you have made an account and you have

168
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,680
scrolled down in the challenges to

169
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
beginner

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,560
and have the first question 1001

171
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
up and ready and to see the question you

172
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:17,280
just click on it

173
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
anybody stuck making an account

174
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
anyone stuck or still downloading

175
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,599
wireshark

176
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,520
i see ready awesome so

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,479
in all the beginner category i have some

178
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,479
text ahead that you can read if you'd

179
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,199
like

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
at the bottom is always the question

181
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,520
for this specific question we need to

182
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,319
open

183
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
this file that you see under follow and

184
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,120
analysis example

185
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
so just click on this link

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,199
and you will download the first

187
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
wireshark file

188
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,560
it should download relatively quickly

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
then go ahead and open it up in

190
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,719
wireshark

191
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
so in this example we have somebody

192
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
who's going to a site

193
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
they make an http get request

194
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,479
in packet 10 and then if everything goes

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
well there's a 200

196
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
okay response the question

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,360
that we're looking to answer here is

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
that what packet

199
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,399
does the user request download.html

200
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
so in wireshark

201
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
here is packet 10 and you can see in the

202
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
info column

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
the get slash and then you see the

204
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
response

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,839
uh the of the ok for that request

206
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
so what we're looking for is for a get

207
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
packet that has slash

208
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,320
download one way that you can do this

209
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
is simply scrolling looking at the info

210
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
column

211
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
as we can see as that client kept asking

212
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
for more things from that site

213
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
eventually we will find

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,920
download when you find it that the

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,839
packet number on this side is the answer

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
another way that you can make things

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
faster

218
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
is go back to packet 10

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,680
and here in the in the packet details

220
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,320
pane

221
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
in this second window we can

222
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
open up the http the hypertext transfer

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
protocol site

224
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,560
we see this get we can expand that

225
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,600
we see the request method

226
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
that is what we're looking for for a

227
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
certain request method you can right

228
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
click it

229
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,839
and say apply as a filter selected

230
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,079
so once again you could go to packet 10.

231
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,200
right click oh sorry i left click on

232
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
hypertext transfer protocol

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
left click on the get and when you see

234
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
get request or get method request method

235
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
get i can read

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,600
right click on it go to apply as

237
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
filter and it's selected

238
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
you will instantly see that wireshark

239
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,959
will put a display filter

240
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,399
up in this bar and now we have filtered

241
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,680
instead of seeing

242
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,200
23 000 packets we're only seeing 74.

243
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
so finding the answer will be that much

244
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,839
faster now

245
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
i can't apply as filter so when you

246
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,920
opened when you clicked on packet 10 you

247
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,240
went

248
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
into the details the packet details pane

249
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,839
you opened up hypertext transfer

250
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,279
protocol

251
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
you also opened up get

252
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
and went down to request method and

253
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
right click on that

254
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,839
and hit apply as a filter selected

255
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,399
so looking at 74 packets you should find

256
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,320
a get download dot html

257
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,839
and that number is the answer

258
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,079
and it looks like we have people already

259
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:11,839
solving stuff awesome

260
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,519
got somebody with 70 points

261
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,839
sirlin

262
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,839
good job good job

263
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
okay ready for the next question

264
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,839
are we still looking for a thousand one

265
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,120
okay in a thousand two

266
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
the second question under the beginner

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
category

268
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,959
we have vlan traffic

269
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,240
so what we want to find is what vlan

270
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
is the communication happening on i took

271
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
a picture

272
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,800
of the packet that we need to look into

273
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,440
which is packet number one

274
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
and i've shown you exactly where the

275
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,880
answer is

276
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,240
so all you have to do is download the

277
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,120
file

278
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
which you have the link for right here

279
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,880
then you'll open it up in wireshark

280
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
and you should be able to see the answer

281
00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:02,320
right in front of you

282
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
look at what look at the

283
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,800
the file when you open it up in

284
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,639
wireshark compare it to

285
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,360
the picture that i have on the ctf

286
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
so you have an idea as to where you're

287
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
looking at

288
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:31,839
that number is the answer

289
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:59,839
good we have people solving away

290
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
if i'm going to pass too fast please say

291
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,120
so

292
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,199
if you need clarification on the

293
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
question please ask away

294
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,279
a thousand three is another simple

295
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,639
question

296
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,279
wireshark tells you all the packets that

297
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,079
are in a trace file

298
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,440
open this pcap

299
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
and answer the simple question how many

300
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
packets are in the trace file

301
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
and i'll give you a clue wireshark tells

302
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,639
you the number of packets that you

303
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
not only see but the total number of

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,639
packets that exist

305
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
in a trace file at the bottom bar

306
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,360
of the application

307
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,759
so go ahead and download app youtube one

308
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
open it up in wireshark and take a quick

309
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,160
look

310
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,399
at the bottom of the application

311
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,160
the total number is the answer

312
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
to this question

313
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
actually i just should just hit don't

314
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
ask again

315
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,440
a thousand four and i think the next

316
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
couple of questions don't have

317
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,959
a uh trace file to open

318
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,800
they all look at this picture here

319
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,560
so again there's some stuff to read if

320
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,959
you'd like

321
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
um

322
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,279
oh i see a question yes this is all

323
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,959
being recorded and will be posted i

324
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
believe in hack miami's

325
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,559
uh youtube yes this will be

326
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
uh this will be posted in the youtube

327
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
channel i was gonna ask you can i tweet

328
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,559
the

329
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,199
the scoreboard i have no problem you

330
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,240
tweeting the scoreboard

331
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
okay because they're probably going to

332
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,359
attack it so

333
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,079
uh i'll tweeted them okay

334
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,919
uh so this question looking at the

335
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
at the diagram what clients can

336
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,080
wireshark number one

337
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,160
listen to wireshark number one is right

338
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
here

339
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,679
what clients can it listen to

340
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
a thousand five looks at the same

341
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,960
question but asks

342
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,799
what end devices can washing number two

343
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:01,840
listen to

344
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
wireshark 1006 or

345
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,640
beginner thousand says asks can wire

346
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,760
shark to

347
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,840
this guy listen to server a

348
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,640
can this computer running wireshark

349
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,000
see what's happening in server a

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,799
a thousand seven asks can wireshark

351
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
number two this computer

352
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,918
see the network 10.1.0.0

353
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
so that set of four questions is related

354
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,559
to the same picture

355
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
again if you get stuck on any one of

356
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:57,840
these 2004 2007 please ask away

357
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,840
a thousand four accepts three different

358
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,120
formats

359
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,640
and it's just the the client

360
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,080
uh alphabetical letter so you don't have

361
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
to put client

362
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,840
in front of every single one

363
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,240
okay then let's

364
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
uh anybody stuck in any of the thousands

365
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:35,840
before i move on to the 2000s

366
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,200
okay let's move on to 2000

367
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
we have another packet to download http

368
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,320
download bad

369
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
so let's download that file and open it

370
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,559
up

371
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,799
the question is what is the round trip

372
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,039
time from the server to the client

373
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,840
packets one and two

374
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,720
so we can focus our attention on the

375
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,760
first two packets

376
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
and see what is the time between packets

377
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
one and two

378
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,520
well by default wireshark tells you the

379
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,559
time

380
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,400
from packets one and on

381
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
so to answer this question we really

382
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,679
just have to look at packet two

383
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,720
and the time that is given to it

384
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,600
which is right here

385
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,840
that would be the answer to that

386
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
question

387
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,880
because we're establishing uh the how

388
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,840
where how does time work with wireshark

389
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,080
in the next question 2002

390
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,919
we're going to open up a different file

391
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
a g

392
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,840
and this asks what is the server delay

393
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,559
between the act and the get request

394
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,158
for packets 9 and 10.

395
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,840
so this one is a little different

396
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,959
because this is not set at zero

397
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
so this number is not necessarily

398
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,400
accurate if we want to calculate

399
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,320
the time between the two

400
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
so what we need to do is to turn packet

401
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,480
nine

402
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,840
into a temporary reference and the

403
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,080
easiest way to do that

404
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,559
is to right click packet number nine

405
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
and set it as the time reference

406
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,120
that means starting from packet nine

407
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
everything else will be calculated based

408
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,000
on this start

409
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,960
time so when you set it

410
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
packet 10 changes because

411
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,840
packet 9 becomes the reference time

412
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,600
so your answer

413
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,159
becomes whatever packet 10 is

414
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,840
because we've shifted the time

415
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
now there is a question in the chat is

416
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,760
there a way to download all captures

417
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
from a single source well all these

418
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,440
trace files come from from laura chapel

419
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,120
i forget the site off the top of my head

420
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,799
but i'm sure it's easy to find here we

421
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,960
go

422
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,320
oops so let me copy this

423
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,320
and paste it in the chat

424
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
if you want to get all of the trace

425
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,840
files

426
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,960
that were that are in the entire ctf

427
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,760
you would need to go into these books

428
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,279
the wireshark workbook

429
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,320
wireshark 101 troubleshooting

430
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
and the big book so i'm going to click

431
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,959
on the big book for example

432
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
and you would download all the trace

433
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,679
files

434
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,679
and that would give you all the trace

435
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,799
files you need

436
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,320
for the network analysis section and

437
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,679
end this at the beginner as well

438
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,360
the troubleshoot relates to the

439
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
troubleshoot category

440
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
wireshark 101 for the washer 101

441
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,600
category and so on and so forth so

442
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,960
you can download all of them at once

443
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,840
it's about two and a half gigabytes

444
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
worth

445
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,640
there is a help on

446
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,840
question 2001

447
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,320
so the initial round trip time between

448
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
packet one and two and that was

449
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:11,840
http download bad

450
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,279
oh i see um

451
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,400
the there's a flag all of them have zero

452
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
point

453
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,120
as shown by wireshark

454
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,600
don't forget the zero at the beginning

455
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
so if you're looking at wireshark for

456
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,158
question 2001

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,039
you you want to copy it

458
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,640
as wireshark shows it to you

459
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
that that just makes it easy for

460
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,799
everyone to

461
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,720
get the feel for how to use wireshark

462
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,159
and what it tells you

463
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,679
so we modeled the the questions after

464
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:07,840
after how wireshark shows them to you

465
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,640
so let's see our scoreboard

466
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,120
sirloin is definitely in the lead with

467
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:35,840
rat not that far behind

468
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,200
cool that's the idea 2002

469
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
so now let's do 2003. hey we need

470
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,840
slowboat which we already have

471
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,480
downloaded

472
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,720
so we can reopen slow boat for this

473
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,559
question

474
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,679
how many bytes are in display using this

475
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,440
filter

476
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,240
luckily enough

477
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,559
we can just copy paste that filter

478
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,360
that's in bold

479
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,320
into this bar where it says apply a

480
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
display filter

481
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,640
then we hit enter and the result

482
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,080
is eight packets that's cool but that

483
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
doesn't give us the answer we're looking

484
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
for

485
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
and this is a math class where we have

486
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,559
to figure out the

487
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,720
the bytes together wireshark does that

488
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,840
for us

489
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,720
in the question it actually told us

490
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,880
where to go

491
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
it told us to go to statistics capture

492
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
file properties so let's do that

493
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,279
click on statistics click on

494
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,640
capture file properties

495
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,480
and we're presented with this window

496
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
this window will tell us

497
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,520
how many bytes are being currently

498
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,720
shown to us versus how many our bytes

499
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,840
exist totally in this trace file

500
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,439
the answer is just the bytes not the

501
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
percentage

502
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
so

503
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,799
again please let me know if i'm going

504
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,279
too fast

505
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,320
if you're stuck on any question please

506
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,678
feel free to ask away

507
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,240
2004

508
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,159
we're going to look at an espn file

509
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,600
so let's click on that

510
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,880
and open it up in wireshark

511
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,919
for our next question

512
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,799
there is a section where we can see the

513
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,720
protocol hierarchy statistics

514
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
the question that we want to answer is

515
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,080
how many packets were fragments

516
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,600
of png well to get to

517
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,960
this that we're looking for

518
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,880
we need to go under statistics

519
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,159
and click on protocol hierarchy

520
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
that should show us

521
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,600
this

522
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,559
but it doesn't really tell us

523
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,360
fragments does it so what we can do

524
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
is we can right click on png which is

525
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,760
portable

526
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,360
network graphic and we can apply as a

527
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
filter

528
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
selected

529
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,360
so once again to get to this you need to

530
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
go under statistics

531
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
protocol hierarchy

532
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,320
then you will see this pop-up

533
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,120
in order to dig down to our answer we're

534
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,760
going to right click this

535
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,200
apply as a filter selected

536
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,840
in wireshark

537
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,720
we see that a filter was applied and now

538
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,760
we have a couple

539
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,519
of of uh packets

540
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,440
but this also doesn't give us the answer

541
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,200
we're looking for

542
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,279
what we need to do to this is make one

543
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,760
change

544
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,679
and if you follow the the rabbit hole

545
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,799
we're going to right click on

546
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,159
transmission control protocol

547
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,519
we're going to go under protocol

548
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,600
preferences

549
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,559
and disable the third option allow sub

550
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,120
dissectors to reassemble tcp streams

551
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,000
so once again after applying the png

552
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,279
filter

553
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,039
and only seeing 10 packets

554
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,240
we're going to click on the first packet

555
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,440
right click tcp

556
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,240
go on the protocol preferences and

557
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
uncheck

558
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,320
the third option allow subdissectors to

559
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
reassemble tcp streams

560
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,399
when you do that you will see how many

561
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,840
packets are fragments

562
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,519
i see a question in the chat having

563
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,760
issues downloading pcap

564
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,000
file in chrome have you tried

565
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:39,840
downloading them in firefox

566
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
i think when you click the link in

567
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
firefox it tells

568
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,839
it asks you if you want to just open it

569
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
directly which could be

570
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
better since we're moving from file to

571
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
file throughout this

572
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,839
the ctf

573
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,280
okay people are making progress this is

574
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,679
awesome

575
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,359
um before i continue to showing more

576
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,399
questions

577
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,679
i'll wait uh 10 minutes if anybody has

578
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,159
been trying the harder questions

579
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,839
and it's stuck feel free to ask

580
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,040
for my beginners feel free to continue

581
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,119
into 2004 and beyond or

582
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,760
try out any of the wireshark 101s

583
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,440
but in about nine minutes i'll continue

584
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:30,960
with the next questions in beginner

585
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,680
hey yeah urban just got a good question

586
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,240
um

587
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,640
doing the wireshark 101 and um on 102

588
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,400
it's gonna that question should be

589
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,520
pretty straightforward but i've seen no

590
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,839
one has solved

591
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,280
any hints on this one is it just the

592
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,839
formatting

593
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,030
let me see uh name model

594
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,119
[Music]

595
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,320
two

596
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,760
so i'll add a example

597
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,320
oops

598
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,839
so now if you look at 102 you have an

599
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,320
example

600
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,720
of how it's asking for the answer

601
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,839
all right cool let me try that again

602
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
thanks

603
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,119

uh 2006 in which category glenn

605
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,480
uh well i'll get to 2006 in a bit

606
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,839
in beginner because we just stopped at

607
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,040
2003

608
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280

anyone else stuck in any of the

617
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,960
wireshark 101s network analysis

618
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,960
the workbook or troubleshooting

619
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,839
that needs a hint

620
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
so

621
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,839
oh

622
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
so

623
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,760
um

that need to cl need a hint a clue

626
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,839
before i continue with beginner

627
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,359
uh 2006 in net analysis

628
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,200
yeah i'll do beginner as soon as i i

629
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,480
just want to make sure that anybody

630
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,640
who's working on the harder levels

631
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,320
and needs a hint this is their chance to

632
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,640
ask

633
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,920
for now since we are doing this live you

634
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,320
can ask for hints here

635
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
after we're done with this event you can

636
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:11,839
ask in discord

637
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,440
when there are two items to answer

638
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,000
normally it will be

639
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,520
it the answer one comma space answer two

640
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,280
if there's a specific question you're

641
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,119
asking about samuel let me know and

642
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,160
um i can make a change to

643
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,920
have it clear yes at the end i'll give

644
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,359
you a brief overview of discord

645
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,720
tr06

646
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,880
scroll to that

647
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,040
after removing all the noise the common

648
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,839
protocols how many packets remain

649
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,839
uh am i looking for only tcp packets

650
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,200
well you want to remove

651
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,240
the noise so anything that is common and

652
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,280
there are a couple

653
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,319
of common protocols

654
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,560
looks like there are at least two

655
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,400
layer seven protocols and uh one layer

656
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,359
four one layer

657
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,359
what is that two that you can remove out

658
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,400
of the way

659
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,760
and then you'll be able to uh see what's

660
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
left

661
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,720
so that that question is all about

662
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,680
reducing the protocols that are common

663
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,839
that you that you would see in any any

664
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,839
network

665
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,240
so that's kind of the clue remove the

666
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
things you would see on

667
00:41:50,160 --> 00:42:03,839
any network

668
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,839
okay

669
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,479
there

670
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,960
yeah i'm not sure why that person

671
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:45,520
thought they could do that but

672
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,359
so for now i have everybody muted

673
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,400
so we'll just we'll just stick to the

674
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,520
chat

675
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,680
yep that's exactly what i did i muted

676
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,520
everyone without the

677
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,880
availability to unmute

678
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,960
oh well all right

679
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,599
let's see we stopped on 2004

680
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,480
2005.

681
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,520
identify the most active conversations

682
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,520
have another file to download and open

683
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,160
we're looking at the statistics

684
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,480
conversations so we can open that file

685
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,720
up

686
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,160
switch over to wireshark

687
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,000
under statistics conversations

688
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,440
from the menu and we are presented with

689
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,760
this

690
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,880
and what we want to find out is what is

691
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,680
the the time for the longest specific

692
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,560
conversation

693
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,720
so you can look around

694
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,200
that could be specific but that's not

695
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,520
exactly what we're looking for it

696
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,280
probably will not be here because we

697
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
want specific so it's probably going to

698
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,599
land

699
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,720
between tcp and udp and there's a

700
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,160
duration column

701
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,319
that you can sort by to find what the

702
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,839
answer is

703
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,560
now while you do that i see a question

704
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,440
about

705
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,240
beginner 2003 that i can

706
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,040
quickly answer

707
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,960
how do i apply the filter so what you

708
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,640
need to do

709
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,079
is copy the entire section that's in

710
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,520
bold

711
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,720
from tcp analysis to window update hit

712
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,118
copy

713
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,839
and in that file

714
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,079
you will paste it right up here where it

715
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,760
says apply a display filter

716
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,200
that bar will go green indicating that

717
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,119
the display filter you entered is

718
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,800
correct

719
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,839
and then you hit enter

720
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,200
and it will change the number

721
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:47,839
of packets that you see on screen

722
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,440
2006 a question we had

723
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,480
some folks asking about this is sec

724
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,839
client.pcappng so i'll have that open

725
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,119
using the same file we're going to open

726
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,400
statistics

727
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,280
packet lengths so let's do that let's go

728
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
to statistics

729
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,160
let's go to packet lengths

730
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,839
and what are we presented with

731
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,200
this little thing we can apply

732
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,400
filters directly to view data

733
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,920
as we want if we want to focus and

734
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,560
here's the question down at the bottom

735
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,119
if we want to focus on two packets with

736
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,800
similar size

737
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,839
what is the full display filter

738
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,440
two packets of similar size we're

739
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,800
looking at this list at the count

740
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,760
column here are two packets

741
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,200
that have similar size

742
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,119
so what we can do is uh

743
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,640
we know the the length

744
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,520
so 640 to 12.79 uh-oh

745
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,839
open the wireshark there we go

746
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,400
is we need to make a

747
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,000
display filter for packet lengths of 6

748
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,160
what i say 649 of the picture

749
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,680
640 to 1279.

750
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,599
anything that you want to make a filter

751
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,680
for you can find

752
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,640
in the packets in uh in here in the

753
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,119
packet details pane

754
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,520
so what we need to do is find we can

755
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,640
either find

756
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,760
or uh test

757
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,040
uh you know in here for the

758
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,000
proper thing that we're looking for

759
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,720
pull this up

760
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,480
so there is a length

761
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,400
that we can use as a filter

762
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,119
it is in should be right within here

763
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,400
actually

764
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,359
frame cap length frame len

765
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,599
so if you're looking at my screen down

766
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,000
at the bottom

767
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,599
anytime that you click on something

768
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,359
within details pane

769
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,079
you'll see an explanation and in

770
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,839
parentheses what you would use

771
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,319
as a as a filter

772
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,680
so frame.len is really what we're

773
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,240
looking for

774
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,800
so frame.len would be the start

775
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,520
now we can use some things like

776
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,880
greater than equal to and the number we

777
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,000
said was

778
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,960
640.

779
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,040
we can also add on to

780
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,319
our display filter to

781
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,640
make like a minimum and maximum and you

782
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,160
notice as i'm typing

783
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,720
the that bar is going red and green so

784
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,119
right now if if it was just this

785
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,319
we could hit enter and we would see all

786
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,319
packets that have a frame length

787
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,359
of greater than or equal to 640 but we

788
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,960
don't just want all of those we want to

789
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,960
focus on two packets

790
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,240
so we should be able to do

791
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,720
and and because we want to join two

792
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,640
together

793
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,000
and do frame.len

794
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,160
with less than equal to

795
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,319
uh 1279 i'm looking at the picture that

796
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:02,720
i have

797
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,480
on the on the ctf and you see the bar

798
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,410
turned green

799
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,599
[Music]

800
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,440
so this puts our display filter

801
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,559
in saying uh wireshark show me all

802
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,520
packets

803
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,520
that have the frame length of greater

804
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,680
than or equal to 640

805
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,400
and have a frame length that goes no

806
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,040
more

807
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,319
than 1279 that should narrow

808
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,000
down what you're looking for to that

809
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:41,839
minimum maximum

810
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,919
yeah 640 1279

811
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,240
that's the that's the one we're looking

812
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
for

813
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,720
so as you can see you can join multiple

814
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,680
display filters together with operands

815
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,078
like an

816
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,839
end

817
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,119
let's see the scoreboard before we move

818
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,319
on to three thousands

819
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,240
sirland is still in the lead

820
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,839
22 players cool cool

821
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,359
um anyone still stuck on any questions

822
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,839
in the thousands or two thousands

823
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
do

824
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,000
oh i see a question for something that

825
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,040
is

826
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,839
in wireshark 101 looking at question

827
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
301

828
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,599
how many tr frames travel to or from

829
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,960
that specific

830
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:05,359
um looking at 301 but if i do

831
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,400
ip source or destination i get 519. if i

832
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,440
do ipadder

833
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,119
519 but the answer is not accepted

834
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,880
so uh phil

835
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,720
there is a simpler way to do iep source

836
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,880
or destination

837
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,800
and that's actually by using ip

838
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,240
adder so like this ip dot

839
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,599
addr equals equals and then the ip

840
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,319
address you want

841
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,040
that way it it takes the ip address

842
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,079
either way for a specific address

843
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,839
so you don't have to do ipsource or ip

844
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,839
destination

845
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,599
um it you shouldn't be missing anything

846
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,640
after doing that you the answer should

847
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,160
appear

848
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,800
at the bottom where it shows you the

849
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:38,559
total display packets

850
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,319
yeah yeah that it works

851
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,920
so i would try just doing the ip adder

852
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,319
uh remove any uh wait are you on the

853
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:54,720
right

854
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,040
file

855
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,400
because i just did that on my computer

856
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,240
and i got the right answer

857
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,359
oh wait a minute oh oh yeah you're

858
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,280
looking at the wrong place

859
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,559
that's what's happening is you're

860
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,599
looking at the wrong place

861
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:22,000
so uh you are correct in

862
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,160
519 but you're looking at the wrong

863
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,040
location

864
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,960
right place wrong location

865
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,400
let's see i thought that's another

866
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,880
question

867
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
finally got going a thousand one

868
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,480
beginners what command syntax do i use

869
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,760
to look up

870
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,119
for wireshark.org

871
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:03,839
i don't know what you're looking for

872
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,839
right

873
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,880
okay

874
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,760
3001.

875
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,720
we're going to look at the colors that

876
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,040
wireshark has been showing us

877
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,760
in the trace files that we've opened and

878
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,520
we're going to open another one

879
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,960
yahoo via firefox

880
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,010
[Music]

881
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,400
and we want to put our focus

882
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,440
on packet 804

883
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,960
so rather than scrolling through 803

884
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,960
packets we should be able to just type

885
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,599
packet

886
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,839
number i'm not mistaken

887
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,799
i think it's packet.num

888
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,520
nope or is it packing number

889
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,599
you know what's the easy way is to just

890
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,720
go oh

891
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,839
frame number

892
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,040
frame that number

893
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,240
so as you saw when i typed packet

894
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,680
that was incorrect the bar was red

895
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,640
i looked in the packet details pane i

896
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,839
see frame number one

897
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,079
there's frame number one down here it

898
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,520
says frame.number

899
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,880
that's the correct syntax frame.number

900
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,720
equals 804.

901
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,839
so we just zoomed and focused on that

902
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,680
one packet because that's the

903
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,200
as for the question 3001 what color or

904
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,240
what rule

905
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,520
color packet 804 so just like i was able

906
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,839
to quickly sort through to get to that

907
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:26,880
packet

908
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,920
this packet was given a specific color

909
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,119
in here actually right in

910
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,240
in the frame section

911
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,920
you will find the answer to see what

912
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,960
rule

913
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,160
colored that packet

914
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,599
and if you want a reference of the

915
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,839
colors i kind of showed you them

916
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,839
here

917
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,920
you

918
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,799
okay

919
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,079
any questions on 301 before i move on to

920
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,720
302

921
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,160
whoa sterling took a boost

922
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,000
okay 3002

923
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,200
we're using the same file awesome what

924
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,079
rule

925
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,559
was used to color dns packets

926
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,440
going back to wireshark let's remove

927
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,119
this display filter

928
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,200
lucky for us dns packets are right up at

929
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,640
the beginning

930
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,000
so you can just scroll inside of the

931
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,400
packet details frame

932
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,520
for frame one and in the same place

933
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,559
where you saw

934
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,880
the answer to 3001 you'll see the answer

935
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,839
for 3002.

936
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,440
sirloin is just on a roll

937
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,160
yeah be careful with that sterling guy

938
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,250
he's dangerous

939
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,430
[Laughter]

940
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,640
can't get wireshark 101 or

941
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,920
301 oh

942
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,599
oh watch your 101 question 301 um

943
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,960
so similar to phil

944
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,839
oh wait

945
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,839
uh question 301

946
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:35,839
doesn't need a a i o graph

947
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,119
this one this one doesn't need a graph

948
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,160
this one uh you just need

949
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,599
to filter for any packets that come in

950
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:48,319
and out

951
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,960
in or out of this ip address and the

952
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,119
easiest way is to just make the one

953
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,920
filter that does both at once

954
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:03,839
which is ip.adr oh i mean question 501

955
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,839
the io graph with the bits per second

956
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:17,839
501

957
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:39,520
um so it accepts the answer

958
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,440
it's a six digit number so it actually

959
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,920
accepts a six digit number a six digit

960
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,720
whole number

961
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,960
it also accepts it if you did it

962
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,799
as something like or you know like 10

963
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,599
with the letter k

964
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,680
it also accepts it that way as well

965
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:13,839
but it is looking for a whole number

966
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,319
and all that you should really do is

967
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,319
make the graph statistics

968
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:40,720
io graph

969
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,440
and set the y-axis that's incorrect so

970
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:43,760
let's

971
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,880
remove these guys

972
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:54,160
from packets

973
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,839
two bits per second which is the third

974
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,400
option here

975
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,119
so that peak that highest peak

976
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,839
you would zoom in

977
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,440
oh i see

978
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,839
so

979
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,440
it should

980
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:51,839
try to try again

981
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,839
so

982
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,599
okay that was my mistake

983
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,839
but good thing is we can easily fix

984
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,078
these

985
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,319
let's see uh did i do 3004 i have not

986
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,359
done 3004

987
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,640
or three actually i haven't started the

988
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,440
three thousands

989
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,160
that's right oh yeah we did this one to

990
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,319
colorize that traffic

991
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:49,038
and we did this one so we are on 3003.

992
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,359
good thing is i'm not playing so you can

993
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,839
minus all the points you want from me

994
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,240
um question 3003 i know i'm cheating i

995
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,359
can see all the answers

996
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,559
here are a list of comparison operators

997
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,760
we used

998
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,640
and recently you could also use the

999
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,599
actual word and

1000
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,400
uh or things like not equal the not

1001
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,119
equal or

1002
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,839
any various ways to get what you want

1003
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,640
but what we're looking for in http

1004
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,520
download bed

1005
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,839
is what is the name of the file being

1006
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,000
downloaded

1007
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,799
so we can open up http download bed

1008
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,599
and we should be able to just copy

1009
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,119
that filter that's provided for us here

1010
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,559
and see what we can find

1011
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,680
so take the filter that is right above

1012
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,319
the question

1013
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,479
in 3003 apply it

1014
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,479
to http download bad and you should

1015
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,839
see the answer

1016
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,880
3004

1017
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,399
is similar but uses a different file

1018
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:53,839
http download good

1019
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:07,839
same with three thousand five

1020
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,479
a roman please try again and

1021
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:24,799
assignment as well tell me if it works

1022
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,799
it should just be the file name

1023
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:35,839
not the whole not the whole string

1024
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:42,158
so for example

1025
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,399
looking at question 3003

1026
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,839
it is not everything starting from this

1027
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:52,560
slash

1028
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,920
it's just the name of the file itself

1029
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,560
uh yes you should be adding the

1030
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,120
extension

1031
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,719
so for 3003 it would be from this

1032
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:17,840
capital o all the way out to dot exe

1033
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,840
so

1034
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,800
sterling at 400.

1035
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:59,840
with almost a tie for second place

1036
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,840
all right three thousand six because

1037
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,560
five was the last one of that

1038
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,199
three thousand six i'm going to use

1039
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,840
graphs

1040
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,840
now

1041
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,480
we want to open up this file

1042
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,280
and to get to a graph like this

1043
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,440
we need to go to statistics i o graphs

1044
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,880
so once that file is opened go under

1045
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,800
statistics

1046
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:09,360
i iographs

1047
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,760
now i need to change this back to make

1048
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,120
it look just like the picture

1049
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,719
and looks like we need to add another

1050
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,719
in display filter it's a tcp dot

1051
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:32,400
analysis dot flags

1052
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,360
and we want it to be a bar

1053
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
and looks like we can change the color

1054
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,360
to red

1055
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,199
that just made an exact replica

1056
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,640
of the graph you see in the question in

1057
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,239
question 3006.

1058
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,840
so the question is asking what packet

1059
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,320
was used to calculate the highest point

1060
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,040
in the graph

1061
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,400
well that's not the highest point

1062
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,880
that's the highest point now

1063
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,719
interestingly enough

1064
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,840
if i click on that high point you see

1065
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,520
over here

1066
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,840
in italicize it says no packets in

1067
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,320
interval

1068
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,600
well that's because we've highlighted

1069
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,360
over this rule

1070
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,480
if you highlight over the correct rule

1071
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,600
that made the line suddenly you see

1072
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,679
packets for example in the second

1073
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,719
highest point

1074
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,800
you see that that made that was created

1075
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,199
by packet

1076
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:43,120
5756 so now

1077
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,920
just by moving your mouse around the

1078
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,520
other points you'll be able to see the

1079
01:13:47,520 --> 01:14:01,840
answer to this question

1080
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,719
uh wireshark 101 question 602 it is

1081
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,400
asking for the entire

1082
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,320
location the entire uri

1083
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:29,840
or url

1084
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,920
and that is case insensitive yeah it's

1085
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,520
looking for the entire length

1086
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:57,840
of the address

1087
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:05,199
anyone uh stuck on any questions so far

1088
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,120
now we're about halfway through the

1089
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,840
three thousands

1090
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,600
and we also have 30 minutes left

1091
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:25,840
on this event

1092
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:39,840
yeah once the whole thing

1093
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,239
i have added an example to that question

1094
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,760
where do i get the pdf of the questions

1095
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,760
um there's no pdf

1096
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,840
of these questions they are all in this

1097
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,840
etf

1098
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,080
any hints for 601

1099
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,320
i'm trying to find the jps that don't

1100
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,040
respond with

1101
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,760
304

1102
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:49,839
and has raw data

1103
01:16:50,080 --> 01:17:03,040
philip found the file names

1104
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,800
don't know the format expected by the

1105
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,080
flag

1106
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,640
it is just the file name so i'll put an

1107
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,600
example

1108
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,440
example file1.jpg

1109
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,839
comma file2.jpg

1110
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,640
and update so now if you reopen that

1111
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,360
question

1112
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:30,000
601 i'll go to it here

1113
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:45,840
have an example

1114
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,840
so

1115
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,199
so

1116
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,920
sterling is definitely gonna win if this

1117
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:27,840
was a real contest

1118
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,800
um so with less than 30 minutes left

1119
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,040
i can i can show whichever questions

1120
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:41,840
you'd like

1121
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,400
or i can also let you guys keep going

1122
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,000
and whenever you get stuck on a question

1123
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,840
you can ask away

1124
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:08,590
[Music]

1125
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:29,609
[Music]

1126
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,159
again this site will stay on so you can

1127
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,080
continue

1128
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,679
well beyond this event

1129
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,320
eventually when another event rolls

1130
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,239
around i'll reset this but

1131
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,800
the the link will stay up and the game

1132
01:19:52,800 --> 01:20:05,840
will stay available to anyone

1133
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,840
so

1134
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,360
let me know if there's a question you

1135
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,839
want me to demo

1136
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:01,840
or one that you're stuck on

1137
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:14,000
beginner 3007.

1138
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,760
the x and y axis

1139
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,600
recreate the graph above

1140
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,080
what is the new peak

1141
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,560
so i open the file up i go into

1142
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:43,280
io graphs

1143
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:47,840
i have this from what we did earlier

1144
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,120
we want to change to time of day and we

1145
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,840
want to click on log

1146
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,760
scale

1147
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,840
so that has now altered our graph

1148
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,520
to match the

1149
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,880
the one in the picture so now

1150
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,000
highlighting on the all packets you can

1151
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,120
move around again to find the the new

1152
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,560
peak

1153
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,280
and that packet that constitutes that

1154
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:19,760
that

1155
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:25,520
new highest peak is uh the answer

1156
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:39,840
should be a rounded number

1157
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,239
yes so that question should really say

1158
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,920
what is the new peak

1159
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,320
packet

1160
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,840
number

1161
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,480
uh in 1.07 oh someone's trying to let

1162
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,000
the workbook awesome

1163
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:07,679
it's asking about the uri

1164
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,639
in a frame nine

1165
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,840
but it is marked as wrong well i see

1166
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,440
what you submitted

1167
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,040
and that is incorrect because that is

1168
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,639
not what it's asking

1169
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,880
for

1170
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:32,000
in wireshark 101 challenge 701

1171
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,880
it asks for a message but there are

1172
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,000
three messages

1173
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,800
in the pcap um

1174
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,159
there should be one that it's really

1175
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,879
looking for

1176
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,920
the message in the annotation let's go

1177
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,400
back to

1178
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,040
oh not that one this one

1179
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,880
yeah it should be it should be one

1180
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,679
message

1181
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:24,239
not the not the individual ones for the

1182
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,840
packets

1183
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,159
so i added the word overall to that

1184
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,559
question

1185
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:59,840
phil were you able to solve a 1.07

1186
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:27,839
you were really close to the answer

1187
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,840
so

1188
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,600
geminis and aleph nov pretty much

1189
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,840
neck and neck

1190
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,040
about 18 minutes let's see who actually

1191
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:37,840
ends up taking second place

1192
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,840
so

1193
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:43,600
15 minutes left

1194
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,280
like i said feel free to try other

1195
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,120
questions

1196
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,800
for example for all our beginner folks

1197
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,080
feel free to try out any of the

1198
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,280
wireshark 101s

1199
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,040
or continue in the beginner category

1200
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:11,840
if you're stuck on any please ask away

1201
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,400
for 3007

1202
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:35,840
isn't it the number from the left scale

1203
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,840
so

1204
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,199
um yes it should be the number from the

1205
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,480
left rounded of course

1206
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,440
for 3007 the number is rounded

1207
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,920
for 2.07

1208
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,920
2.07

1209
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,840
let's open up it up and up it up up up

1210
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,239
up

1211
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:20,239
2.07

1212
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,480
what version of web software is running

1213
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,280
on the server

1214
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,920
answer the form of the program the

1215
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,840
version number

1216
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,600
and the operating system

1217
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,560
so phil you have given two of the three

1218
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:45,840
things you need to answer that question

1219
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,400
okay so the program you have that

1220
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,560
version number you have that but you're

1221
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,440
missing the os

1222
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,280
ah then let me fix that answer in the

1223
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,320
form

1224
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,040
colon program version os

1225
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,840
that's okay

1226
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,440
so now if you refresh that question it

1227
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,320
should

1228
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,560
look uh it should look a little better

1229
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,560
answer in the form program version of us

1230
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:55,520
uh p you asking about question

1231
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,100
3007

1232
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:03,619
[Music]

1233
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,120
so here is the graph

1234
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:17,839
and that looks like it's the new peak

1235
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,880
so what i'll do is i will zoom in to

1236
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,840
that peak

1237
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,760
as far down as i can with keeping whole

1238
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,239
numbers

1239
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,840
there you go

1240
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:05,840
i'm glad you got a phil

1241
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:19,199
let me make a flag that will do it in

1242
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:22,239
commas as well

1243
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:33,840
just in case there we go

1244
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:47,840
we have 10 minutes left

1245
01:34:53,679 --> 01:35:01,840
so uh let me go to

1246
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,840
okay

1247
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,000
i'll wait four more minutes

1248
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,960
for any uh any other questions

1249
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,760
and then i'll take the last the last

1250
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,480
five minutes

1251
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,199
i know somebody asked me to explain

1252
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:34,799
discord so i'll do that briefly

1253
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:43,839
and then i'll hand it back to rod

1254
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,840
so

1255
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,239
2.12

1256
01:36:53,239 --> 01:36:56,239
2.12

1257
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:59,520
is not that what you gave

1258
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,960
phil that is not the browser that is

1259
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:07,280
being used

1260
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,080
by the client

1261
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:23,679
but you are right in what frame to look

1262
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,840
at

1263
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,840
so

1264
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:30,000
it's just looking for the one the one um

1265
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,440
browser so it's not it's not

1266
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:45,839
a browser in another mode

1267
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,840
gotcha

1268
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:55,840
yeah that should work

1269
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:09,679
i'm so briefly showing discord

1270
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,000
discord is a free either application or

1271
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,760
you can use it totally in the browser

1272
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,520
in the wireshark ctf on the home page

1273
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,960
i have a link to join this specific

1274
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,320
discord server

1275
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,679
where i have all of my classes you are

1276
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,440
welcome to join

1277
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,639
when you do get there there are there

1278
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,199
are rules like there are in most

1279
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:38,639
discord servers to read through

1280
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,040
then you can go to assign course and you

1281
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:41,679
just click

1282
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,080
on the one you want so for example if

1283
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,000
you wanted to continue this ctf and if

1284
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,360
you get stuck on something you want to

1285
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,280
ask a question well it's all

1286
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,320
uh cis140na

1287
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,800
that's the shark so you would just click

1288
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,679
on

1289
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,320
the little shark and you will be given

1290
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,440
the role like these folks

1291
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,040
and then you'll be able to see the

1292
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,520
conversations for that specific class

1293
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,360
and and chat with others who are also

1294
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,239
working

1295
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:11,440
on this ctf as well

1296
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,119
it's just like slack it's

1297
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:17,040
you know they have the various rooms to

1298
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,400
chat with others and whatnot

1299
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,719
pretty easy to use if you get stuck on

1300
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,199
anything please feel free to ask away

1301
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:26,880
but this is what you should see when you

1302
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,960
immediately log in

1303
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,560
when you click on that link create an

1304
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,000
account and join it

1305
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,280
you'll the general will look like that

1306
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,880
but what you really want to do is go to

1307
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,400
a signed course

1308
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:42,638
and pick the shark so that you join

1309
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,840
cs140na

1310
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,080
all right we're getting ready to close

1311
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,840
and call it or no we're not calling it

1312
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,520

1313
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,719
um i will leave that to you what's up

1314
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:01,920
well you're the

1315
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,119
the ctf master you had to

1316
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,719
you had to decide when you want to cut

1317
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,000
it off i mean we can call it off at

1318
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,119

um well it definitely looks like sirloin

1322
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,560
one

1323
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,119
this it happens they happen to be

1324
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:25,760
usually

1325
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,400
buffalo then the like the the teams are

1326
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,880
always competing each other at miami

1327
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,080
that's actually kind of cool um

1328
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:37,760

1333
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,040

and just just running that way anybody

1339
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,639
can jump in later to do more questions

1340
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:02,880
and

1341
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:08,159

1342
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,800
but we'll say for for the sake of today

1343
