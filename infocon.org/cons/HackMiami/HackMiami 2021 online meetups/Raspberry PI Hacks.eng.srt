1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,320
okay so this video is for vince up in

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,360
toronto for

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,240
imi mobile hey vince i just thought i'd

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,440
kind of share a little something with

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,720
you here a little project i've been

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,320
working on over the last uh two days or

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,960
so

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,719
and real quickly let's go over this

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
so this is a raspberry pi zero w

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,720
um slightly modified i did actually have

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
to solder the header

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,160
onto the raspberry pi zero but once i

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
got that done all you really have to do

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,000
is attach a wire to one of these

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
gpio pins and with that it makes it an

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,079
antenna and with the antenna you can

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,559
actually

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,160
broadcast through a fairly high spectrum

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,600
um covering most of fm bands as well as

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,480
aviation bands and so this project came

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
up because there was talk about how

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,640
hackers were actually broadcasting over

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
the emergency frequency for the federal

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
aviation administration on 121.5

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,000
megahertz

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
about a stupid attack or some stupid

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,600
 like that anyways

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
we've decided we were trying to

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,199
reduplicate that and although we didn't

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,600
reduplicate it perfectly and that was

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,760
because of regulatory reasons uh i don't

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
want to go to jail

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
but the fact we can actually uh

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
reproduce this and to some extent

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
we're going to go ahead and do that so

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,200
over here i have

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
a ham radio tuned into an fm frequency

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,439
which is previously specified right next

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,880
to my crow pi

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
and i've got another ham radio up here

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
which is actually also tuned to the same

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,799
frequency

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
let's go ahead and turn it on

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,479
frequency mode cheap bowfang radio

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
and you can barely hear the hiss and so

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
the raspberry pi itself

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,159
is connected to this screen

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:55,840
and let's go ahead and up arrow

49
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,889
[Music]

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:09,840
this one's dedicated

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
so this raspberry pi can actually

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
broadcast

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
over a very large spectrum through a

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,440
wide range of frequencies up to about a

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,640
football field away

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
or uh i guess you guys would call it a

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
soccer field away

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
anyways i thought this is something you

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,959
might

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,360
me after i'm at like dog plus

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
velociraptor

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
don't prove we're human unless we really

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,879
have to a team build schemes and destroy

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,920
recapture

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
take what they see finish this chapter

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,560
by the
