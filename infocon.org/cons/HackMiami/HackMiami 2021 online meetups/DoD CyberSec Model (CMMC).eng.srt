of this recording my name is rod soto

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,200
and

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,519
i am one of the co-founders

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,440
and um organizers of hack miami

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,640
pacific hackers today we have michael

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,600
brown

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
who is our absolute policy expert

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,000
this gentleman has a

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,240
incredible amount of experience

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
uh this is our go-to guy

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,440
for policy he's always on top of it

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
anything that is

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
um up and coming um

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,719
uh and i would say to a certain degree

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,480
difficult to understand at times he

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
makes it easy for us to understand that

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,399
he makes it easy

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
for us

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
to approach it and i think there's a lot

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
of value in what he says because most of

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,800
us

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
in our job at least

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
we had to deal with some of this

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
policies at times where we're talking

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,039
about other departments or we have a

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
specific incident

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,600
and

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
it's hard to just start from the

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,640
beginning

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
without having any directions and that's

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
the value

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
of the talks that michael puts together

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
comes he he does an incredible job

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
uh making it straightforward and telling

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
you this is why you need to pay

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,280
attention this is what you need to look

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,080
for and for that i'm very grateful uh

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,799
michael so um

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,280
i'm gonna let you take the floor and uh

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,759
thanks again and we'll leave the

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
the questions for

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
uh the end

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
and um

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,960
take it away

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,640

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,639

okay

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,119
so let me move some of these things

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,119
because i can't drive okay that's better

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
so today i'm talking about what's called

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,239
the

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,440
dod department defense uh cmmc

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
capability maturity model certification

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
which has been worked on

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
at this point we're almost you know

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
probably about two years and this was

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
something that i was actually fairly

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,640
heavily involved in last year

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
um since a

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,239
change in my job

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
it's a bit less so

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
so

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
come on say a little background on

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,519
myself i've been involved in the field

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,120
for quite a while i was actually kind of

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
surprised when i was like

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,599
that's

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,920
how long i've been involved in i.t and

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
so forth

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,599
uh so actually sort of a system

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,920
administrator um i actually was

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
involved with it organization of

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
motorola that was dealt with the

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
capability maturity model um and we were

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
actually i assessed an id organization

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
that was one of my first in

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
introduction to these sort of

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
systems and so forth i worked my way up

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
the ladder to being a global

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
security architect

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,599
um left i spent about seven years as a

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
security consultant

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
in the area of governance risks and

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,159
compliance basically going and working

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,480
with various companies you know i'm

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,599
always kind of almost kind of shocked

91
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
that the variety of companies and what i

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,959
was doing with them in terms of looking

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,000
at their

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,519
their security programs and how to

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
improve them and so forth

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
i left that last december um i'm not a

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,480
new job

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,200
or i'm a security compliance director uh

99
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
for a company in the health care space

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
but for us we have to be

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
i trust certified

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
stock one and two and that's my

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,959
responsibility to make sure that we

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,040
maintain that

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
when it comes to cmc i was i'm actually

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
what's called a certified professional

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
of course that's going to expire soon i

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
never got to use it

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
and if you don't know what that is don't

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
worry i will explain it i'm involved

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,760
with various groups here uh isis a i've

112
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,879
been one of the chapter officers i've

113
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,599
been involved with infragard isaka

114
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
isc squared

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
iapp which is privacy i got into last

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,720
year

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,159
i helped out with hack miami's a little

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
bit back about myself those who are not

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
aware of me

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,399
so

121
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,839
come on

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
okay so outline you know give you kind

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,479
of a background of what this all is

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
i'm getting i'm going to cover into the

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,720
third party or vendor management because

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
that's kind of the driver

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,759
for this

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
and then going into some of these you

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
know i would have called certifications

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
for companies which again is a big part

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
of it um

132
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,919
how they kind of came up with the cmmc

133
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,160
and then of course what's referred to as

134
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
the ecology for the cmc that's the term

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,479
they use

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,759
and then we'll get into the details of

137
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
the cmsc actually i've actually had the

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
pdfs of it

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
i actually brought with me some of my

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
dad's apartment

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
this is my hard copy of the cmc that i

142
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,840
printed out for myself you know it is

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
uh over an inch thick

144
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
of it that i got i put together myself

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
to figure okay i'm going to be doing

146
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,000
this um so and of course this is you can

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
get this as a pdf online

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
um it's a bit it's a bit dry but that's

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
true a lot of these sort of sort of

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
programs so let me go over the basics

151
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
again i said the cmc is the cyber

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,639
security maturity model certification it

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
is

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,479
basically a third-party assessment

155
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,600
program

156
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,039
but it also includes training and

157
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
certification which makes it much more

158
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,560
complex

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
within what's referred to as the us

160
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,639
defense industrial base the d.i.b

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
so fair warning

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
there are a lot of

163
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
acronyms because we're not we're dealing

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
with the dod

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,199
so that's one thing you need to do you

166
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,639
need to realize

167
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
it aims to protect what's called um

168
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,919
federal contract information fci

169
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,720
and

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
controlled unclassified information

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,319
cui which is pronounced

172
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,759
kui

173
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
and i learned that you know when we got

174
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,319
into this is that

175
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,880
they will call they will say cui lot so

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
you hear that no what the heck is that

177
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
that's what that is

178
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
um it replaces a self-assessment that

179
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,080
was brought up oh

180
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,800
sorry about this i'm not sure why

181
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,919
um

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
they would replace a self-assessment

183
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
that defense contoured had to go through

184
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,880
using

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
uh this uh sp 800 171 you know because

186
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,919
of course we know

187
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,479
that asking people to do a

188
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,000
self-assessment

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
um

190
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,680
rarely works

191
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
what they're doing is that it will be a

192
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
requirement

193
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
for contractors

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,560
to meet certain cmfc levels

195
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
you know before the contracts are going

196
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,280
out after there's five levels i'll go

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
into this and it's being rolled out over

198
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
the next few years

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
now what's kind of interesting

200
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
is that the general services

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
administration that's gs gsa

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,319
has stated that at this point

203
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
is only needed for dod contracts

204
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
but it will be required for all

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,639
federal government contractors at some

206
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,680
point

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
so while the focus now is you know dod

208
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,880
and

209
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
dvd contractors

210
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,919
is probably gonna be all federal

211
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,360
contractors

212
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
down the road

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,479
and please understand when i say to win

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
so when i say contractors these are

215
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,240
these are companies doing contracts for

216
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
at this point the dod and that could be

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,560
anything from okay

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
we need someone to make the boots for

219
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
our soldiers

220
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
you know

221
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
they're not just going to go to kmart

222
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,639
and walmart and buy boots they're going

223
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,039
to go to a defense contractor who will

224
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,960
make the boots for them based on certain

225
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
specifications that's a defense

226
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
contractor

227
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,039
okay

228
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
and but there'd also be like okay

229
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
we're going to make an airplane uh

230
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
that's a den being made by a defense

231
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
contractor and that airplane is going to

232
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
have all these other sub components what

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
not made by other companies who were

234
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
also defense contractors

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
so that that's what we're talking about

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
with these defense contractors and you

237
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
know and

238
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,919
they're gonna have to make sure that

239
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,039
their

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,319
systems

241
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,080
meet the security specification to

242
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
protect this data

243
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
so again somebody you know some you know

244
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
definitions i said now that the federal

245
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
contract information basically is what

246
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
it is there's information in the federal

247
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
contracts that need to be safeguarded

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
i think a lot of us when we think about

249
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
this you know we talk about oh

250
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,519
you know there's you know

251
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
classified data you know secret data and

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
whatever

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,760
but we sometimes forget that you know

254
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,720
even if data isn't classified

255
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
you know as secret

256
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
the data still has to be protected you

257
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,399
know most companies

258
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
you know will have like different levels

259
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
of data that they will classify they'll

260
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
say okay this is you know

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
internal use only

262
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
you know there might be general business

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
use only there might be less secure you

264
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,120
know an internal use owner you might be

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
secure but it's less secure than say

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
confidential or proprietary data or so

267
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
forth

268
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,279
um kui is unclassified but it still has

269
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
to be safeguarded

270
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,880
uh because there's information in these

271
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
contracts that you know we don't really

272
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,440
want you know outside people you know

273
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
other countries know about i mean if i

274
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
go and say

275
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
to a company say okay i want you to make

276
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
boots it's gonna be like okay i want you

277
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,560
to make x number boots and this sort of

278
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
stuff

279
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,480
the view is is that the level of data

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
that level information is something that

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
we probably don't want

282
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
a foreign government like so they need

283
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,120
so much boots um that tells us something

284
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,279
about you know the size of their forces

285
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,080
oh look they're changing you know

286
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
you know the kind of boots they want

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,800
that might tell us something so that's

288
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
why this has to be classified but i'm

289
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
sorry that classified has to be

290
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
protected

291
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
um maturity isn't the term that

292
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
we may not you know not everyone has

293
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
been exposed to we hear we think about

294
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
maturity in terms of like you know kids

295
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,279
being more mature or what like that but

296
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
when we're talking about an organization

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,880
we're you know oftentimes

298
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,440
aren't quite sure what's meant by that

299
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,959
but maturity is basically it's a

300
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
measurement of the ability of an

301
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,399
organization

302
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
for continuous improvement in a

303
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
particular discipline

304
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,120
um yes yeah i was exposed to

305
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
you know the capability maturity model

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
which is meant for software but it was

307
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,399
also used for it and there's also a

308
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,560
material model for security

309
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,839
you know so the idea is that there's a

310
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,800
there's this concept you know in it and

311
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
there's a continuous improvement you

312
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,160
know how you do your your job how you

313
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,440
know that's great

314
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
can you continue improve how you do your

315
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
job and do it better

316
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,640
so the idea is that the higher the

317
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,959
maturity the higher will be the chances

318
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
that incidences or errors

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
you know just like oh we messed up is

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,959
that

321
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,680
it will lead to improvements and then

322
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
okay we messed up how can we learn from

323
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
this you know but you need to have

324
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,959
processes in place to make that happen

325
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,120
that you can learn from your mistakes

326
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,000
you know and prove it so that

327
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
you know next time they're less likely

328
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
or they less have an impact on your

329
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
organization you know so that's why you

330
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
want to have a more mature organization

331
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
such that you know oh you get hit by

332
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,160
ransomware yet by malware or some of

333
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
that and you're able to handle that you

334
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
know

335
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,439
get over it and move forward

336
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
so i talked i kind of touched on this

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
you know a little bit in my last

338
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
presentation uh on the sock two reports

339
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,240
and so forth

340
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
but you know third party which is a

341
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
third party or vendor management and

342
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,639
it's it's this concept that's what's

343
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
driving

344
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,040
the reason for the cmmc

345
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
and this has become very very important

346
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,560
you know across the board for a lot of

347
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
companies

348
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
um and you know if you're not really

349
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
looking at the how businesses are now

350
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
operating you know you may be kind of

351
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,360
oblivious to this a little bit but what

352
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
has happened is that

353
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
many many times companies are relying

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,959
upon a variety of third parties i.e

355
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,079
other companies to do services for them

356
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,880
as opposed to doing everything in-house

357
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
you know the old you know to say in the

358
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
old days you know you'd have you'd be

359
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
part of a big corporation and they'd

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
have you know i t was all done in the

361
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,560
house and the data center owned by the

362
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,839
company you know and if you you know

363
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,200
everything was there was their own

364
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
employees so oh you'll have you know hr

365
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
people oh those are those work for the

366
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
company oh you had you know custodial

367
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
people janitors they were they were

368
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
employees of companies and so forth but

369
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
what has happened is in many cases

370
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
you know they've kind of pushed that off

371
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,680
and now you have

372
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,480
you know

373
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,639
hr services being delivered by by

374
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,399
outside companies so

375
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,920
you know i see this audience with big

376
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
companies you know they don't mess they

377
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
have an hr department they go to

378
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
something like an adp and they do all

379
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
their hr through that means you know

380
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,839
they don't own their own data centers

381
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,800
you know they don't have them at their

382
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
own center so

383
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
they then go to a third party

384
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
you know terra mark

385
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,320
rackspace and all the others and say

386
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
okay we're gonna have we're gonna host

387
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
our servers

388
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
in

389
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
these third-party companies or even

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,279
taking it further

391
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,600
we're not even gonna have servers we're

392
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
gonna go and you know virtualize them

393
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
and put them in a cloud vendor like

394
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,040
azure or aws and so forth

395
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
and as you start doing this as you start

396
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,199
relying upon these third parties and

397
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,279
you know

398
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,360
giving them you know your sensitive data

399
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,120
maybe they you know they're just housing

400
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,959
it but still they have that gives them

401
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,320
access to it this becomes

402
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,120
a great deal of concern you know what

403
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
happens to your company that you know

404
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,320
you're you're built entirely on ada aws

405
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,199
and

406
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
you know it go aws goes down you're not

407
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
able to

408
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,959
deliver your services

409
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,320
that's not good

410
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,639
um if you're you if the state is being

411
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,079
housed by a third party and they lose it

412
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
or it's stolen doesn't have an impact on

413
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,000
you and it's like

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,519
and it's all going to be on your head

415
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,480
because

416
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
you want to a third-party service

417
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,519
so because of these concerns about you

418
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,040
know how good is the service they're

419
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,240
providing especially when they have

420
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,720
access to it you need to understand

421
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
how they're doing it are they secure you

422
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
know that data center that you're going

423
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
and relying upon

424
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
you know

425
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
do do they have backup generators and

426
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
all the other servers to ensure that

427
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,320
their services are always being

428
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
delivered to you

429
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,519
you know they may or they may not do

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,680
that but then how do you find that out

431
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,519
and that becomes very very difficult

432
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
um

433
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
so how you have to do is it can be

434
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,279
difficult for some you know they come in

435
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
we'll do like various questionnaires and

436
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,839
so forth you know i don't i've had to

437
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,240
deal with this you know in my in recent

438
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,120
jobs where you know

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
i work for a company we're promoting us

440
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
we're providing services to other

441
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
clients and the clients come to us and

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,079
say like okay before we work with you

443
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
you know here's this long you know

444
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,440
question here and i want you to answer

445
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
all these questions and so forth before

446
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
we decide to work with you do you have

447
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
antivirus do you do backups how often

448
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,839
blah blah blah blah and it becomes a

449
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,440
real

450
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
a lot of work not just for

451
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,959
the company's threat in the service but

452
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,279
also for the companies looking to buy

453
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,680
those services it becomes difficult and

454
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,959
expensive and time-consuming

455
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
so what has been what's happened is that

456
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,880
you know we now are you know

457
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
you were relying more and more on these

458
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,759
you know validated or verified you know

459
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,800
third-party assessment so

460
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
you know company comes to us and say

461
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,839
like hey we want to use your services we

462
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
said like yeah no problem you know we

463
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,199
have

464
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
you know sock 2 we have

465
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,800
you know iso 27001 we have this and the

466
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
other we can then provide them

467
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
evidence of that report and they can say

468
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
oh yeah you have all these things you

469
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
know we're good

470
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,759
let's move forward

471
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
um though again it's a lot of work but

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
you know that way you do one of these

473
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
reports the

474
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
in a year and then you can give it to

475
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,920
all your clients and it's it makes it

476
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
easier

477
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
and so i kind of threw together this

478
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,000
like little list of some of the ones

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
that are out there

480
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,040
that people probably have heard about

481
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,199
you know there's there's pci dss if

482
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,279
you're doing credit cards you've got to

483
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,160
have

484
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,120
you know some kind of a pci assessment

485
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
um there's the sock reports which i

486
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,680
mentioned

487
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,440
in a presentation earlier this year

488
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
though the sock one two and three and

489
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
the cyber security and the cyber

490
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,240
the supply chain

491
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,720
there's the iso 27001 certification

492
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,759
which is an international one for you

493
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,560
know

494
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,399
i.t controls there's high trust which is

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,759
high healthcare

496
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,839
uh there's fedramp you know if you if

497
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,959
you're a cloud

498
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,919
you know

499
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
company wanting to sell in a federal

500
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,039
space you've got to be fed rap

501
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
and to kind of give you a a an

502
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,839
illustration of that

503
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,039
is this is aws's page

504
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,000
of all of the things that they have

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
compliance reports for

506
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,880
you know

507
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
you see cloud service you know see

508
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,280
iso 27001 and 27 0017 which is cloud

509
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,919
specific and one for privacy

510
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,000
and they got pci and they got sock one

511
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
two and three

512
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
and oh now we hear coming to the us we

513
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,400
got fedramp and ferpa and phipps and

514
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,960
high trust and itar and

515
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
so on and so forth this is just on the

516
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
americas and

517
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
japan and every and everyone else all

518
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,480
the other other countries around the

519
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
world you know

520
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
so

521
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
aws you know if they want to do business

522
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
they've got to have all these reports

523
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
and

524
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,320
so i'm sure they literally have

525
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
a department of people that's all they

526
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,039
do

527
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,240
all year round is doing these reports

528
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
it's it's it's a pain

529
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,360
and there are some some general

530
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
characteristics i looked at these is

531
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
that you know

532
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,919
in many cases these uh very various

533
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
assessments are done by

534
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
separate companies who then must be

535
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
approved by some certifying body

536
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
so

537
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
you know like sock two the stock reports

538
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,799
that's that's from aicpa but aicpa isn't

539
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,919
doing this

540
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,760
they approve

541
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,440
various accounting forms to go and do

542
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
this um

543
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
iso

544
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
doesn't go around and certify companies

545
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
for their various iso things there are

546
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,160
various other companies who've been

547
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
approved to go and certify

548
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
you know high trust the actress

549
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,799
organization

550
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,640
you know they don't run around again and

551
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
do high transfer vacations

552
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,280
they have authorized organizations

553
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
and

554
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
in many cases these certifying companies

555
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
that are doing these actual

556
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,600
certifications they must go through

557
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
some rigorous things they may be

558
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
certified themselves

559
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
um they have to maybe meet other certain

560
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
criteria

561
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,799
and if they fail to do so they'll lose

562
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,120
their accreditation which means that

563
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,919
they

564
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,000
lose that on any money that they could

565
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,679
get from going and doing these

566
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
certifications because these

567
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,399
certifications are not cheap

568
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
uh the companies are doing these will

569
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
oftentimes have to have qualified people

570
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
to do the assessors you know again you

571
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
know not just oh yeah i'm i'm a you know

572
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
assessor i can do these assessments in

573
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
many cases

574
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
the assessors have to go through

575
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,720
training and service themselves

576
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,919
and and what's also kind of strange is

577
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
the certifications

578
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
some of them you know expire every year

579
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,840
so it's every year you got to be

580
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,280
recertified but some are you know either

581
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
they last for two years or three years

582
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,039
but that doesn't mean that oh

583
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,280
you know you do it and then like oh

584
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
we'll see in two years

585
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
they will actually will come in at

586
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,559
the midpoint and do kind of a you know

587
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,080
an audit or whatever it's like to make

588
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
sure everything is still running

589
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,919
you know so these these things become

590
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,480
like that very very complex

591
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
um

592
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,600
i wanted to to mention fedramp biggest

593
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,360
you know what i see with fedramp as some

594
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,799
of the some of the things that i see

595
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
with the cmmc

596
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
uh so fedramp is actually the snapram

597
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,080
federal

598
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
risk and authorization management

599
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
program as i said if you're a cloud

600
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,919
service provider

601
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,360
and you want to sell under the federal

602
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,880
space you must be fed ramp approved

603
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,600
you know if you're not then

604
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
too bad so sad i mean that's the way it

605
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
works so what they did was they or they

606
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,600
put together what they what's called the

607
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,360
the joint authorization board jab which

608
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,200
sits under the you know general services

609
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,799
administration so this is

610
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,799
the gsa is a federal agency so the jab

611
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,120
is kind of a federal agency

612
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,720
but you know kind of again what i

613
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,400
mentioned

614
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
the jb doesn't go around and

615
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
and certify anyone what they do is they

616
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
certify

617
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
separate companies which are called

618
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
three paos

619
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
third party assessment organizations

620
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
which they review and they approve and

621
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
they use these the ones that go out and

622
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,200
do the approval now to be a 3pao and

623
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
the company i used to work for we looked

624
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,039
at this so i actually spent some time

625
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,280
looking at what was required to do this

626
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,919
they need to be meet certain criteria

627
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,320
uh as set down by what's called a group

628
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,600
called two a2la

629
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,799
they're based in the accreditation

630
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,799
laboratory uh you know they must have

631
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,480
what's called a qms equality management

632
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,039
system they actually must meet

633
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,480
uh an iso certification called 17020

634
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
which has fedramp specific requirements

635
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,960
and they get this is not a trivial thing

636
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,840
it's like

637
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,520
a one or two year process just to get

638
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,559
that

639
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,840
and then the fed ramp requirements

640
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,760
themselves are based on you know the

641
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
nist sp 853

642
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
control set that you may have heard

643
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
about

644
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,120
so i guess i would just a little

645
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
touching on about mine on this because

646
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
again this kind of ties into

647
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,799
what we're talking about

648
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,159
you guys may have heard about these

649
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,600
different things and people use

650
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
different terms for what's the kind of

651
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,039
same thing so you might have heard of

652
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,000
fisma you might have heard of rmf or the

653
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
risk management framework you might have

654
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
heard of you know sb 853

655
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,400
um

656
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
what this is really is that fisma is

657
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,559
a federal regulation

658
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
that basically requires that federal

659
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
agencies

660
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,200
must develop document and implement

661
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,240
a

662
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
information security program

663
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
on their systems

664
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
um

665
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039
and even if these systems are being

666
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,120
provided or managed by an

667
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
by a contractor it still has to meet

668
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
these requirements and then if you've

669
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
ever looked at 853 it's it's pretty

670
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,000
complex

671
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
so nist

672
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
national institute of standards and

673
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,720
technology they develop the standards

674
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,480
and guidelines through

675
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,120
their 800 series and the phipps

676
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,280
series of publications so if you look at

677
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,880
the 800 the sb 800 series several those

678
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
documents that were created there

679
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
were done to meet fisma

680
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,720
um

681
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,799
883 is happening just to be the control

682
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,760
set

683
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,159
um but it's not the most important

684
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,679
i am not going to list them all there

685
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,840
are a lot of

686
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,640
them uh an important one is 37

687
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,159
which actually defines the wrist

688
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,919
management framework

689
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,760
i mentioned 853

690
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,039
which is now

691
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,520
came up with a revision five

692
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
that's the control set

693
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,400
um

694
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
and it's pretty complex because

695
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,919
depending on the size you know the what

696
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,679
should be the level of security of that

697
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,720
system

698
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,360
determines how much controls you have

699
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
people talk about fisma

700
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,360
high medium and low because of that

701
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,679
because you know and that's why these

702
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,400
other two the fips documents set down

703
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,880
kind of like how much you need to have

704
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,279
there's actually further ones um

705
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,279
there's 53 a b and c a is assessing

706
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,679
b is controlled baselines and i was

707
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
pretty sure they had a c but i couldn't

708
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
find it but you know and these are these

709
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,159
are big documents um

710
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
i should hear the cmmc here being like

711
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,440
you know

712
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
super thick um i think the am 83 is

713
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,840
about as thick as this

714
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,080
so

715
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,799
um there are

716
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,159
17 families of control sets and that's

717
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,919
of them i'm not going to go into them

718
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,760
but most of the things these things here

719
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
look pretty straightforward for those

720
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,760
who are involved in i.t security

721
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
awareness and training okay means you

722
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,080
you make sure people go through security

723
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,440
awareness training pretty

724
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
straightforward contingency plan that

725
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,000
amazing base mean that means you have a

726
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,279
business continuity plan you have a

727
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
disaster recovery plan

728
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,039
you know insta response evidence

729
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,440
response plan if you get you know hit by

730
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,159
hackers or you lose data or you hit by

731
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,520
ransomware

732
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
um media protection that means that you

733
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
have protection in place for

734
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,480
backup media and data and some things

735
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,640
like that uh physical environmental

736
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
protection

737
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,240
you know your physical security controls

738
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,320
you know things like that you know so i

739
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,159
think mostly i think just for the name i

740
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
think if you think about oh yeah you

741
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,760
kind of understand what they're about

742
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,240
now i had

743
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
mentioned

744
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
this one and i need to talk about a

745
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
little bit more it's just it's another

746
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,159
in this segment sp 800

747
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,880
171

748
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
um which was and if you can see the

749
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,080
title of it it's protecting

750
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,200
controlled unclassified information in

751
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,840
non-federal systems and organizations

752
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,679
so basically it's

753
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,200
it sets down how

754
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,159
cuis be protected in non-federal system

755
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,240
an organization basically

756
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,760
your contract you know your federal

757
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,279
contractors

758
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
having kui and what they need to do

759
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,919
protect it and the problem with with and

760
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,520
this is a site this was created as a

761
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,400
subset of 853

762
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,559
um that have 17 controls there's 14

763
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,039
controls you can see a lot of the same

764
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,440
same names very similar

765
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,039
uh but originally and then the problem

766
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,400
with it is that

767
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
contractor just had to self self assess

768
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,600
you know basically was like you know do

769
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,840
you meet this yes or no oh yes we do

770
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,880
yeah okay great yeah that doesn't

771
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
there's no there's no real check on if

772
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
they really have or not you know like

773
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,080
someone could say like oh yes we're

774
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,600
gonna say no and lose out on this

775
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,879
government contract yeah

776
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,360
there's uh some further documents just

777
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,320
to be aware of there's um uh 171a which

778
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
is for assessing the controls um there's

779
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,360
also 172 which is on enhancing it and

780
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,279
you know i'll mention it because it

781
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,159
might be a little confusing is that

782
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,520
originally 172 would be called 171 b

783
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,200
when it was in draft form and was kind

784
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
of frustrating like even in this one

785
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
they didn't update it so they keep

786
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,679
making reference to 121b

787
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,360
which

788
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,720
didn't get released under that name but

789
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,840
i'm not sure why they didn't go through

790
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,399
and update it but

791
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,919
anyway so let's give you some of the

792
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,640
background of what led to this

793
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,240
so because of the issue of having these

794
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
federal contractors

795
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,039
self-assess against it the dod decided

796
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,840
to create the cmmc

797
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
and what they did was which i was a

798
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,440
little bit surprised about was

799
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
instead of going to nist they instead

800
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,520
went to carnegie mellon's

801
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
software engineering institute to

802
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,559
develop it

803
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,399
and what they did was because they

804
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,679
combined

805
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,679
800 171

806
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,640
with

807
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,520
the five level cm cmm that they had

808
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,720
created

809
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,679
and other standards

810
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,640
um and they look how laid them over

811
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,279
five levels within the cmc

812
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,720
um so they included some of these others

813
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
here that you may or may not have heard

814
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,559
about

815
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,480
they announced it in 2019

816
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,320
version 1 came out in early 2020

817
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,600
the current version is like 1.02

818
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,720
so

819
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,840
that's where that stands

820
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,399
um and this is just more of an fyf if

821
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,240
you're not familiar with the cmm this is

822
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
this is the five levels that they have

823
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
the cmm

824
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
you know and it in the idea is that

825
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,080
initially where everyone starts where

826
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,440
you like

827
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
kind of ad hoc and

828
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,600
see your pants type thing level two gets

829
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,520
into manage where you're doing some

830
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,720
processes

831
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,559
define is more further and so forth um

832
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,240
i said i was in an i.t organization we

833
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,919
were assessed at level three that's

834
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,440
probably as good as an i.t organization

835
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
could get um it's really difficult to

836
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
get to level five

837
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,039
but um there are companies out there

838
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,000
they claim they are so

839
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
but anyway

840
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
now

841
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
one thing that was really very different

842
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
and this is this has caused a lot of

843
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,679
people getting all

844
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,320
you know arguing about it and i'm sure

845
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,200
it'll probably never be resolved is that

846
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
unlike with fedramp and this is why it

847
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,640
brought up fedramp

848
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
is that what the dod did was they

849
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,960
authorize

850
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,480
the creation of

851
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,600
the cmmc accreditation body

852
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,440
cnc ab

853
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,679
as an independent

854
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,480
nonprofit organization

855
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,799
so the cmc ab

856
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,960
would be the one managing what they call

857
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,430
the cmc ecosystem

858
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,840
[Music]

859
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,960
but

860
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,720
it's separate from the government was

861
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,200
not like with fedramp where you had a

862
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,880
group that was actually

863
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
a federal body of federal employees

864
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
underneath

865
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
the jsa that it is separate

866
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,399
and

867
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,559
you know if you're curious you can go

868
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
read the articles and people kind of

869
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,919
like saying like this isn't right and

870
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,480
this is this isn't a good idea and so

871
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
forth

872
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,880
but what they've been doing um and it's

873
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,159
it's kind of strange that you know we're

874
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,360
getting to

875
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,279
getting closer to being the maybe around

876
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,880
two years now

877
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,799
is that they would then set up and

878
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,240
establish this whole system that would

879
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,360
include

880
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,679
training for individuals

881
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,559
um

882
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
you know so if you want to be an

883
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,279
assessor

884
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,640
you know there is training to be an

885
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,720
assessor it's a little more complex than

886
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,559
that

887
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,440
because they're going to have it they

888
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,240
have a criteria to certify assessors and

889
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,159
approve practitioners

890
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,679
to establish criteria for what are

891
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,679
called

892
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,600
c3paos and rpos

893
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
you know i'll get into what all this is

894
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,279
they will manage the marketplace for

895
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,480
this ecosystem so it's like okay

896
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
where do i find a list of these

897
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,320
people these

898
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,039
uh

899
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,960
companies and so forth they have a

900
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,640
marketplace uh like i said i'm i'm a

901
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,039
registered practitioner

902
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,240
and so if you were to go to the

903
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,519
marketplace and

904
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,919
do a search you will find me of course

905
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,559
i'm probably gonna drop out because

906
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,960
i'm not part of a an rpo and so

907
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,039
um that's going to expire

908
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,880
they would also conduct quality audits

909
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,320
of the assessments

910
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,240
and they would they would certify you

911
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,799
know submit you know send certifications

912
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,120
to what are called the osc's

913
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,399
organizations seeking certification he

914
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,279
said

915
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
get used to all these acronyms because

916
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,960
they're really big on it

917
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,120
the dod however

918
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,760
they would manage this

919
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,919
the standard as well as the assessment

920
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,480
guides the the accreditation part does

921
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
not do that

922
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
so

923
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,159
so i mentioned training so

924
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,480
there's a lot of really complex and if

925
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,760
you go there with their website you can

926
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,679
see it but i'm trying to like condense

927
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,399
it down a lot overwhelm people but it's

928
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,240
it's really and somebody's like looking

929
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
like this is like really crazy but

930
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
anyway

931
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
so what they what they've done is they

932
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,559
will have

933
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,159
lpps

934
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,960
licensed partner publishers who will

935
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,440
create the training

936
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,240
that people have to go through

937
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,840
and then they will have ltps

938
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,360
licensed training providers who provide

939
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,720
the training

940
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,159
that is that you know that

941
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,159
one will create the training you're like

942
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,480
you know okay we wrote this you know

943
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
syllabus that you will present and the

944
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,039
providers will be the companies that

945
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,399
will provide the training and their

946
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,200
hopes is is this will get out to like oh

947
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
i can go and get the training at my

948
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,559
local community college because they'll

949
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,360
have

950
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,039
you know there'll be

951
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,519
an ltp there versus you know there'll

952
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,799
only be a handful of these companies

953
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,000
further

954
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
the people

955
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
doing the training

956
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,320
have to be

957
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,000
certified instructors

958
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,919
so it's just not like oh yeah i'm a

959
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,279
trainer i can do this sort of stuff it's

960
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,880
like no no no no

961
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
you need i would need to go through

962
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,440
training myself before i can present the

963
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,720
training as a person

964
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,960
so

965
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,159
um and then we have rp's and rp that i'm

966
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,679
an rp

967
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,559
these are registered practitioners are

968
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,919
individuals who

969
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,360
work for what are called registered

970
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,919
provider organizations rpos the company

971
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,880
i used to work for is an rpo

972
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,440
as an rp and i did this

973
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,120
last year is

974
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,039
i had to go through training

975
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,480
i had to be approved actually had to go

976
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,080
through a background check

977
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,760
to be an rpo

978
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,519
and other stuff and

979
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,960
um

980
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,239
and then you know how to complete the

981
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,440
training

982
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
what rps do is they provide what are

983
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,000
called non-certified

984
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,239
advisor services to help an organization

985
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,800
prepare for certification so think of it

986
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,719
this way it's really it's really kind of

987
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,800
simple you got this company

988
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,679
that they their federal contractor

989
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,800
you know

990
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,480
who knows what kind of security program

991
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,119
they have and now they're faced with oh

992
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,119
you need to go get yourself

993
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,719
seem to see certified for at some level

994
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,879
you know and they're like uh

995
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,879
what does that mean i don't know when

996
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,520
you know they look at this you know i

997
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,320
just like i'm confused i need help so

998
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
it's like okay rather than having just

999
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,918
you know

1000
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,280
j random

1001
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
you know

1002
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,440
it expert coming and helping them

1003

you they can go into a regular

1004
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,520
practitioner someone who has gone

1005
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,440
through the training gone through the

1006
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
knowledge they can come in and advise

1007
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,040
them and say like okay oh let me look at

1008
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,320
your system

1009
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,839
okay you know based upon what we know

1010
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,200
these are your gaps this is what you

1011
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,720
need to fix and so forth

1012
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480

what is kind of interesting or kind of

1014
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
weird

1015
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,480
is

1016
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,839
that

1017
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
while a company can both be an rpo and a

1018
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,839
c3po i.e you can have a company can do

1019
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,960
both okay we can help prepare you

1020
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,520
to get certified

1021
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,200
and our company can certify you

1022
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
you can't do both

1023
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,359
for the same company

1024
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,000
yeah that is not allowed you know that's

1025
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,160
in fact a violation of the rules

1026
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,119
because

1027
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,839
the reason for it is quite simple if my

1028
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,440
company went and helped you know

1029
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
access

1030
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,280
you know

1031
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
contracting company to get ready for a

1032
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,599
certification

1033
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,000
if we then came and certified them we're

1034
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
basically

1035
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,599
certifying our own work

1036
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,040
so that's like a no-no you know you can

1037
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,880
do one or the other you can do both with

1038
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
the same company

1039
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,760
um

1040
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
so i think we'll see

1041
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
the case roll there'll be some companies

1042
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
will do both someone's like well we'll

1043
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,160
just help

1044
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
we won't certify and come on by side uh

1045
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,480
we'll just certify we won't help because

1046
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,160
you know they might view it as like oh

1047
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
we're missing out you know because we

1048
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,359
spend all the time helping them and then

1049
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,160
we can't also verify them then we're

1050
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,720
you know missing out

1051
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,440
now companies are not required to go to

1052
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,760
make use of these rps

1053
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,320
and rpos but they're there as a resource

1054
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
and and in my experience and just

1055
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
helping companies with

1056
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,480
getting preparing for them for saw two

1057
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
and high trust and other things having

1058
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,640
so having

1059
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,400
a qualified company coming in and

1060
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,599
helping you

1061
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,960
you know

1062
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,800
get there

1063
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
is very very important

1064
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,800
not every company has a really good

1065
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
security program um they might not have

1066
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,960
people inside that really understand

1067
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
things but having someone come in and

1068
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,480
help them out

1069
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,960
that makes it happen to me it

1070
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,320
makes it much more successful

1071
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
um then we have certified assessors

1072
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,119
which i will be honest do not exist yet

1073
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,119
only they only have provisional

1074
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,160
and

1075
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
here's here's where an area where it

1076
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
gets really complex

1077
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,200
if you're curious about what it what

1078
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
entails become an assessor

1079
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,079
go to this the uh abs website

1080
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,280
um it's

1081
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,760
it's kind of interesting

1082
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,839
so basically they have different levels

1083
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,640
um

1084
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,200
they have the certified professional and

1085
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,680
they have assessor level one three and

1086
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,880
five

1087
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
and here's how it works you know

1088
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
everyone has to get the certified

1089
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,200
professional level

1090
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,320
okay

1091
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
if you want to

1092
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,320
assess the company at level one you then

1093
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,000
need to get a professional level and

1094
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,520
then you need

1095
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,119
to do level one

1096
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,880
you know assessor level certification

1097
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,640
if you want to certify a company level

1098
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
three great you need to get the

1099
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,000
professional

1100
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
then you need to get level one

1101
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
and then you need to level three

1102
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,560
and then for your level three you can do

1103
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,200
a level one two or three uh

1104
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
certification

1105
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
and same thing with five

1106
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,079
however

1107
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,880
um if you have to get a little essay is

1108
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,079
not only is there different levels of

1109
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,000
training there's also experience

1110
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,359
requirements

1111
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,680
and so forth that needs to be met so you

1112
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,280
know before you can become a level one

1113
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,400
assessor

1114
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
you have to be you have to actually

1115
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,359
participate

1116
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,680
in so many assessments and the same

1117
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,040
thing for level three before you get

1118
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,160
level three

1119
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,079
you need to do so many

1120
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,920
you know level three assessment just as

1121
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,800
a participant so to speak before you get

1122
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
certified there there's also requests

1123
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
about citizenship you have to be us

1124
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,760
citizen

1125
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
there's background requirements

1126
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,040
and

1127
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,200
at the higher levels

1128
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,839
security clearances

1129
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,280
um so

1130
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,359
there's a lot to it and at this point

1131
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,520
they just have the provisional assessors

1132
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,119
that just they haven't even released the

1133
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,240
training

1134
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,880
yet for these different levels

1135
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,400
in addition

1136
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,720
they're certified instructors

1137
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,079
master instructor we use the trainers

1138
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,280
okay and for them to be an instructor

1139
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,359
you have to go through

1140
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,520
professional level one and three and

1141
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,800
five

1142
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,760
okay

1143
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,079
and then there's the quality auditors

1144
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,839
these will be people who will work will

1145
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,440
be employees

1146
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
of

1147
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,320
the

1148
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,440
board

1149
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,280
because they will do quality audits of

1150
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
the certification

1151
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,240
after you know once the work has been

1152
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,200
done they will then check that out

1153
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
so

1154
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,680
it's really complex um i also understand

1155
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,359
they will all

1156
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,960
all certification will last for a year

1157
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
but it's not clear to me

1158
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,880
how do you get recertified

1159
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,960
do we have to do

1160
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,560
continuing education

1161
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,040
do we have to do experience uh that's

1162
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,200
that's unclear yeah like for my

1163
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,040
certifications it's very clear what i

1164
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,680
need to do to maintain it and where

1165
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,960
these

1166
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,319
i don't know yet

1167
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,359
so it's pretty complex

1168
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,160
i mentioned the c3paos and these are

1169
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,520
organizations that the assessor will

1170
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,960
work for you you're not you cannot be

1171
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,680
independent you must work for for a

1172
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
c-3po and they

1173
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,599
must also meet some big criteria they

1174
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,359
have to be u.s owned

1175
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,440
they can't be foreign owned

1176
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,119
hopefully that's obvious but yeah just

1177
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,079
in case

1178
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,839
um they have to meet certain financial

1179
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,119
checks on them

1180
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,040
uh they themselves as like as an

1181
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,400
organization

1182
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,160
must get iso something o2o certified

1183
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,640
they as an organization must also be

1184
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,440
level three certified

1185
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,359
you know so there's a lot of there's a

1186
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,960
lot to it so

1187
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,599
there there are no as far as i know this

1188
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,240
point there are no c3paos at this point

1189
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,119
there are rpos but there's no

1190
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,599
c3pas at this point

1191
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,480
um

1192
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,680
so

1193
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,280
hopefully i'm not confused everyone at

1194
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,040
this point on all this sort of kind of

1195
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,760
background so that's going to delve into

1196
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,040
the cmc itself

1197
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,440
so what they've done is they've created

1198
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,040
this as five levels

1199
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,119
uh they they call it without the other

1200
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,920
processes which is performed documented

1201
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,520
managed reviewed optimizing

1202
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,240
there's the practices so number one is

1203
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
basically what they call basic cyber

1204
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,599
security

1205
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,079
you know two is intermediate three is

1206
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,520
good

1207
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,599
and four is proactive and five is

1208
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,800
advanced

1209
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
um

1210
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,960
the focus as i said is that for one

1211
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
that's for just

1212
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,440
hey

1213
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,280
we want you to safeguard the contract

1214
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,400
information

1215
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
um

1216
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,200
two

1217
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,000
was

1218
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,800
was really really only created as a

1219
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,200
halfway point to three

1220
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,240
um

1221
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,160
because the way it works for all of

1222
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,079
these is that depending on the contracts

1223
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,960
it will require one of these levels

1224
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,839
so

1225
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,040
if you're like

1226
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,079
if your company is just making boots

1227
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,160
let's be honest here it's probably level

1228
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,200
one

1229
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
you know basic stuff

1230
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,760
um whereas if you're doing something

1231
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,680
more serious like you're building

1232
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,040
you know

1233
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
important like radio components or

1234
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
you know some of that that's right

1235
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,319
you'll be like a level three at least

1236
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,280
um

1237
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,119
and what what i had heard in some of the

1238
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,400
the meetings and what you know that i've

1239
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,240
been to with cmmc people is you know

1240
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,480
a lot of contracts should be level one

1241
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,000
a lot of kind of level three

1242
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,480
so they you know the kind of implied you

1243
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,560
will not see any any contract requiring

1244
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,480
level two

1245
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,800
level four and five would be very rare

1246
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,560
these would be one for like you know

1247
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,920
kind of like very

1248
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,560
sensitive stuff like okay we want you to

1249
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
you know like the company's gonna write

1250
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,280
the the guidance software for missiles

1251
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,760
something like that that would be a

1252
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,400
a four or five

1253
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,560
you know you can see here like one is

1254
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,359
contract information three is protecting

1255
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,839
kui and then four and five is more

1256
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,920
advanced where it's also hey

1257
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,119
you know had you know reducing apts

1258
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,079
um

1259
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,240
two was created basically just a halfway

1260
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
to three to make it

1261
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
make it more palatable as opposed to

1262
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,920
okay if your company has to be three

1263
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,119
you know

1264
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,280
let's not scare you like you had to jump

1265
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,400
straight to three it's like okay

1266
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,599
do one

1267
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,200
get it okay move the two get two done

1268
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,720
and move to three gonna make it a little

1269
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,200
more palatable

1270
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,880
sorry michael let me i'm sorry because

1271
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
this is this is pretty good

1272
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,960
yeah so so let's say i have like

1273
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,520
licensed drivers

1274
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,640
of

1275
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,880
dod people where should i be a five

1276
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,400
or a three

1277
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,640
probably a one you know like it's all

1278
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,560
about the security needed for what

1279
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,319
you're doing

1280
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,720
you know

1281
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,119
right what if i was like an article in

1282
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,760
microsoft

1283
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,280
the funny thing is is if you're just

1284
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,400
providing

1285
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,520
commercial off the shelf software

1286
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,560
you don't have to worry about cnmc

1287
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,520
really

1288
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,240
yeah so if if only it's like okay we're

1289
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,000
going to go and buy

1290
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
microsoft word

1291
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,160
that's just commercial office official

1292
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,839
software

1293
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,400
um with oracle if it's more like you're

1294
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,839
providing you know you're using the

1295
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,400
oracle's uh cloud services

1296
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,079
that's more fedramp

1297
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,920
than than cmc

1298
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,319
i see

1299
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,480
great i mean what kind of frustrating is

1300
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,839
is they haven't really done it really i

1301
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,520
mean i've gone to some of the the town

1302
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,440
halls and whatnot and you know they kind

1303
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,280
of kind of talked about kind of the

1304
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
samples but it was kind of frustrating

1305
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,400
at this point they're kind of like just

1306
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,520
kind of big examples because they

1307
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,720
haven't

1308
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,400
they're just barely

1309
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
implementing this at this point

1310
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,800
you know because they haven't ramped up

1311
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,880
where you've got it you know

1312
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
the the whole assessors in place and

1313
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,280
this sort of stuff you know you can't

1314
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,119
you can at this point say like okay you

1315
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,160
need to be

1316
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
one or three or whatever level you know

1317
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,960
is that still they're still

1318
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,720
you know they're slowly ramping up and

1319
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
it's not to the point where you know

1320
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,319
it's easy to understand what these

1321
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,119
different levels are

1322
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,200
which is

1323
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,880
frustrating uh this is again you know

1324
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,200
this is a slide you know taking roxy

1325
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,520
from you know the book you know kind of

1326
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,560
showing the different layers they have

1327
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,480
these domains domains would be things

1328
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
such as you know training

1329
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
you know media control and so forth and

1330
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,319
then they have you know processes

1331
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,800
capabilities and practices that can be

1332
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,760
that are

1333
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
leveled across these things

1334
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,079
uh to kind of define what you need to be

1335
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,359
doing

1336
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,560
um

1337
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
so here is the kind of inspection of the

1338
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,000
processes

1339
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,040
so

1340
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,839
and this is going to be interesting is

1341
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,599
that when you're at level one

1342
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,119
there actually isn't any maturity

1343
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,920
processes okay it's like it's even

1344
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,319
almost shocking when i'm looking like

1345
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,280
like

1346
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,119
you don't even have to have

1347
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,040
written policies if you're at level one

1348
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,119
policies don't come in until level two

1349
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,280
so you know the idea is that you can you

1350
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,000
can be kind of very ad hoc because you

1351
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,680
know it's what you're kind of doing

1352
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,240
isn't isn't you know super super

1353
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
critical we need to have some basics and

1354
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,560
so they want to maybe create an undue

1355
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,880
burden on these i mean i said this would

1356
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,200
be like we said the company that's

1357
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,560
making making you know boots so you know

1358
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,319
some basic stuff

1359
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,720
and you're good

1360
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,400
versus you're doing a much more you're

1361
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,160
much you're doing like radio components

1362
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,920
and this sort of stuff which means you

1363
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,000
need to be you have to have much more in

1364
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,880
place

1365
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,560
so like at level two you have to have a

1366
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,599
policy

1367
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,760
you have to have you know how you're

1368
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,599
gonna implement that policy

1369
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,520
and then more more that you know for

1370
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,040
level three

1371
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,880
you know have it but also resource a

1372
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,839
plan

1373
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,920
so there's more things and then four

1374
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,119
you're doing things like you're

1375
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,280
measuring your effectiveness

1376
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,640
how good are you

1377
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,440
at

1378
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,520
patching your systems you know things

1379
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,640
like that

1380
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,280
you know so i guess it gets more complex

1381
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,599
but again i said four or five or more

1382
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,680
more they told me it's more rare you

1383
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,280
know one and three are more likely but

1384
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,119
again it's depending upon you know the

1385
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,280
type of contracts so there's a lot of

1386
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,280
companies that will just have type of

1387
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,280
the work they do they're gonna they're

1388
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,920
always gonna have need level one because

1389
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,680
that's that's the type of

1390
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,760
you know working in their due whereas

1391
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,599
others will be at level three

1392
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,520
and probably never need to go any higher

1393
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,280
just because of the type of work that

1394
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,680
they do

1395
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,119
um this is the one that kind of again

1396
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,319
taken from the book showing kind of the

1397
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,079
levels but this is the next thing it

1398
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,480
shows where they pull these things from

1399
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,760
so

1400
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,760
level one they basically pull from this

1401
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,000
document called the federal acquisition

1402
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,880
regulation you know far regulations so

1403
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,720
that's where these practices are whereas

1404
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
it said level two and three they pulled

1405
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,160
in the stuff from

1406
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,040
you know

1407
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,559
171 and it's almost like they took

1408
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,480
some of them at level two and the rest

1409
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,240
in level three

1410
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,000
and then and four and five they started

1411
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,680
adding in more

1412
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,559
important practices to make it more more

1413
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,960
secure

1414
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
uh this one is interesting because it

1415
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,720
kind of shows

1416
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,079
you know these sort of practices how

1417
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,599
they kind of

1418
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,160
you know layered them over the different

1419
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
levels you know like here we have access

1420
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,960
control where it goes from level one to

1421
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,280
level five all the way across but

1422
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,880
there's some where

1423
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,040
they don't even exist at level one and i

1424
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,960
was actually kind of surprised by this

1425
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,319
you know

1426
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,480
awareness and training

1427
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,160
isn't needed at level one i was kind of

1428
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,440
shocked by that

1429
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,280
because i i kind of view you know

1430
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,559
security awareness training as being

1431
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,599
kind of you know universal but if you're

1432
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,079
a level one organization

1433
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:26,720
it's

1434
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,559
not required

1435
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,680
um

1436
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,359
so you know it's it's kind of it's kind

1437
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,760
of surprising you know

1438
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,200
some of the things that aren't needed at

1439
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,280
level one you know they wanted very you

1440
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
know kind of the very basic

1441
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,240
you know

1442
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,240
things to go with and then it's like

1443
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,000
okay level two things really start

1444
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,559
kicking in at level three and as i said

1445
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,359
most there'll be a lot of companies

1446
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,280
their contracts will be at level one and

1447
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,720
a lot will be at level three and of

1448
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
course again these these add on so if

1449
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,079
you're at level three

1450
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,920
you need to do everything at one two and

1451
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,440
three

1452
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,319
so

1453
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,759
but this to me was kind of surprising

1454
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,480
um

1455
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,960
and actually i said i've got uh we're

1456
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,119
gonna actually take a look at you know

1457
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,280
what is in these these documents so you

1458
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,960
get i think you'll get a good idea of

1459
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,119
this so i want to take a look at that

1460
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,040
what we mean by level one the basic

1461
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,440
hygiene so you know think of this like

1462
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,599
processes you know

1463
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,400
they're

1464
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,559
you know where do they perform specified

1465
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,559
practices

1466
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,400
um because the organization may only be

1467
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
able to perform these practices in an ad

1468
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,160
hoc manner

1469
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,319
and may or may not rely on documentation

1470
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,240
there's no process maturity so

1471
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,079
they kind of kind of view that for basic

1472
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,880
hygiene they can just

1473
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,720
do the best they can and then they'll be

1474
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,839
okay

1475
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,280
um as that documentation

1476
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,520
isn't required at lead level one

1477
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,400
um

1478
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,200
which again is of surprising um this is

1479
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,720
actually all the ones that were at level

1480
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,839
one uh access control

1481
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,079
you know which in innovation and

1482
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,920
automation which have the basic things

1483
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,000
you know who your users are you kind of

1484
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,599
have some controls under what they can

1485
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,720
access

1486
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,800
immediate protection um

1487
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,480
you know you destroy media when you're

1488
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,240
when you're done with it okay that's

1489
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,359
pretty basic uh physical protection you

1490
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,960
know you limit physical access you know

1491
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,680
you ask where visitors have visitor logs

1492
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,319
so that's pretty basic

1493
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,760
uh system communication due to

1494
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,280
monitoring control

1495
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,240
uh system and information integrity this

1496
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,599
is things like

1497
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,319
your patching systems you have malware

1498
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,640
yeah you have antivirus and

1499
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,480
you do basically nobody's hand that's

1500
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,119
that's pretty simple my hopefully most

1501
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,160
companies could do that

1502
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,880
so at this point let me pull up

1503
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,680
the three documents so this yeah you

1504
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,359
guys can see it this is

1505
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,079
um the main document which actually

1506
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,920
isn't that that long

1507
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,359
um i think it's like 23 pages

1508
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,440
we told

1509
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,920
yeah 23 pages for the basic but it

1510
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,520
doesn't get into a lot of depth this is

1511
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,359
system and system and information

1512
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,160
entirely si

1513
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,960
um

1514
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,359
so level one needs these things and so

1515
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,599
forth so if you look at level you know

1516
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,920
identify report and correct information

1517
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,520
system flaws

1518
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,720
basically

1519
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
we're talking about patching

1520
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,040
you know what what you need to patch and

1521
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,599
you apply the patches

1522
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,640
okay

1523
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,079
uh provide protection from malicious

1524
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,040
code

1525
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,000
okay

1526
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,920
anti-malware

1527
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,079
uh update let's just code

1528
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,119
okay

1529
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,200
you know you have anti-malware you make

1530
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,119
sure it's managed so it's being updated

1531
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,400
with new deaths

1532
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,520
okay

1533
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,480
and then i said perform prayer scans

1534
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,599
um

1535
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,160
okay that's a bonus scan real-time

1536
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,000
handle files from external sources as

1537
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
files are downloaded

1538
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,640
um

1539
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,720
most sandy malware that i've seen for

1540
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,720
last several years we'll do that for you

1541
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,319
you know you know you do and download

1542
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,440
something the anti-malware goes like

1543
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
okay let me take a look at that first

1544
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,880
yeah

1545
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,920
so

1546
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,760
that that's what you know of course and

1547
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,000
this is the basic document that's

1548
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,240
all there is of course we as it people

1549
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,640
are going to like uh i want some more

1550
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,599
you know

1551
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,680
let's let's see some more depth

1552
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,920
so the appendices have the more in-depth

1553
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,240
stuff so each of these ones here

1554
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,760
they spend like

1555
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,480
depending on on them like a page

1556
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,319
or two or three going into more in depth

1557
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:33,920
but this is where we get the appendices

1558
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,839
where we get at least for people like

1559
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,800
ourselves to understand it so this is

1560
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,040
that ended by reporting correct system

1561
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,760
flaws so they have a discussion taken

1562
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,800
from 171

1563
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,440
they have some clarification

1564
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,160
you know to kind of explain it i guess

1565
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,640
think about layman's turns and they give

1566
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,280
they usually give some examples

1567
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,520
you know

1568
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,480
um

1569
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,400
and using them pretty basic like you

1570
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
know you have many responses at your

1571
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,480
company including i.t you know that

1572
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,559
malware ransomware browsers can be big

1573
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,480
problems you make sure to enable all

1574
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,960
security updates for your software

1575
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,880
through the operating system

1576
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,720
okay

1577
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,319
but and then that's it and of course

1578
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,920
they give you some references

1579
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,520
um

1580
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,800
and so we're for the other ones in

1581
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,640
dealing with malware and that's and

1582
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,319
that's what's in here

1583
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,400
um the other one i brought up here is

1584
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,920
this is actually

1585
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,079
the assessment guide

1586
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,640
from the dod so if

1587
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,799
i'm the guy coming in

1588
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,599
to your company to assess you

1589
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,520
to see if you're meeting these

1590
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,000
this is what i mean i need to be using

1591
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,319
to kind of check you out

1592
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,160
so you know in the end this is the same

1593
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,799
one the identify report and correct you

1594
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,839
know the system flaws in a timely manner

1595
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,240
so what

1596
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,680
should i be looking for

1597
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,000
okay did you set down

1598
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,960
you know

1599
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,040
when you identify these and the time

1600
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,160
frame

1601
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,040
um

1602
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,799
when you get a report on it we're going

1603
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:07,920
to correct it

1604
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,200
um

1605
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
and if i get if you if some of you have

1606
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,760
experience with patching of systems

1607
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,599
you know this is pretty standard in

1608
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,359
terms of you say okay

1609
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,280
if it's a critical patch

1610
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,359
that we get reported we will patch it

1611
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,319
within

1612
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,359
a week

1613
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,400
if it's

1614
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,079
you know

1615
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,200
a medium you know severity

1616
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,839
we'll give it a month and it's a low

1617
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,200
you know

1618
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,720
two or three months

1619
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,839
you know

1620
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,520
and you you would have that written down

1621
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
in some some place you know you're most

1622
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
likely your procedures

1623
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,520
so that's what was talking about is that

1624
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,799
hey

1625
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,400
have you sat down

1626
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,760
we need to be checking these things out

1627
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,359
and then i'm going to have to validate

1628
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,760
that you know you've got this this down

1629
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,359
that you're doing it

1630
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,599
so that's how that would work and they

1631
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,520
even have here in terms like you know

1632
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,880
examples and so forth like you know

1633
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,200
getting getting data how you would test

1634
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,359
it you know what you would who would you

1635
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,760
ask you know you talk to

1636
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,880
you know the system and network

1637
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,680
administrators and so forth you know so

1638
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,520
they

1639
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,119
they don't handhold you but at least

1640
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,559
they they set down

1641
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,040
some guidance to make sure hey

1642
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,440
this thing's being done properly

1643
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,920
so that's what the assessment guide does

1644
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,200
um and there's an assessment guide at

1645
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,319
this point for for level one level three

1646
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,839
um i don't think they've done it for

1647
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,680
four and five yet

1648
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,480
so

1649
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,680
that's what we have at this point

1650
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,040
and again these are all these are all

1651
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,799
pds that you can you can get from the

1652
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,000
dod's

1653
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,280
website for this

1654
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,079
um i started finding a decent slide on

1655
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,240
this but this one is i guess is okay

1656
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,680
andrew like

1657
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,000
how it works so in terms of getting

1658
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,480
certified in the cmc

1659
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,720
so that you would be

1660
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,160
you know the gap assessment this would

1661
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,480
probably be either the company would

1662
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,559
look at themselves and say like you know

1663
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,880
where's our gaps what do we need to fix

1664
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,960
or if they were bringing a third party

1665
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,040
you know that registered professional

1666
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,640
they come in and say oh let's say okay

1667
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,319
we looked at this this is your your gaps

1668
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,480
you need to address these you fix those

1669
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,920
gaps

1670
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,640
you add new tools in system and whatnot

1671
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,079
at that point you have the audit and

1672
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,559
certification this is where

1673
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,480
you bring in

1674
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,880
you know the certified assessor they do

1675
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,520
the formal assessment

1676
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,760
once they've done their assessment

1677
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,000
you know put together that report

1678
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,839
that gets sent to

1679
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,440
the accreditation board for their

1680
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,960
quality audit

1681
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,160
to make sure

1682
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,920
it was done properly you know and

1683
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,200
they haven't yet done it but i'm just

1684
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
basing this in my experience with you

1685
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,160
know with how high trust does it is you

1686
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:52,960
know

1687
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,640
the

1688
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,400
audit and whatnot where the work being

1689
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,520
done by

1690
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,319
um

1691
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,480
you know the assessor is usually

1692
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,400
you know can be like a couple of months

1693
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
of evidence gathering examination and so

1694
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,599
forth and then you turned over quality

1695
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,160
audit that's going to be another

1696
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,640
you know month or so period as people

1697
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,000
take a look at it

1698
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,680
and then hopefully if you didn't do it

1699
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,319
well hope you extra certification

1700
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,119
but

1701
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,440
it shouldn't be like okay we're done

1702
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,680
we're certified you want to make sure

1703
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,880
hey

1704
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,799
you know let's work on improving and

1705
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,000
doing better

1706
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,559
so that when we

1707
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,720
when they come along the next time

1708
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,000
that you know it'll be smooth sailing

1709
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,520
yeah that's that's true of all these

1710
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,280
sort of assessments you don't just like

1711
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,119
okay boom we're done

1712
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,880
um and what i mean i'm even kind of

1713
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,200
puzzling is that

1714
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,799
at least it's not clear to me with cmmc

1715
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,280
but when i look at others is

1716
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,799
it's

1717
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,640
not so much a pass fail that's where in

1718
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,119
some ways that you get a pass fail but

1719
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,640
you know it's not like

1720
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,240
you have to be a hundred percent and you

1721
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,319
get a certification you know it could be

1722
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,040
like if it was like a

1723
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,280
0 to 100

1724
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,640
it's more like if you scored and you

1725
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,559
were at like 75

1726
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,960
or higher you get certified

1727
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,839
but that's the thing you weren't at 100

1728
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,680
you were at 75

1729
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,799
um

1730
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,720
so you want to make sure hey let's make

1731
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,240
it a little stronger

1732
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,440
next time

1733
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,680
so that you know

1734
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,960
you can better pass it you know you

1735
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,160
don't necessarily have to have to be at

1736
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,359
100

1737
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,280
but

1738
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,559
better yet you know 80 versus

1739
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,520
that

1740
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,520
you know

1741
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,079
75 percent cut off or whatever it may be

1742
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,760
um and that's not clear to me with

1743
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,119
seeing the cmc yet

1744
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,920
so where where are things going um

1745
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,359
as i kind of alluded to at the beginning

1746
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,599
there has been a lot of issues raised

1747
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
about the accreditation board and so

1748
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,960
forth yeah

1749
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,559
um

1750
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,000
i was sort of like familiar with that

1751
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,839
because you know my company was looking

1752
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,040
at becoming

1753
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,040
you know an rpo and we were talking

1754
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,680
about having a c3pao uh i don't think

1755
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,160
whatever won that route um so i was

1756
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,520
looking at it i was clearly i was going

1757
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,480
to become

1758
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,720
you know an rp and if we went that route

1759
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,480
i was figuring looking at like what

1760
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,400
would it take for me to become

1761
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,720
one of these certified assessors um

1762
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,920
looking at it when they have the

1763
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,760
training when they have the training

1764
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,680
you know we try to become

1765
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,200
i think some of us had applied to be

1766
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,359
provisional assessors and didn't get

1767
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,599
picked

1768
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,559
um

1769
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,920
you know so we were kind of looking at

1770
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,000
that and i was looking at their timeline

1771
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,920
and whatnot this is again this is you

1772
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,160
know last year thinking like okay from

1773
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,680
what they're telling us

1774
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,680
um i think they'll start rolling out the

1775
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,160
training at the end of you know

1776
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,440
2020

1777
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,640
and

1778
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,240
didn't happen

1779
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,000
um in fact i was a little annoyed about

1780
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,680
how long it took for us

1781
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,640
to get the training to be an rp

1782
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,559
and here we are in

1783
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,559
you know here we are october

1784
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,240
2021

1785
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,319
and

1786
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,319
the training for the vegan assessor

1787
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,319
still isn't out there

1788
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,839
you know the the lower level the

1789
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,079
professional one i think is about to be

1790
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,640
coming out but the the assessor that

1791
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,880
follow that

1792
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,319
isn't there

1793
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,079
um

1794
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,160
so that's the thing there i don't think

1795
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,839
they've approved any

1796
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:24,559
c3paos um

1797
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,680
training forest has not been released

1798
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,720
um

1799
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,200
we all have provisional assessors

1800
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,040
um

1801
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,880
so it's like it's not quite clear where

1802
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,079
that is um again a lot of things that

1803
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,520
were brought up was the fact that the a

1804
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,839
b is an independent body online with how

1805
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,359
they did with fedramp

1806
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,480
and so there was a lot of questions

1807
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,160
being brought up yeah welcome maybe

1808
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,680
that's a good question a lot of concern

1809
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,200
about like you know

1810
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,880
uh pay for play and you know who this

1811
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,359
person in bed with that person and you

1812
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,880
know

1813
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,440
a lot of things i've had that were in

1814
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,440
the press that i was i was seeing so

1815
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,160
it's it's really

1816
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,839
i think some of there was actually some

1817
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,960
shakeouts there's people that that

1818
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,280
left the board and new people came on

1819
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,760
board and it was like

1820
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,799
okay

1821
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,559
why did that person leave or they pushed

1822
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,839
out asked leave you know it was

1823
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,720
it was it was it was pretty crazy

1824
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,319
um

1825
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,680
yeah the dod is doing a review of the

1826
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,200
default rule that relates to cmc um

1827
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,680
yeah so i i'm you know i think this is

1828
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,200
gonna be a really good thing but it's

1829
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,640
really complex

1830
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,319
and i'm not sure

1831
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,079
when we're gonna see you know the

1832
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,480
training there and assessors actually

1833
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,200
there and contracts requiring it and so

1834
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,480
forth

1835
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,599
and

1836
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,000
i also wonder and i said at the

1837
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,440
beginning is

1838
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,440
at this point this is just for dod

1839
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,039
contractors

1840
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,480
you know

1841
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,119
what happens

1842
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,839
you know and of course into during win

1843
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,359
it becomes that

1844
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,000
uh it's not just dod contracts but any

1845
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,920
federal contracts

1846
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,000
would require it

1847
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,720
and one thing i also started wondering

1848
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,520
because again you know the you know

1849
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,160
fisma and if you will 853

1850
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,880
is intended for federal systems

1851
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,839
but i am aware of various

1852
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,559
state level systems that make use of

1853
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,200
853

1854
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,640
so

1855
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,799
i started thinking like okay

1856
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,119
you know we got the cmc it's only for

1857
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,599
dod

1858
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,119
at some point it's gonna be for federal

1859
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,400
systems

1860
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,680
um

1861
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,760
could we see it

1862
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,119
be asked

1863
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,319
for

1864
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,240
contractors at the state level at some

1865
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,839
point

1866
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,079
i don't know um

1867
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,559
i i i would find it hard to believe that

1868
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:59,520
every

1869
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,599
you know state level contrary would have

1870
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,079
to have it but i could i could see

1871
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,559
certain types of state contracts being

1872
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,280
asked for but

1873
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,240
stranger things could happen but um so

1874
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,160
hopefully that helps uh if you're

1875
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,319
curious you know you can go to

1876
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,079
the the abs website you know cmcab.org

1877
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,640
uh and get overwhelmed by all the the

1878
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,720
stuff on all the different you know

1879
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,520
you know

1880
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,160
assessors and what all it takes and so

1881
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,039
forth

1882
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,640
um

1883
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,079
the i said the dod controls the

1884
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,680
the model and the assessment guides and

1885
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,680
you can go to that website and you can

1886
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,920
download and and read all the material

1887
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,520
like that i have my current copy that

1888
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,280
this is your ps and

1889
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,039
if you want to read through it and and

1890
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,480
just you know

1891
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,359
have your eyes glaze over um

1892
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,760
have fun

1893
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,960
i'm kind of using it because i read a

1894
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,160
lot of this sort of stuff but even then

1895
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,880
for me as i like oh god it's just

1896
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,480
so boring but

1897
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,880
it is what it is

1898
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,359
um so any any questions at this point

1899
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,480
see i

1900
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,960
know that's not what i want to do

1901
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,000
how do i stop sharing

1902
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,720
i have a question um disregarding

1903
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,960
nist uh sp 800-171

1904
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,640
um

1905
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,879
how

1906
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,680
if you are under this

1907
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,760
how do you enforce this do you have to

1908
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,160
hire a person like you do you need to

1909
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,200
hire

1910
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,799
you mention something you can't do your

1911
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,480
own assessment so

1912
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,240
well there's different ways that

1913
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,799
the companies could do it i mean even

1914
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,200
you know with um

1915
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,319
you know some of the companies that i

1916
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,599
was working with

1917
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,200
um

1918
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,640
you know one problem that i've seen you

1919
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,160
know again with all the clients i was

1920
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,799
dealing with as a security assessor is

1921
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,760
that you know a lot of companies were

1922
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,400
they only had like maybe

1923
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,920
two or three

1924
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,200
um

1925
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,599
you know i t people

1926
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,640
and

1927
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,839
you know

1928
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,680
they didn't have you know

1929
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,240
and sometimes the the bandwidth or or

1930
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,359
the money

1931
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,160
to hire like say a full-time compliance

1932
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,280
person that would that would manage this

1933
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,200
so

1934
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,119
the final thing was was it was you know

1935
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,359
some of the work that i was doing

1936
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,440
for some of the clients was

1937
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,599
you know i was i was hired as a

1938
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,400
consultant you know for them as a as a

1939
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,039
virtual cso or this sort of stuff and so

1940
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,280
to a degree i was

1941
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,599
i was like the virtual compliance

1942
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:38,799
officer

1943
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:42,000
you know i i wasn't full-time but i was

1944
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,400
you know making sure that evidence was

1945
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,760
being out that they were implementing

1946
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,440
things you know i went in for some

1947
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,520
clients maybe you know develop the

1948
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,119
policies and put them in place and

1949
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,799
making sure that you know their aim

1950
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,920
planning and this and stuff so

1951
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,839
you know more so for smaller companies i

1952
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,000
can certainly see them and then we see

1953
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,319
that already where you have companies

1954
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,039
who

1955
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,200
outsource their entire i.t

1956
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,280
they have no i.t people they have some

1957
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,520
third-party i.t company

1958
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,720
you have the concept of

1959
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,480
you know we talk about software as a

1960
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,319
service but there's people we talk we

1961
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,520
talk about

1962
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,280
security as a service

1963
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,559
so

1964
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,119
you you have a small company you know

1965
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,960
you've outsourced your it because you

1966
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,039
just don't have enough you know you

1967
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,440
can't afford to hire full-time i.t

1968
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,480
people

1969
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,160
you could hire you know a company to be

1970
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,520
your

1971
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,559
your security staff you know your stock

1972
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,440
you know

1973
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,079
that can do this i you you you may have

1974
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,359
said this because there's there is the

1975
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,839
concept and it is kind of accepted that

1976
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,000
you have the concept of a fractional

1977
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,599
virtual cso

1978
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,359
so i can certainly see for small

1979
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,680
companies that you would have a

1980
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,520
you know a fractional

1981
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,200
you know virtual

1982
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,640
you know compliance officer for

1983
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,480
compliance group that would come in

1984
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,440
you know

1985
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,960
fix things up for them making sure they

1986
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,520
have the processes in place and then

1987
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,039
be the one going to kind of check on

1988
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,640
them to make sure things are being done

1989
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,400
properly versus

1990
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,640
you know hiring a full-time person

1991
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,399
that you really couldn't justify doing

1992
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,719
yeah that's that's how i would see it

1993
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,799
right and to agree this whole idea of

1994
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,960
the registered professional

1995
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,279
you know the purpose for that for such a

1996
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:26,960
person is you got someone who is

1997
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,120
knowledgeable in the cmmc who's going to

1998
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,520
come in and help your organization

1999
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,960
um

2000
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,279
and i could see it even where

2001
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,479
you know

2002
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,040
that person you know because they

2003
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,719
they and their company can't be the one

2004
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,198
certifying you is they would be involved

2005
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,719
you may be involved with that company

2006
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,640
and help them get certified you know

2007
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,319
maybe working with the certifying

2008
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,719
company and then when they got certified

2009
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,120
you know you could keep that person

2010
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,479
around and say

2011
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,000
hey you know

2012
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,600
keep you know say around and help make

2013
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,719
sure

2014

we stay good

2015
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,920
you know because in degree that's kind

2016
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,198
of what i did with some clients where

2017
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,080
okay i help them get the other stock too

2018
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,198
right there but they're going to come

2019
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,040
around the next year to do it so

2020
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,158
you know

2021
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,238
let's make sure that

2022
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,080
things are going smoothly

2023
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,120
for the next go around

2024
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,920
that's great um let me ask you one more

2025
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,120
thing

2026
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,880
let's say i am

2027
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,359
i participate in a bit

2028
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,080
right let's say i participate in a bid

2029
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,439
for a component or a new weapon or a new

2030
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,439
weapon system or

2031
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:36,238
something cyber right the

2032
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,839
a branch of the

2033
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,839
dod wants to develop

2034
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:40,799
um

2035
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,279
what which one of this would apply to

2036
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,679
that company because usually remember

2037
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,679
some of these contracts are actually

2038
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,399
given to for example minorities

2039
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,080
uh minority owned companies

2040
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,080
or small businesses because it's a

2041
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,480
directive right of

2042
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,239
dod

2043
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,839
how would these people do

2044
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,000
well it's going to work is that you know

2045
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,760
as my understanding

2046
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,360
that i've been i've never even seen any

2047
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,199
these different contracts

2048
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,719
is going to say like you know if you

2049
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,719
want to bid on this contract

2050
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,239
you must be certified at cmm level what

2051
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,679
have you and it's going to be

2052
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,920
appropriate for that contract

2053
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,960
um

2054
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,800
and again my understanding from what

2055
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,600
they've talked about is that you know

2056
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,800
in many cases it's going to depend on

2057
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,239
the type of contracts you're going to go

2058
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,159
after you know if you're a company that

2059
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,159
that you know you do

2060
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,600
you know like

2061
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,719
clothing

2062
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,000
you know and

2063
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,440
you know boots and clothing and this

2064
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,800
sort of stuff

2065
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,400
you know

2066
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,239
all the content you would probably go

2067
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:49,280
after

2068
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,840
are probably going to be level one

2069
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,719
you know

2070
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,040
whereas if you're a contractor that

2071
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,120
you're going after

2072
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,719
you know missile guidance systems

2073
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,239
i'm gonna have to suspect that that's

2074
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,600
gonna require

2075
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,000
you know a four or five

2076
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,679
yeah

2077
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:08,880
and

2078
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
you know so it's gonna be you know this

2079
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
just you know all the time you know so

2080
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,719
basically depending on the type of

2081
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,400
you're you're the type of business or

2082
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,320
whatever contract you are

2083
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,280
you know

2084
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,320
all the contractors that are probably

2085
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,040
going to be the same level

2086
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,560
uh now one thing they've also talked

2087
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,239
about and i probably should have

2088
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,400
mentioned that um but i know it wasn't

2089
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,360
really clear how it is is apparently at

2090
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,280
least

2091
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,800
at the beginning

2092
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,760
they're

2093
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,360
they're going to take into consideration

2094
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,600
that you know companies

2095
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,520
you know contractors who are going and

2096
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,679
bidding are going to need to be

2097
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,679
at some level

2098
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,960
there's going to be a cost involved with

2099
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,760
that

2100
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,760
so apparently there'd be some kind of

2101
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,440
program in place at least at the

2102
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,640
beginning

2103
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,520
where

2104
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,800
you know

2105
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,480
you're going to get funding

2106
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,120
to help you achieve

2107
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,640
what you need

2108
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,360
yeah

2109
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,480
and that will probably be something that

2110
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,159
will it'll that'll exist for a while

2111
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,400
until not so it's like okay well yeah at

2112
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,159
this point everyone who needs to get it

2113
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,640
has it you know

2114
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,719
and it you know it's viewed as a cost of

2115
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,239
doing business

2116
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,040
yeah type thing

2117
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,320
i see

2118
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,159
okay so

2119
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,320
it looks like this this this stuff is

2120
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,760
pretty good and it's well

2121
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,920
well-intentioned but i'm not sure how

2122
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,880
this

2123
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,199
like for big companies is just

2124
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,679
for sure this should be applied but i i

2125
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,080
i have myself participated in some of

2126
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,360
these bits that i just told you about

2127
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,080
and

2128
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,080
uh what you end up doing is basically

2129
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,159
playing with the big guys

2130
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:45,360
maybe that's how you're able to get um

2131
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,640
and millions i would also look at it

2132
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,040
again if you look at the different 5-5

2133
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,400
levels it's like

2134
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,920
you know

2135
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,199
you know unless

2136
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,640
you know unless you're one of the ones

2137
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,280
where you know to me the big guys would

2138
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,040
be the ones that will be up that would

2139
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,320
need like the three four and five levels

2140
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,199
right

2141
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,040
and if you are a small company yeah that

2142
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,480
that could be difficult in term like you

2143
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,480
have to make sure that you get

2144
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,480
to that level as well

2145
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,400
but you kind of wonder you know again

2146
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,560
i'm not really as up on you know some of

2147
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,159
the federal countering as others but you

2148
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,480
know oftentimes they'll have

2149
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,400
you know special deals where like oh

2150
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,159
yeah we want to help out

2151
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,239
the small companies that will have you

2152
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,360
know like

2153
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,239
a grant or what have you so i could

2154
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,600
certainly see

2155
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,120
where they'll have like you know some

2156
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,679
special deals where okay you're a small

2157
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:34,960
company

2158
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,840
going out for federal bids you know

2159
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,640
you know that's going to cost you to get

2160
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,440
you know

2161
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,880
this level of whatever c on c level

2162
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,840
so they'll be they'll might make funding

2163
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,760
available

2164
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,600
and one thing's also just which i i'm

2165
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,560
not

2166
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,800
clear at this point um

2167
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,280
is not really clear what the cost of

2168
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,639
getting certified is

2169
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,120
i think that they want to make sure that

2170
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,800
it doesn't get

2171
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,840
um

2172
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,199
out of control

2173
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,560
you know

2174
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,159
they don't want these companies

2175
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,480
you know wanting to charge you know a

2176
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,600
hundred thousand you know for you to get

2177
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,760
you know turbine at level three where

2178
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,600
you got other companies were like

2179
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,520
well we can do that for fifty thousand

2180
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,320
or

2181
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,679
ten thousand

2182
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,840
you know

2183
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,239
so it's like freedom for like myself

2184
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,560
there's like like well what does it cost

2185
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,080
to like get a sock two report

2186
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,080
that i'm oblivious to that wasn't really

2187
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,159
involved in that or high trust i know

2188
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,719
there is costs involved but

2189
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,159
what this causes i don't know and then i

2190
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,600
sort of like wonder okay well if i were

2191
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,719
to go to

2192
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,920
you know a big firm versus a small firm

2193
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,440
you know

2194
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,120
is that a cause you know would that be a

2195
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,360
cost savings for me right

2196
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,480
i don't know

2197
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,360
right

2198
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,520
and that and that leads me through sorry

2199
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,159
another question i'm sort of uh

2200
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,080
going off here um

2201
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,640
that leads me to to the other question

2202
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,440
when you talk about kui right

2203
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,960
it seems to me that kui can be anything

2204
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,400
i if i develop certain things

2205
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
that a certain branch of the military

2206
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,600
uses

2207
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,800
i think

2208
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,440
that that may turn into koi

2209
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,400
that

2210
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,199
may not be disclosed publicly uh

2211
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,920
even stuff that

2212
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,600
may not be per se military or or used

2213
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,719
for

2214
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,800
for military purposes

2215
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,880
but that could provide eventually an

2216
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,800
adversary with hints

2217
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,800
of the usage of this on the military

2218
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,760
ventures

2219
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,760
yeah and that's why i mean it's even

2220
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,400
interesting that they have um i should

2221
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,440
have mentioned is there obviously

2222
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,400
training

2223
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,239
you need to go through

2224
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,080
to understand what kui and how to

2225
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,600
protect it

2226
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,199
um you know and that's something that

2227
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,120
was it was being rolled out

2228
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,640
by this that by the by the uh the

2229
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,000
creation board is it's actually coming

2230
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,640
from the dod if you go to their the the

2231
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,040
page you know the uh prediction board

2232
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,560
page is actually a link where you can go

2233
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,600
and get

2234
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,520
training on how to protect kui

2235
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,000
uh and so forth

2236
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,600
but yeah uh it is it is it is uh

2237
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,280
it is problematic in terms of making

2238
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,320
sure that you

2239
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,000
understand it but i think i think also

2240
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,480
for a lot of us i know for myself i mean

2241
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,840
i didn't even know what the heck that

2242
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,120
was you know

2243
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,719
that because my thinking has always been

2244
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,120
like oh you know you know if it's if it

2245
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,360
needs to be protected it's it's secret

2246
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,960
it's it's you know it's classified

2247
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,239
secret and

2248
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,960
and whatever is above secret

2249
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,800
but you know

2250
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,280
to find out that oh no there's this data

2251
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,520
that's below secret that you still have

2252
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,800
to protect

2253
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,560
you know and it's really serious and

2254
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,840
those are like

2255
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,040
really

2256
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,199
i mean

2257
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,640
i didn't think about that even though i

2258
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,920
wasn't thinking about but think about

2259
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,320
this you and actually all of us most of

2260
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,159
us here are in the industry we are

2261
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,760
certainly exposed to this let's say you

2262
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,360
create a model that detects something

2263
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,280
that an adversary has

2264
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,000
right that is either not commercial

2265
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
neither the government is aware of it

2266
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,840
neither the adversary knows that you're

2267
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,440
about to discover it as soon as you

2268
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,679
publish it you told them right

2269
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,880
yeah

2270
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,760
yeah it is you know i mean i mean i was

2271
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,960
somebody from motorola from all the

2272
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,960
different different you know security

2273
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,400
levels for our documents and so forth um

2274
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,760
but it's sort of like i didn't really

2275
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,280
connect the dots

2276
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,360
that that's the true that was also true

2277
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,040
in the

2278
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,719
the government space there was this you

2279
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,600
know data that was below secret but

2280
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,760
still had to be protected you know it

2281
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,239
was so sensitive and

2282
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,520
you know we didn't want our advertisers

2283
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,719
to get it and this sort of stuff and i

2284
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,840
was like

2285
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,480
oh okay i didn't know just i didn't

2286
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,080
didn't connect those dots but you know

2287
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,520
the importance of what we do

2288
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,080
that a lot of we kind of lose sight of

2289
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,400
you know

2290
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,400
and i think you know even people outside

2291
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,920
of our field certainly

2292
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,040
you know

2293
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,280
uh i've occasionally have mentioned

2294
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,120
you know the people outside of

2295
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,600
our field about you know what what what

2296
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,199
are atps and i don't know i don't mean

2297
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,120
atps and just sort of threats to me like

2298
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,679
there's there's these groups out there

2299
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:28,400
and

2300
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,480
they're trying to get our data and so on

2301
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,199
and so forth and i think that the

2302
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,360
average joe person

2303
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,880
is just

2304
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,719
totally oblivious to that sort of thing

2305
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,400
unless something comes like like the

2306
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,840
colonial pipeline and they're really

2307
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,800
like

2308
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,480
there's bad guys out there and they're

2309
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,320
like

2310
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,560
hit the hospital and

2311
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,280
someone died

2312
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,040
yeah

2313
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,960
okay oh

2314
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,960
well this was an amazing presentation

2315
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,600

yeah i mean put them together i mean

2329
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,080
the slides were actually

2330
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,679
you know the pictures actually pulled

2331
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,120
from

2332
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,640
various places and some of the sites

2333
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,560
were actually from the you know the

2334
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,280
document but if you know what's good is

2335
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,880
i wouldn't you know i would say i

2336
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,480
recommend people i mean there's actually

2337
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
a presentation they did

2338
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,360
um

2339
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,280
as part of the dmv stuff basically it

2340
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,719
was you know

2341
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,880
a presentation on the siemens c model i

2342
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,800
printed out as part of my little

2343
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
booklet here but just even the basic

2344

you know and so forth and there's like

2348
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,159
you know if you look at the impedance

2349
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,080
there's like a glossary and they explain

2350

some of the things and so forth um

2351

you know and it is kind of like and

2352
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,239
what's also nice is if you go to the uh

2353
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,639
the ab website they were they they were

2354
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,239
doing a lot of these presentation these

2355
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,120
town halls and so forth um yeah i was

2356
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,480
making the point of going and attending

2357
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,159
some of them and i was able to

2358
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,639
uh you know understand certain things in

2359
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,080
one objective and turn around and told

2360
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,480
my company i mean when the first thing i

2361
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,639
i picked up was

2362
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,159
hearing them you know talking about kui

2363
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:33,600
and i'm like

2364
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,199
what

2365
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,639
if this are like they kind of threw me

2366
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:38,880
off and they're like oh okay

2367
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,000
you know

2368
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,280
and i mean that's the way it is with

2369
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,000
that i guess the dod they they they more

2370
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,960
often pronounce the acronym so so it's

2371
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,719
this differs

2372
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,400
and kui and

2373
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,760
you know

2374
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,040
dib and all that sort of stuff and

2375
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,560
you just have to kind of get used to

2376
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,560
that sort of thing and then

2377
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,199
