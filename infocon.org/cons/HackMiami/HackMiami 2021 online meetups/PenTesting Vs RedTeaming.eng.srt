so penciling and red taping so i've

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,599
noticed over the time

162
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,120
that a lot of non-type folk don't really

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
understand the

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
the what's the difference between though

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
of the both pan testing and red teaming

166
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,039
um i mean sometimes even people with an

167
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
it don't really fully understand

168
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,840
they think it's the same thing so the

169
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,240
word

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
red team it gets tossed around a lot

171
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,520
it's

172
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
it's a very addicting buzzword

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
especially during

174
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
events such as defcon we have red team

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,840
village for example

176
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,319
the word red team it actually has two

177
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,520
meanings

178
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
so one of them is referring to the

179
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
overall red team

180
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
as in the offensive side of security

181
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
like the attacking side if you may

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,639
the red team actually comes from the

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
from the military when they're doing

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
actually their their training

185
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,639
um when they're doing the the offense

186
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,400
versus the defense

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
so the offense will be the red team and

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,879
the defense will be the blue team

189
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,240
so now the other meaning of red team is

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
actually referring to the red team

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,800
operators which is what i am are or red

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,840
teamers

193
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
so this is a team that actually not only

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
does pen testing

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
but also does physical and social

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,280
engineering

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,639
which is what marks the difference

198
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
between a red teamer and a predecessor

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,319
so we're going to be going a little bit

200
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,199
more in depth on that

201
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
so let's take a a step back so this is

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
an example

203
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
of a for just just a sample it's not

204
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
exactly like this

205
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
uh this is an internal red team crew

206
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,599
that might be part of a company

207
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000
as in their internal staff or for

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
example for their internal testing

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
you might have for example within the

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
red team you'll have the

211
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
the pen tester um you'll have offensive

212
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
tool developers you might have

213
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
exploit developers you might have

214
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,760
reverse engineers

215
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
sometimes however it's not often within

216
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,360
the same company you'll have a security

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
auditor for example

218
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,519
um other parts of the that do belong

219
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,560
inside of red teams

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
are uh hacker one and bug crown those

221
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,640
are actually uh

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,760
fantastic platforms will kind of

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
fantastic

224
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
a due to factor for example companies

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,839
would register

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
to platforms such as hacker one or blood

227
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
crab um

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,399
in order for pet testers to try to find

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:18,959
bug

230
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
within their software within their tools

231
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
within their services

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,839
report them and get a bounty for that

233
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,320
so now you also have the blue teams in

234
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
the blue teams you have the cso you have

235
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
cloud security architects you have the

236
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
i.t security analysts

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
uh digital forensics incident response

238
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
you have

239
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
information security managers you have

240
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,240
stock analysts so that's a holistic view

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,560
of

242
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
what a red team and a blue team might be

243
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
you also have the purple teams

244
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
which is a mixture of the red teams and

245
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
the blue teams

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
now this that we see here is one

247
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,399
definition of a red team

248
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
so anything that is within the

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,839
offensive side of security can be

250
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,480
considered

251
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
a team are these red teamers well no not

252
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,320
exactly

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
we'll go more into that now

254
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,880
so within the overall

255
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
um holistic view you have the red team

256
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
which is the offensive side and then you

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,600
have the blue team

258
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
which is the defense so within the red

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
team you have the red team

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,240
and the pan testers so the pentaxers

261
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,440
focus on attacking mostly software

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
anything that they can access through

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
the internet or offline if they're

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
actually at the location they're

265
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
actually testing

266
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,880
now a red teamer not only does what

267
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,920
apprentices does

268
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
but also takes the approach of adding

269
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:40,959
the

270
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,519
physical security and also social

271
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,000
engineering which is the human element

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
i mean if you think about it at the end

273
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
of the day humans we are usually the

274
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
weakest link that's

275
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,000
usually how everything is hacked at the

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
end of the day if we do an analysis on

277
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
that

278
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,200
so what exactly is is a pen tester so a

279
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
penetrative tester is a person

280
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
who with the use of automated and manual

281
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
tools tests for any possible

282
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,480
vulnerabilities or attempt to gain

283
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
unauthorized access to a system

284
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
i mean this is legally of course um

285
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,760
don't go around doing pad testing

286
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
without any any sort of authorization

287
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
so in essence pentesting is the practice

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
of of

289
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
targeting a system or external or

290
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
internal networks

291
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
um it could be web applications host

292
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,440
computers

293
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
servers even mobile applications in

294
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
order to attempt to find any possible

295
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,399
vulnerability that a malicious attacker

296
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,279
could exploit and take advantage of

297
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,320
now these pentas engagements are

298
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
commonly performed

299
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,959
for either compliance or possible

300
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,560
release of a new asset

301
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
on a company for example if they're

302
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,640
launching a new apple web application

303
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,959
or a new server um most of the time

304
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
within the years of experience doing pen

305
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,160
testing

306
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
it's not really a focus of trying to

307
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,519
increase security

308
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,839
most of the time is it's actually on a

309
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,279
release of a product or to

310
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,399
to to be either compliance or that sort

311
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,040
of

312
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
down that line so um pencils are usually

313
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
performed within a very constrained

314
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,279
scope

315
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,600
um on what is to be targeted and also

316
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
are currently performing the very

317
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
limited time frame for example within a

318
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,720
pen test you might see that the

319
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
engagement might last

320
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,000
anywhere from three days up to a week

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
maybe two weeks at most it all depends

322
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
really on the scope of the client and

323
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
what exactly you're going to be

324
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
targeting

325
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
so pen testers there's pentesters and

326
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,959
nowadays

327
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
pretty much everywhere any hacker is a

328
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,320
fan tester

329
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,279
um for example if if you search online

330
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,079
on

331
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,120
on platforms such as try hack me or hack

332
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
the box

333
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,440
you're literally gonna find thousands of

334
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,399
packers that are

335
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,839
attempting to exploit things every day

336
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
and they're practicing every day

337
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
um if you fight for people looking out

338
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
and reaching out to for example

339
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,399
the cyber mentor or people at defcon or

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,839
the red team villages you're gonna find

341
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,959
contests

342
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,360
literally all over the place however red

343
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,000
teamers

344
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
i don't believe there is that many out

345
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,560
there personally i i know a few that i'm

346
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,920
actually going to be mentioning within a

347
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
presentation

348
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
um but there aren't that much red

349
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
teamers as much as they are

350
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
testers

351
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,320
so some people wonder if

352
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,079
a red team is actually a group of

353
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,600
panthers

354
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
no not exactly so a red team

355
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,959
or red team operator is a team of

356
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,399
trained specialists

357
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
with the proper ingredients to pull off

358
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
the impossible pretty much to get the

359
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
crown jewels get whatever it is the

360
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,519
company is trying to protect within

361
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,720
their assets

362
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
so the team must be able to overcome a

363
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
challenges navigate through difficult

364
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
situations work together when needed to

365
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
make the impossible possible

366
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,199
so what this means is that each member

367
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,120
should have a unique and complementary

368
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,839
skill

369
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
meaning that each member can project can

370
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
function

371
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
as a subject matter of an expert on his

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,320
or her own

373
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
and combine the individual expertise

374
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
with the collective knowledge of the

375
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:12,800
team

376
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
to pull off the the the equivalent of a

377
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,639
real prayer

378
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,399
or an adversary so to give a

379
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
an example i don't know if some of you

380
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
have actually watched this movie

381
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,600
maybe you have maybe you haven't i'm not

382
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
going to spoil it for you

383
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,160
so ocean's 12 where you actually have

384
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
george clooney and you have a couple of

385
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
other people as well

386
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
it's it's a it's a movie that deals

387
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,839
about a heist where you actually have a

388
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,839
team

389
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,360
so it's it's a team of con artists which

390
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
uh some of our current artists are

391
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
actually thieves

392
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,079
and each were though with their own

393
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
unique skills so you have the guy that

394
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
hacks into the cameras

395
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
also intercepts the intercepts of calls

396
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
whenever the the

397
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
business is actually calling the the

398
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
cops hey we have a threat in here

399
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
um there are team members who actually

400
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
dress up in order to

401
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,519
to blend in and perform specific tasks

402
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,160
so those would be social engineering

403
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
and of course the overall heist is

404
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,279
overcoming all the security measures

405
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
that they have in place so if you ask me

406
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,519
if

407
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,079
this kind of is like red teaming in a

408
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,440
way not exactly but

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
in a way now within the movie

410
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
uh you also have the one another bad guy

411
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
which is called the night box which is

412
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
another current artisan thief however he

413
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
works solo

414
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,959
not in a team so in a way he's not

415
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,240
really a red team

416
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,560
i would consider it more of a solo

417
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,439
panther in a way

418
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,800
so what makes the difference between

419
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
pen testing and red teaming so the three

420
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
key elements

421
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
of there is a hidden fourth uh

422
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
the three key elements that separates

423
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
the red team between a pan tester

424
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,759
is the aspect of cyber which is

425
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,839
hacking for example endpoints servers

426
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,440
networks web apps anything

427
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,839
that you can hack into or get into from

428
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,040
behind a computer

429
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,320
remotely from the internet so

430
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,240
nothing that requires your physical

431
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
presence

432
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
so what other things actually make a

433
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
rectum return would be the physical

434
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,959
aspects

435
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,680
such as being able to bypass or hack

436
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
security cameras

437
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
alarms locks doors gates fences

438
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
anything that would require your

439
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,399
physical presence

440
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,199
that's done by a red teamer not a pen

441
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,480
tester

442
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,440
and finally the third element which is

443
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,759
the

444
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,839
the human aspect would be social

445
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,120
engineering

446
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
this could be for example social

447
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
engineering the the employees

448
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
could be fishing could be vision and

449
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
even social engineering third parties

450
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,720
related to their employees

451
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
such as family members such as a social

452
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,519
engineering or fishing

453
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
a company that supplies product to the

454
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
main organization that you're trying to

455
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,800
to to attack so all of these would

456
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,839
compromise

457
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
that what would uh would be part

458
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
of a red teamer so um

459
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,359
the other key element that i actually

460
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,640
didn't mention here

461
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
is uh another difference between the

462
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,799
protesters and the red teamers

463
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
is that contestants when they're hired

464
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
for the engagement

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
um they do their reconnaissance they do

466
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
their hacking they do the expectation

467
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,959
they do the report

468
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,520
and they provide the report now a red

469
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,799
teamer

470
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
does similar as in does the

471
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
reconnaissance does the exploitation

472
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
gains access does a report but the

473
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
difference between apprentice and a red

474
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
teamer is that a red teamer usually

475
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,760
would

476
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
also after providing the report will

477
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,039
work hand-in-hand

478
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,080
with their internal operation team to

479
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
actually fix whatever it was found

480
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
it wouldn't just like oh here's a report

481
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,520
okay bye-bye you're done fix it no it

482
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
doesn't work that way

483
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
so a red team would actually stay behind

484
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,320
and actually help the company to improve

485
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,280
their security

486
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
on whatever it is that they found how

487
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,280
they could fix it what are the possible

488
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,399
solutions and whatnot

489
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
um so a little bit on on

490
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,679
past testing certifications i pulled off

491
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,160
this

492
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
pretty nice chart uh from this website

493
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
paul jeremy.com

494
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
um there's a lot of certifications there

495
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,960
depending on on the on the route that

496
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
you're taking for example security and

497
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,280
risk management

498
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
or if you're going through network

499
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
security or if you're going to pen

500
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,799
testing

501
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,000
i mean like there's a lot of

502
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,760
certifications there some of them i

503
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,640
haven't even

504
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
heard of in my life um some common

505
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,320
well-known shirts for for pen testing

506
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,000
are ceh you got the pentes plus the oscp

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,559
osep uh the g-pan the lpt

508
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,440
now all of these are for princesses

509
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
they're commonly required for example if

510
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
you look if you're applying to a job and

511
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
hr is requiring certifications for you

512
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,840
to be a fantastic with them

513
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,799
chances are they're going to be

514
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,640
requiring at least one one or two of

515
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
these

516
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
now if you consider certifications for

517
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
pen testing versus certifications for

518
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,120
red team operators um to be honest

519
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,760
there's

520
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
barely any if any at all um i did find

521
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,919
that uh there is a certification for a

522
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
red team operator from red team alliance

523
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
i left the link below

524
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
on the presentation um you can actually

525
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
check it out uh they

526
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
actually have a course on teach you all

527
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,200
aspects of physical security and

528
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,919
red team operating and uh once you

529
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,880
complete the course and pass the

530
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,520
certificate

531
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,799
the exam they can actually provide you

532
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
with the certification so that's

533
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,200
pretty much the only one that i've seen

534
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,880
most red teamers out there that i'm

535
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
aware of don't really have

536
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,919
a red team operator certification

537
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,440
because it has to do with physical

538
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
security and social engineering

539
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
if you think about it for social

540
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
engineering deceiving people lying to

541
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
people

542
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
getting your way physically into acting

543
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
to places where you're not supposed to

544
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,000
be

545
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,440
there isn't really an institution that

546
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,320
trains you how to do that and uh

547
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
even more there's not going to be a

548
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,760
certification on that kind of things

549
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,559
so moving on to the scope the scope

550
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,360
between time testing and red teaming so

551
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
for example

552
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
here on the left we can see the common

553
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,480
scope for a contester

554
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
we can see the external network which

555
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,679
could

556
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,360
could be either a url it could be

557
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
external ips could be in a complete

558
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
range it all depends on what the clients

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
have for for the external network

560
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,919
um it could be their internal network

561
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,159
could be servers inside of the network

562
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,120
it could be internal web applications um

563
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,679
could be mobile applications

564
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,760
it could be cloud as well for example

565
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
hey if they're using azure or aws

566
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,280
it all depends on the client and whatnot

567
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,840
um

568
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
i did include fishing in the pan testing

569
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,919
um as a as a

570
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,240
thing that protesters commonly do it's

571
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,360
not that common

572
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,760
i would honestly think that it's if you

573
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
want an effective fishing campaign it

574
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,159
would be

575
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,559
towards more of a red teaming because of

576
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,480
the time that it usually takes

577
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,159
and iot so a little bit more on that

578
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,200
phishing

579
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,760
um i did put it on the testing for

580
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,039
example if you have a client

581
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,640
or a customer that asks you hey can you

582
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
do a phishing campaign if you want to

583
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
set up a phishing server

584
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
um you can literally do it within a

585
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,919
couple of hours so you just have to

586
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,960
to get a vps such as

587
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,000
one on digital ocean or aws

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and uh within a couple of hours you can

589
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
have a phishing server

590
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,720
but here's the thing within fishing if

591
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,159
you're doing it as a pen testing

592
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,600
chances are because of the scope that

593
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
you have which is usually just a couple

594
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,919
of days

595
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,840
versus a red team which might have a

596
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,080
couple of weeks or even months

597
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
um chances are when you create the

598
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,120
phishing server

599
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
it's going to land in the in the in the

600
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,159
spam folder

601
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
like immediately because when you're

602
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,960
rent teaming if you're doing phishing

603
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
properly how you want to

604
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,919
um you're going to be doing a phishing

605
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,520
server you're going to be purchasing the

606
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,080
domain

607
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
you're going to be setting up spf dtim

608
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
dkim you're going to be setting up your

609
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
dmarc records

610
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,280
and then you're going to propagate and

611
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
use the email accounts for that server

612
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,440
to be sending emails back and forth for

613
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,200
at least a couple of weeks

614
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,120
just so that there's actually activity

615
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
and it doesn't land on the spam filters

616
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
so that's why i think it's not really a

617
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
contest anything and that's why i

618
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,840
consider fishing

619
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,880
as strategic and ideal fishing would be

620
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,159
performed by red teamer

621
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,240
not a pet tester so now red teaming

622
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,120
so red teaming is everything that we see

623
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,960
on the pen testing side

624
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,240
but also including the red tv aspects

625
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,919
such as the human element which is

626
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
social engineering

627
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
you have oceans which you're doing it

628
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
not only to the company you're attacking

629
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
but also into the supply chain or even

630
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
third parties for example

631
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,360
um you might be doing uh social

632
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,400
engineering into

633
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440
uh family members of a ceo or

634
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,640
into uh all sent into

635
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,320
a company that supplies bathroom

636
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,679
products for the building that you're

637
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,360
trying to get into so

638
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
all that is part of red tv not pen

639
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,799
testing

640
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,280
you also have vision you also have

641
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,320
wireless

642
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
wi-fi attacks uh which that would

643
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
require your physical presence that's

644
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
not something you can do

645
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,880
from another country um you have r8d and

646
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,760
access control

647
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
which also would require your physical

648
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,120
presence

649
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
um you also have lock picking lock

650
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
bypassing as well

651
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,559
and you also have physical implants and

652
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,720
attacks such as using for example

653
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,559
uh the usb rubber directory from hack

654
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,600
five or the or using a usb esp32 if you

655
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,039
create it yourself

656
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
um you also have uh keyloggers as well

657
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,520
that you can actually

658
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,720
implant so yeah

659
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
the physical implants that will be part

660
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,640
of red to me not pen testing

661
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,760
so rules of engagement so usually as a

662
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,559
fan tester

663
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,039
um you have rules of things that you're

664
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,720
allowed and you're not allowed to do one

665
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
of the most common ones is you're not

666
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,520
allowed to do a ddrs

667
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,320
a ddos um you might have for example

668
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,880
specific

669
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,799
specific ips to target not always

670
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
everything on the network like let's say

671
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
um your client might have a network uh

672
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
separated network

673
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
internally that they might have the

674
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
servers on on one subnet they might have

675
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,679
host another subnet

676
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
and they might ask you to only tackle

677
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
the attack servers not the end points

678
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,080
that's

679
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,200
one example it could be specific urls

680
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
for example they might have a web

681
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,400
application that is

682
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
in production but they may have another

683
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
which is a demo they might ask you to

684
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
add to attack the demo

685
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
and not the one in production um also

686
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
another

687
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,400
thing in rules of engagements for

688
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,200
example uh uh a pen testing versus red

689
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
teaming is that in pen testing usually

690
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
if you're doing an internal contest uh

691
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,559
chances are they're actually the client

692
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,840
is actually gonna provide you with

693
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,600
credentials for a vpn

694
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
a vpn access so you can actually do the

695
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
contest for the internal site

696
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
um a red teamer will actually have to

697
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,279
spend the time into

698
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,480
fishing trying to collect um

699
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,720
the credentials in order to gain access

700
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
to the network and then from their pivot

701
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
on

702
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,240
um as i mentioned a vpn connection is

703
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,440
usually provided for

704
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
internal testing um another thing that

705
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,799
you'll see

706
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,720
commonly is that for example they might

707
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,919
say okay uh

708
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,279
since during the day we're working we

709
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,880
only want you to attack our internal

710
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
network or external network

711
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,600
between 6 p.m and 3 a.m um it can be

712
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,320
only done

713
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,799
over the weekends or it can't be done on

714
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
the 15th of each month because we push

715
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,520
updates

716
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,279
it can be different reasons it all

717
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,919
varies depending on the client

718
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,320
and uh also within pen testing versus

719
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
red teaming

720
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,520
since you have a very limited time for

721
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
engagement um

722
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,120
not always you're going to achieve a

723
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,880
compromise target

724
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
um it all varies depending on what scope

725
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,279
and what are the constraints and

726
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,480
what's the limitations that you have

727
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
with the engagement

728
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,080
so if you ask me which one is is better

729
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
between the red teaming and fantastic i

730
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,720
would

731
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,559
i would definitely say that red teaming

732
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
is a more

733
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
uh besides a more physical approach it's

734
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,400
more hands-on and so it's

735
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,279
more of a real threat case scenario

736
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,480
versus a fantastic

737
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
because in the fantasy you have so many

738
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,440
constraints and so many things you have

739
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
to bypass

740
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,320
within the physical or renting

741
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,360
you have to think outside the box

742
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,080
you have to think of things that

743
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,640
normally

744
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
are not the the common way of practicing

745
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,240
an engagement in an attacking scenario

746
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,720
for example you'll have an enterprise

747
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,520
that have

748
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,880
so many security measures implemented

749
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,320
on their company that it makes it

750
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
pretty hard to actually get involved

751
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
physically you can actually bypass a

752
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,840
couple blocks and actually get in

753
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,240
and and physically walk out with their

754
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
server like

755
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,919
i've had engagement that i can that i

756
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:52,799
could have like

757
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,279
easily just go into a little bit like

758
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,279
okay a quick

759
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,919
story here so one time i actually had a

760
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,600
physical engagement

761
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,480
where the the client they actually even

762
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,279
had

763
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,400
um a port monitoring

764
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,559
and uh implemented like they had so many

765
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,679
security and

766
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
things in place and it was it ridiculous

767
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,679
but to answer that they actually had two

768
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,440
different locations one was in a main

769
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,039
facility where they even had an alarms

770
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,000
and whatnot

771
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,520
and they had another facility which is

772
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,120
what's in a shared office space and

773
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,880
wasn't that really secure

774
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,799
and we were able to me and my team were

775
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,039
able to gain access into the building

776
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
and uh pop open a couple of doors and we

777
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
literally had access to

778
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,520
to everything in that building so

779
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,159
sometimes

780
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,799
not everything that you do in cyber as

781
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
in controls and security stuff

782
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
can guarantee that you're 100 safe so

783
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
you also have to consider

784
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
the physical aspect of things

785
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,960
so here's a sample pentas methodology

786
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,799
it's not exactly like this i just

787
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,039
made it up well not made it over but you

788
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,840
have an idea

789
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,200
so you have reconnaissance you have

790
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,440
enumeration you have exploitation

791
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
probe escalation lateral movement you

792
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,960
have pawn and reporting

793
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
so here's the thing

794
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
what happens even with the

795
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,159
reconnaissance phase

796
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,440
you're doing your port scan your

797
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,679
reconnaissance um into the

798
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,880
the external ip of a company it

799
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
turns out that they have no external

800
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,440
facing web applications

801
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,000
they have only one public ip which is

802
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,720
actually for

803
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,039
internal use and there's literally

804
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,799
nothing running on it

805
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,440
so you pretty much have a block in this

806
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,559
spot right here

807
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,360
so after here if you're fantastic what

808
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,240
are you gonna do

809
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,559
you're gonna find anything so that's it

810
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,919
you're stuck there you're not gonna be

811
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,360
able to hide the company

812
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,679
well actually no that's what makes the

813
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,120
difference between a protester and a red

814
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,600
tamer

815
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,960
the red timer would actually think

816
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,039
outside the box would do reconnaissance

817
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,000
on the company

818
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,880
we would see actually who are the

819
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
employees would try to

820
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,320
target people related to the employees

821
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,039
could be

822
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,880
family members could be friends it could

823
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,399
be many different things

824
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,039
you could actually do reconnaissance on

825
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,960
the building where the facility is

826
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,279
you know check google maps see what the

827
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,880
building looks like or actually go on

828
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,600
site

829
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,640
see how's their physical security and

830
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,360
another thing to consider is that

831
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
um pen testing versus red teaming

832
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
processing yeah you can do pretty much

833
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,159
anywhere from any part of the world all

834
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
you need is

835
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,880
a computer and internet for red teaming

836
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
uh you actually have to have

837
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
physical access to at least one of the

838
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,919
uh resource

839
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
locations of the of the company that

840
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,640
you're actually trying to target

841
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,720
so um as i mentioned fantasy can be

842
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
performed from any location it doesn't

843
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,480
require physical presence but red

844
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
teaming does require travel

845
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,120
as uh as physical and social engineering

846
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,200
does require a physical presence

847
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,440
um so in fantasy

848
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
you could be doing a pen testing any

849
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,559
company

850
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,840
which can vary from a mom and pop shop

851
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,799
all the way to a big fortune 500 company

852
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,559
it all varies

853
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,320
now for the red team engagements usually

854
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,240
you're not going to be doing those to

855
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
small businesses that's usually

856
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
focused to bigger companies um

857
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
in my opinion red teami is it has a

858
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,880
large

859
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,320
focus on the industrial stuff

860
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
like for example you'll have power

861
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
plants you'll have miracle plants you

862
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
have water refineries you have

863
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,480
gas plants anything that has to do with

864
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,600
the iot

865
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,880
could be a scada it could be ics

866
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
industrial control systems

867
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,799
anything in within this aspect of these

868
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,760
companies

869
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,080
um would you be usually targeted by a

870
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
red team operator because

871
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,600
what a red team operator is is trying to

872
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,919
emulate as much as possible a real

873
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,880
threat

874
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,880
scenario so um all these sample picks

875
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,440
are from the

876
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,760
industrial facilities which all of these

877
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
are actually all over the world

878
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
and a lot of them in remote and

879
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
unsecured locations

880
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,399
since companies think that nobody would

881
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,919
go there um

882
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,320
for example you'll find one of these in

883
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
the middle of nowhere with

884
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
maybe one or two employees that might

885
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,120
rotate

886
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
heck i mean some of these don't even

887
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,799
have a staff on site you just

888
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,440
drive by and physical engage physical

889
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,159
passes your way in

890
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
so a real attacker wouldn't try to go

891
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,600
through the main gates of the company

892
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,519
where the security is the highest

893
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,519
for example if they have a main office

894
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,039
and their headquarters is actually in

895
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,000
new york

896
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
but they have small branches and all

897
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,760
over the world

898
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
you're not going to go to the main

899
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,720
building in new york no you're going to

900
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
find the smallest one

901
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,360
where their security is is the the least

902
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
hardest and try to get your your access

903
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,720
through there

904
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,960
so an attacker would pick the least

905
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,360
secure remote location

906
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,360
so what's scary about the iot scada

907
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,039
and gesture control things is that

908
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,760
if you actually look closely into iot

909
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,120
search engines

910
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,000
um i'm not going to mention though but

911
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
the search engines out there you

912
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,000
actually know

913
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,840
and you know what you're looking for i'm

914
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,279
sure you're going to be able to

915
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,799
to see panels and act and screens like

916
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,960
this that some of these devices

917
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,600
which is scary enough such as uh well

918
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,440
for example colonial systems

919
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,440
um they had remotely accessible things

920
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,240
so it happens it really happens and

921
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,360
these are the things that actually

922
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,840
should be

923
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,519
looking into and taken care of

924
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,720
um so here is a common skill set and

925
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,919
tools required for

926
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,000
for each of the different aspects so you

927
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,600
got cyber you got physical and you

928
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,799
got social uh for cyber

929
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,440
or patent testing um you have to have

930
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,279
really good knowledge on networking

931
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,880
um on the protocols such as ftp http you

932
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,039
got to know your protocols very well

933
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,519
um you gotta know where locations you

934
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,720
gotta know the

935
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,360
commonly uh tools and platforms that are

936
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,719
used for web applications

937
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,720
you gotta know about databases mysql

938
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
you gotta know about programming uh

939
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,760
personally i know

940
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
um one of the strongest ones that i know

941
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,720
is python i'm again i'm not a developer

942
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
but you still have to have at least some

943
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,559
sort of a level understanding

944
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,760
that you can actually even though you

945
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,679
don't know how to code in something but

946
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,799
once you read it you're

947
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,200
able to determine what exactly is doing

948
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,480
because god forbid for example you're

949
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,240
trying to do a panthers engagement

950
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
you download a tool from github and

951
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
turns out you have no idea what it's

952
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,200
doing and you think you're using it for

953
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
one thing next thing you know

954
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,480
an attacker actually compromised your

955
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,919
machine

956
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,080
um you got to know different cloud

957
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
architectures

958
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,679
aws azure um containers

959
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,960
not really a little bit of dockers

960
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
um you gotta know very well about

961
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
command control servers

962
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,720
um there's a lot of them out there a

963
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
couple of a couple of them

964
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
actually enterprise a coupe a lot of

965
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,120
them are free

966
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,000
um you gotta know about fishing uh what

967
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,519
are the common things done by

968
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,159
my pentesters due to the limited time

969
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,280
constraint that you have when doing an

970
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,560
engagement you got to know about

971
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
vulnerability scanning

972
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,000
exploiting if you find something that

973
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,599
you can actually attack

974
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,639
active directory that's a must

975
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,399
and uh different kinds of servers if you

976
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,760
have a file server if you have a

977
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,560
database server and why not

978
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,119
so now for the physical aspect you got

979
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,719
to know about lock picking you got to

980
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,800
know about lock bypassing

981
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,639
uh the the differences between a pin

982
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
tumbler and a wafer lock

983
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,359
tubular locks um you got to know about

984
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,119
elevator keys there's actually different

985
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,280
kinds of brands of elevators

986
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,239
um if you search online you can actually

987
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,320
find the default keys for the elevators

988
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,520
which is pretty cool

989
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,879
if you're trying to do a physical

990
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,719
engagement let's say you walk into a

991
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,159
building that you're trying to do a

992
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
physical engagement

993
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
and uh turns out that the floor that

994
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,119
you're trying to to reach

995
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,760
has an rfid control and you don't have

996
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,520
an rfid to actually get in

997
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,680
but if you have the elevator key for the

998
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,440
elevator you just pop it open

999
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
and override the controls and just get

1000
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,079
to wherever you're actually trying to go

1001
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,920
um you have the alarms and cameras you

1002
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,200
gotta be uh

1003
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
gotta know how to how to actually bypass

1004
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
them or hack them

1005
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
um you have rfid and access controls

1006
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
which is pretty cool if you actually

1007
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
have a prox mark

1008
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,520
um you have the wireless attacks such as

1009
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
when you're using for example the wi-fi

1010
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,839
pineapple you can compromise the

1011
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,680
the building the the wi-fi from the

1012
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,200
building or the company if you're

1013
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,079
even without actually having to step a

1014
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,320
foot inside of the premises

1015
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
um you have the implant devices

1016
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,760
such as the esp key you got the rubber

1017
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
ducky you got the

1018
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,599
hack five the key croc which is pretty

1019
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,240
cool um you have uh

1020
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
building entry points you want to do a

1021
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,520
lot of reconnaissance into the building

1022
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
that you're actually trying to get into

1023
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,359
you want to survey the site you want to

1024
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,400
see if there's

1025
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,079
cameras that have dead zones um

1026
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,599
you want to see if they have fire

1027
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,200
escapes try to go through those

1028
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,960
fire escapes not the main i mean

1029
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
entrance um

1030
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,760
you might want to also find out about

1031
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,119
the landlord of the building

1032
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,839
if the building has people on staff

1033
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,960
during maintenance

1034
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,839
that they might be working overnight and

1035
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,880
um

1036
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,320
one thing commonly you'll see is also

1037
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
shared office spaces those are actually

1038
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,720
a lot easier to

1039
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
to get into than the if the company owns

1040
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,200
the mail building

1041
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,400
so for the social aspect you gotta

1042
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,720
be very very very well built well-versed

1043
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,760
in your oceans

1044
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,240
and your reconnaissance online on on

1045
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,000
anything regarding the company

1046
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
uh being able to do a third-party supply

1047
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,839
chain osen as well

1048
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,160
as in any provider of the of the company

1049
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,880
as well

1050
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,480
um once i've had an engagement that i

1051
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,079
actually had to the reconnaissance

1052
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,760
on who was the the msp of that company

1053
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,119
um you gotta learn about body language

1054
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
um wardrobing you gotta address

1055
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,440
accordingly depending on the area that

1056
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,359
you're actually trying to get into

1057
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,760
for example if you want to get into a

1058
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,359
building where they usually wear a suit

1059
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,040
inside what not you're not going to be

1060
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
wearing a t-shirt and shorts for example

1061
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,359
if a security guard

1062
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,280
walks by and sees you in a suit and tie

1063
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,720
trying to get into a building

1064
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,240
you can come up with an excuse oh yeah

1065
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,680
i'm sorry i apologize i'm trying to get

1066
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,440
in i just lost my key i'm an employee

1067
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,000
here

1068
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,079
and make up a good pretext and you might

1069
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,079
be able to get in

1070
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,240
um you're gonna have a vision skills

1071
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,839
we're actually doing phishing over the

1072
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,560
phone

1073
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,440
uh surveillance skills um if you

1074
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,800
actually pay attention to a lot of

1075
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
things there's a

1076
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,839
lot of things that can actually help you

1077
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,240
to gain more insight into the company

1078
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,839
and the employees

1079
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,960
uh photography you gotta be i mean you

1080
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
got to know how to take pictures

1081
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,119
for your reporting and and and uh also

1082
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,200
for your own reconnaissance as well

1083
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,359
empathy with the with the employees you

1084
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,480
gotta

1085
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,400
find a way to communicate with them to

1086
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,079
relate with them

1087
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,599
another thing with social is that you

1088
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,440
have you have to have a fake online

1089
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
personas

1090
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
fake illnesses because just in case you

1091
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,079
never know when someone might be looking

1092
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,640
you up

1093
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,920
with the name that you're that you're

1094
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
making up so you want to have that

1095
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,480
created just in case

1096
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,920
they try to find it also uh another

1097
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,359
thing that can help with fake online

1098
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,720
personas is that for example if you have

1099
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,599
an alias

1100
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,000
you're trying to target a company one

1101
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,960
way to gain

1102
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,400
access for example um you could create

1103
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,119
uh

1104
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,119
you could search for the company into

1105
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,880
their human resources department

1106
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
you would see that they're hiring for

1107
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,000
whatever position

1108
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
so you create a fake online persona with

1109
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,000
uh job requirements that would fulfill

1110
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,680
with the skills that would fill the job

1111
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,960
requirements that they have

1112
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
so even though you might or might not

1113
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,359
land an opportunity with uh with having

1114
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,560
an interview with hr

1115
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
but if you do for example chances are

1116
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,520
they're going to bring you into the

1117
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,000
building

1118
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,599
you can have a walk around see what

1119
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,440
actually looks on the inside

1120
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,800
it helps to with the engagement and then

1121
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,119
one important skill is of course with

1122
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,880
this actually applies for all of them

1123
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,320
is report writing you got to be able to

1124
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,920
write a good report with

1125
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,079
specifically all your findings how you

1126
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,160
find it uh how you can replicate what

1127
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,800
you found

1128
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,320
and how to mitigate whatever you found

1129
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,079
so within um physical tools

1130
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,800
you'll have this is a fun subject for me

1131
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,720
i have so many tools i mean i have well

1132
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,200
over

1133
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,040
10 different kinds of lockpicks and

1134
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
locks laying all around all over the

1135
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,760
place

1136
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,839
um so you have on the top left we see

1137
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,520
here the prox mark which is for

1138
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,599
cloning rfid badges that's a pretty cool

1139
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,440
device um a lot of people

1140
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,760
say oh yeah it's not worth it to the

1141
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,720
fact that you have to be

1142
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,079
within a couple of centimeters of the

1143
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,560
person well think about it this way

1144
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,079
let's say it's a it's a friday at noon

1145
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,960
it's a payday

1146
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,359
so everybody you know has money whatever

1147
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,400
everybody's hungry

1148
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,839
and you go to one of these supermarkets

1149
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,280
for example though i think i believe

1150
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,480
it's the bravo that

1151
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,000
have like a food court and you got

1152
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
people going through these

1153
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,839
areas when they're serving food and

1154
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,440
whatever

1155
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,359
you'll literally see them packed all

1156
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,640
over each other and you know they

1157
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,240
usually have badge on the side or the

1158
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,720
front

1159
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,560
all you have to do is just walk up to

1160
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,160
them really close or just pay attention

1161
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,800
to their food

1162
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,000
and just close the patch it literally

1163
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
takes a couple of seconds even less than

1164
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,960
that

1165
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,280
um so you have the usb implants for

1166
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,119
example the usb rubber ducky which is

1167
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,480
pretty cool it's a

1168
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
a tool that you plug it into the usb and

1169
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,000
it'll run a script

1170
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,839
um you also have the wi-fi pan apple

1171
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,599
which is for pen testing and doing

1172
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,680
wireless security audits

1173
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,640
um you have your lock picking tools you

1174
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,520
have the

1175
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,680
esp which is pretty cool device for

1176
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,040
for uh rfid so another approach is that

1177
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,880
instead of actually cloning the rfid

1178
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,440
badge

1179
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,839
you take this little device which is the

1180
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,960
side of a postcard

1181
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,000
and implant it on the the reader of the

1182
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,200
rfid badge

1183
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,599
on the on the building and just leave it

1184
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,319
there and

1185
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,079
follow up a day later and you can

1186
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,520
actually pull off all the other

1187
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
credentials that are actually scanned

1188
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,800
you can replicate those credentials and

1189
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,480
just gain access to the building you're

1190
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,560
going into

1191
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,079
um you can also use um in buildings to

1192
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,640
have

1193
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,720
rfid sensors and and proxmox and whatnot

1194
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,520
to get in

1195
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,280
usually they have a sensor for you to

1196
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
exit the building which can also be

1197
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,000
bypassed with

1198
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,119
uh with a can of compressed air

1199
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,680
um those sensors it would usually detect

1200
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,960
whenever there's a

1201
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,640
change of temperature in the sensor

1202
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,240
approaching the door so it will actually

1203
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
unlock the door

1204
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,800
um i have a video which i'm not able to

1205
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
show here publicly but if you ask me i

1206
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,000
can show it to you on how actually you

1207
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,520
can bypass these

1208
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,200
um you have slim gyms you have

1209
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,839
the under the door tools um which here

1210
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,640
is a demonstration

1211
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,839
how you actually drop it under the door

1212
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,680
and pull on the handle and then you can

1213
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
open the door

1214
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,000
um here i've added a couple of links on

1215
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
where you can actually purchase a lot of

1216
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,560
these tools

1217
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,599
i'm just not a sponsor paid sponsorship

1218
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,720
or anything

1219
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,280
personally i've spent my personal money

1220
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
into all of these tools

1221
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,560
um and uh besides the actual tools is

1222
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,240
actually the the techniques

1223
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,440
as well um on the left hand side

1224
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,160
there's a couple links for uh the

1225
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,240
channels for the lock-picking lawyer

1226
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,440
which uh he actually has a lot of

1227
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,359
videos on lock picking opening locks and

1228
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,280
different kinds of locks and how you can

1229
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,960
attack and approach each uh

1230
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
olaf which is a well-known red team

1231
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,079
operator and speaker that khan he's well

1232
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,599
known in the industry

1233
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,359
um another youtube channel for lock

1234
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,960
picking is bossy and bill

1235
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,480
and then finally you have the not so

1236
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,000
civil engineer those are all that i

1237
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,640
strongly recommend looking into because

1238
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,000
you can actually definitely learn from

1239
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
them

1240
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,040
um you also have a tool which is the

1241
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
also i always forget that acronyms it's

1242
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,119
uh oh the the open

1243
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,440
organization of lockpickers there you go

1244
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,880
and uh there you can

1245
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,480
find some resources if you want to get

1246
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,160
into lockpicking

1247
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,280
um for social engineering there isn't

1248
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,000
really

1249
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,760
much resources out there for you to

1250
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,359
learn besides

1251
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,800
a couple of books for example the one

1252
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,880
from chris hagnity which i recommend

1253
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,960
uh which is a social engineering the art

1254
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,160
of human hacking

1255
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,079
you can actually learn a lot from his

1256
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,720
book and also checking out

1257
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,400
socialengineer.org

1258
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,000
um also the in tool us tv this is one

1259
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,720
thing that i i

1260
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,839
actually want to recommend if you want

1261
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,280
to get into lock picking you can check

1262
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,400
out that site

1263
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,560
um they actually have a couple of uh

1264
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
gifs and explainers on how

1265
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,560
ping tumblers work and whatnot it's a

1266
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,079
great resource for if you want to learn

1267
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,680
and get into lock picking

1268
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,839
which is a requirement for for red

1269
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,480
operators

1270
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,040
so moving on forward to social

1271
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,720
engineering so social engineering

1272
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,520
doesn't have

1273
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,240
much requirements or much tools

1274
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,079
one thing that i do recommend for

1275
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,520
example if you want to get into social

1276
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
engineering

1277
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,400
things that i would recommend getting is

1278
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
a hard hat um

1279
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,880
it could be a badge cloner so you can

1280
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,280
create your own badges at house

1281
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,760
and a clipboard usually with these three

1282
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,359
things you can get

1283
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,400
into pretty much almost anywhere

1284
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,560
by impersonating someone um

1285
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,119
also creating online personas hauling

1286
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,960
online aliases

1287
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
let's say you want to get into a

1288
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,880
building

1289
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,079
to give you an idea for example a

1290
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,400
medical facility uh if you want to get

1291
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,119
into there

1292
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,560
all you have to do is some some like

1293
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,400
ocean or what their badges look like you

1294
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
create a fake badge

1295
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,720
uh create an online alias and you're an

1296
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,920
auditor whatever

1297
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
walk in with the clipboard looking all

1298
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,520
professional like sometimes that if you

1299
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,560
actually go into

1300
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,160
places such as goodwill uh turns out

1301
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,119
you might be able to find polos or or

1302
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,480
t-shirts from the company that you're

1303
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,319
actually trying to target

1304
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,319
um which would actually help you social

1305
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,599
engineer your way in

1306
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,760
i mean if you go to go to a square you

1307
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,839
can actually find an att polo in there

1308
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,319
somewhere

1309
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,240
for just five dog five dollars in that

1310
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,319
if if by any chance you're trying to to

1311
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,440
get a polo

1312
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,720
or a t-shirt of the company you're

1313
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
trying to social engineer your way in

1314
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,319
you can't find your goodwill another

1315
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,400
resource is actually the swap shops

1316
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,200
um you can actually go there for 10 20

1317
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,760
maybe

1318
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,240
15 bucks sometimes you can actually have

1319
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
your custom polo of the company that

1320
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,839
you're trying to get into

1321
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,359
all you need is pretty much their logo

1322
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,880
which you can find online

1323
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,800
and places like the swap shop they're

1324
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,480
gonna they're not gonna ask you hey do

1325
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,680
you work at this company

1326
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
no they'll just you know make the poll

1327
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,560
or t-shirt for you

1328
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,599
so um it's it's it's really easy to

1329
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,200
search and engineer your way into

1330
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,119
companies and this is something i should

1331
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,119
be taking a look at the

1332
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,319
be unaware on the lookout for

1333
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,000
and not only that think about it this

1334
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,040
way you're supporting your local

1335
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,720
business and swap shops you know be a

1336
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,599
good person by

1337
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,599
purchasing a goodwill

1338
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,960
so um let's create a sample

1339
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,280
we're going to be fishing mr mr mr john

1340
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,720
doe

1341
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,200
so we do some reconnaissance online mr

1342
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,160
doe he's a c-level executive um

1343
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,400
turns out he's like my brother-in-law

1344
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,319
has no literally no social media

1345
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,280
whatsoever

1346
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,920
well let's say he's uh he's into sports

1347
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,960
he's a heat span

1348
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,200
how did you find out that well turns out

1349
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,880
you were doing reconnaissance into the

1350
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,079
building where he works at

1351
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,240
into um you recognize who he was and his

1352
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,960
vehicle

1353
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,880
and it turns out that on his vehicle he

1354
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,319
had a custom heats

1355
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,800
uh lexus plate holder that way you

1356
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,839
already know he's into

1357
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,680
he's into sports you know you could use

1358
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,200
the heats as an excuse

1359
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,720
to create elaborate uh fishing um

1360
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,640
a phishing email with some attachments

1361
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,160
like hey here's how you

1362
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,560
you were included into the your wife

1363
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,480
including you into this raffle here's

1364
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,200
some

1365
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,880
free heat tickets that you just won you

1366
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,480
know that's one way of fishing

1367
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,560
um if he's married you can actually do

1368
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,800
oceans and social engineering to his

1369
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,440
wife

1370
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,040
chances are if you're able to fish her

1371
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,720
then you can use her credentials and her

1372
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,319
email to actually fish him

1373
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,720
chances are he's not gonna deny an email

1374
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
and not open an email from any

1375
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,839
relative or family members and whatnot

1376
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,000
so another option is actually doing

1377
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,839
social media reconnaissance on

1378
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,839
his wife on any other family members on

1379
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,760
if they have kids on teenagers as well i

1380
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,119
mean it is scary

1381
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,200
but it is something that it is a

1382
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,440
possibility when you're red teaming

1383
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,040
there's no strings attached like

1384
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,640
whatever an attacker

1385
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,599
can do you got to think of it as well

1386
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,319
you gotta

1387
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,400
consider it as a possibility like hey

1388
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,920
would an attacker do this

1389
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,400
chances are they will i mean they don't

1390
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,359
care that you're

1391
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,680
that you know your wife is it's your

1392
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,440
wife or your kids whatever they just

1393
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,640
want to hack you they just want to get

1394
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,680
in they don't care

1395
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,799
no strings attached you know

1396
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,480
so um a lot of questions that i get

1397
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
often well not that often is that

1398
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,559
if anybody can be a red teamer besides

1399
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,000
fantastic

1400
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,040
so and my answer is yes

1401
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,160
anybody can be a red teamer i mean for

1402
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
example in physical processing

1403
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,760
sometimes you'll encounter people with

1404
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,839
that have military background

1405
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,440
um that are in the locksport community

1406
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,839
that they're into um you know bypassing

1407
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,520
and opening locks and whatnot

1408
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,839
a lot of the times they might not have

1409
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,880
uh the

1410
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,079
the requirements or the skills to be a a

1411
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,680
cyber pen tester

1412
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,440
um but they still can't be part of a red

1413
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,040
team i mean if you have

1414
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,559
if you already have a couple of members

1415
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,000
that are actually taking care of the

1416
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,359
tech side of aspects

1417
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,800
and they're good with physical stuff

1418
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
with locks and whatnot sure of course

1419
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
they can be a red team or why not

1420
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,400
and same applies for social engineering

1421
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,920
a lot of people think that you need like

1422
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,680
uh

1423
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,640
like a psychology degree or something or

1424
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,760
be able to

1425
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,559
mentally hack people that's not true but

1426
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,319
you got to be as trustworthy person you

1427
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,280
know

1428
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,440
learn a lot about empathy learn about

1429
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,640
reading people

1430
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,760
humans and uh be able to trick your way

1431
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,319
in you know

1432
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,400
it's all skills and practice uh one

1433
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,680
thing that i like to do that actually

1434
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,400
one

1435
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,119
one skill that i learned from from chris

1436
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:13,839
having me

1437
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:14,960
is that for example whenever you're

1438
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,839
going out and you're going to

1439
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,160
into a restaurant for example you want

1440
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,520
to take a quick view

1441
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,240
of everybody sitting eating when out

1442
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,440
what they're wearing

1443
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,040
and within a couple of minutes try to

1444
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,559
see if you can pinpoint what everybody

1445
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,240
was wearing and whatnot

1446
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,559
uh it's it helps with uh memory skills

1447
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,160
that when you for example you're talking

1448
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,200
to someone

1449
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,640
and you're socially engineering them and

1450
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,240
you see them one day and you talk about

1451
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,520
sports or whatever

1452
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,920
uh two three days later if you see them

1453
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,720
again you

1454
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,240
actually remember what you talked about

1455
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,599
and what not and you can follow up on

1456
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,640
that

1457
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,440
um another thing is that when creating

1458
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,200
online aliases

1459
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
uh when you're using your name this is

1460
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,920
an internal tip when using your name

1461
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,440
try to use your own pressure name

1462
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,280
personally just and just change your

1463
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,000
last name

1464
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,240
because for example if you if your name

1465
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,079
is david but you created an alias and

1466
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,599
online alias

1467
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,839
that says john doe and you're social

1468
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,520
engineering your way into the building

1469
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,880
it turns out that that person actually

1470
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,319
looked you up in linkedin and then saw

1471
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,599
you on the streets a couple days ago

1472
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:14,480
they're going to be yelling on the

1473
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,240
screen hey john doe john doe

1474
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,280
you're not going to remember that it's

1475
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,800
actually you that are calling so at

1476
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,480
least use your first name just change

1477
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,680
out the last name that's

1478
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,040
a little tip for social engineering

1479
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,200
there

1480
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,640
um so another thing to to do

1481
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
is uh once you're you're good at these

1482
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,640
how do you get even better

1483
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,680
um if you're plant testing keep up with

1484
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,520
your tools and exploits

1485
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,440
um be involved in the infosec community

1486
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,480
and all the discord groups defcon red

1487
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,960
team

1488
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,760
hack miami practice all the time you

1489
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,000
know go consistently on try hackney

1490
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,640
go consistently you know hack the box um

1491
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,400
whenever there's a new uh exploit

1492
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,160
release try to get a copy of it

1493
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,880
try to replicate it and practice

1494
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,960
practice practice all the time

1495
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,200
and same is with lock picking it's

1496
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,880
literally no different there's

1497
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,480
locks that are easy to pick you got for

1498
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,079
example those uh

1499
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,440
master laws that you can actually pick

1500
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,280
up at home depot for a couple of dollars

1501
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,559
those you can pick within a couple of

1502
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,480
minutes if it gets harder then

1503
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,079
find a harder lock and improve and

1504
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,079
improve you always have to

1505
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,079
keep on practicing your lock picking

1506
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,680
there's always different locks

1507
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,760
different sorts of techniques and also

1508
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,280
with your implants as well those are

1509
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,800
improving all the time for example if

1510
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,359
you've been

1511
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,319
a hack five fan such as me you've

1512
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,760
noticed that the wi-fi pineapple has

1513
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,359
been improving over the years

1514
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,520
and uh keep up today on your implants

1515
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
and why not

1516
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,319
um for oceans uh there isn't much that

1517
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,160
you need to be taking care of

1518
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,040
um just practice your your deceits with

1519
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,480
friends and family members just for the

1520
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,280
heck of it

1521
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,200
and i mean you don't understand just

1522
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,720
told hey i'm just practicing this with

1523
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,520
you

1524
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,359
um you want to invest into props uh

1525
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,960
one of the most expensive things for

1526
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,640
social engineering i think is a badge

1527
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,520
maker

1528
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,599
um those the cheapest you can find on

1529
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,800
ebay will probably go

1530
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,640
around six hundred dollars give or take

1531
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,400
um it is quite expensive but it's a

1532
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,839
one-time investment

1533
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,760
and the uniforms uniforms you can find

1534
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,119
literally for just a couple of dollars

1535
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,720
like i mentioned you just go to goodwill

1536
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,280
you'll find for five ten dollars at most

1537
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,800
you can find a

1538
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,559
polo or a t-shirt with the logo of the

1539
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,079
company that you're trying to get into

1540
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,680
and if not you can just go to your soft

1541
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,920
shop and have it made there

1542
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,359
so another thing you want to do with the

1543
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,440
ocean is to actually maintain your

1544
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,720
aliases

1545
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,599
whenever you create an online profile um

1546
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,960
every once in a while you want to go

1547
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,400
into those profiles

1548
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,280
post something related to the background

1549
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,400
of that aliases

1550
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,960
just to keep it active active um you

1551
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,640
know you're doing good with that online

1552
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,359
profile

1553
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,280
if every once in a while you'll see the

1554
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,040
recruiter actually reach out to you

1555
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,880
that way you know okay this alley is

1556
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,880
good you know

1557
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,079
um so to sum it up yeah

1558
00:52:54,079 --> 00:53:01,839
any questions

1559
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,520
hi um my name is srinivas um

1560
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,599
questions about what are the some of the

1561
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,720
monitoring tools for online

1562
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,640
uh for like let's say there's a business

1563
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,640
right and the business has

1564
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,640
applications right um and you would want

1565
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,599
to

1566
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,960
do pen testing you want uh what kind of

1567
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,280
tool contesting tools

1568
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,920
i went from the contestant perspective

1569
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,040
and also

1570
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,280
figuring out like from the red team

1571
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,520
perspective how do you find out these

1572
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,119
uh that that that has been a phishing

1573
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,559
attack or something like that can you

1574
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,839
can you chime in all the two

1575
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,040
some tools that you know thank you uh

1576
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,800
for fishing um one common one

1577
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,880
is uh kingfisher that's one of them

1578
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,040
and uh you also have the social

1579
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,800
engineering toolkit

1580
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,839
that's another one then there's a few

1581
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:58,319
other

1582
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,040
um proprietary that i'm allowed i'm not

1583
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,400
allowed to mention here

1584
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
um but the social engineering two okay

1585
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,880
by uh sct by uh dave kennedy

1586
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,800
and trusted sec that's a really good one

1587
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,559
and uh kingfisher as well which is an

1588
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,920
open source one they're both open source

1589
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,559
you don't have to pay anything for them

1590
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,440
thank you and albert for um that's from

1591
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,720
fan testing perspective

1592
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,200
but from the red team perspective how do

1593
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,920
you

1594
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,400
find these attacks right in terms of

1595
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,839
applications and server

1596
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,480
servers and services and stuff like that

1597
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,119
by doing reconnaissance into the company

1598
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,040
to reconnaissance into the company see

1599
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,280
what what's running on their network

1600
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
um see if they're using mobile

1601
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,799
applications if they're using web

1602
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,000
applications

1603
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
um you can find out for example their

1604
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,680
website what it's running by using an

1605
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,960
add-on

1606
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,799
called the wapalizer you can find out

1607
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,280
the backend code libraries and wanna

1608
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,960
and from there you can find out more on

1609
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,319
what's actually running on their network

1610
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,359
here's a uh a question from riley

1611
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,480
he's asking about fido fido security

1612
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,240
keys what's your opinion on them

1613
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,599
um are those are the things

1614
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,520
no i'm not to be honest i'm not familiar

1615
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,960
i'm not that familiar with the with

1616
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,640
fighter city security well

1617
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,440
it's a new security uh two factor

1618
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,160
authentication

1619
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,119
that they're using uh now where it's uh

1620
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,799
it's kind of like um

1621
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,280
using a double key encryption on like a

1622
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,240
certificate

1623
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,520
where you actually keep a uh

1624
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,640
a physical security key that can pair to

1625
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,720
your phone or you can push it over

1626
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,720
bluetooth or put it in usb

1627
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,960
that will be challenged with the graphic

1628
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,000
challenge from

1629
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,400
say set server like an email server to

1630
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,599
protect against phishing but

1631
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,520
they're saying you can also use it to

1632
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,760
protect physical hardware as well

1633
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,200
uh and how that might play into you know

1634
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,400
uh some sort of pen testing

1635
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,079
so regarding pen testing that's pretty

1636
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,000
much almost impossible to bypass if you

1637
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,040
have those in place

1638
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,720
personally i'm not going to die i'm

1639
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,400
actually a big fan of yubikey i've been

1640
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,079
using ubc for the last couple of years

1641
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:06,799
and i

1642
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,920
fantastic product i love it um

1643
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,119
so for the pentax inside

1644
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,280
i dare to say i mean nothing is

1645
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,319
impossible

1646
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,400
um but it's almost impossible to to

1647
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,440
bypass that

1648
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
but when you're doing a physical

1649
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,559
engagement

1650
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,119
um there's a you'd be surprised there's

1651
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,160
a high

1652
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,799
percentage chance that you'll find the

1653
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,040
actual key inside of a drawer in the

1654
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,760
office

1655
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,799
of a facility that you gain access to

1656
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,640
compromising the actual key would

1657
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,160
probably be the width you're actually

1658
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,440
storing the device

1659
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,599
right on the desk next to whatever it is

1660
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,480
you're protecting

1661
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,079
it it makes no sense if you start right

1662
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,520
there right

1663
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,079
right it's sort of it's just shifts the

1664
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:48,640
goal

1665
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,079
but uh once you get it

1666
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,000
you'd be surprised the kind of things

1667
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,599
that i've that i've encountered when

1668
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,240
doing a physical engagement like i've

1669
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,440
seen

1670
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,319
packets of blank checks i've seen uh

1671
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,200
driver lessons

1672
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,160
i've seen passports i've seen containers

1673
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,559
with

1674
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,040
old food i mean you can find anything

1675
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,160
that you can

1676
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,520
