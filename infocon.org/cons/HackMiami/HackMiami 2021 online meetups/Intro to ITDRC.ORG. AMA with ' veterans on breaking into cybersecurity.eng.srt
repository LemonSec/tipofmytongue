empire pacific hackers introduced a very

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
interesting organization

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
called itrtc that has to do with

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,359
disaster recovery

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,480

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,120
uh type of infrastructure help in this

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,079
cases uh

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,879
obviously this is a hack miami meeting

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,760
where florida

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
is i guess uh very familiar with

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
disaster we live through it every six

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,480
months

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,399
we sort of have been lucky the last

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,280
three or four years but

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
if you live in florida you know that

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,960
it's a matter of

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
when uh at one point it's going to

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,239
happen

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,520
and then after that we're going to have

29

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
i have a fan going on in the background

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
yes i hear you yes

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
yeah so it's kind of funny i did a

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
modified version of this a few years ago

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,840
at a deathcon event and brian came up in

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
the crowd and it's like

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,190
dude i work with you

94
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,400
[Laughter]

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
we're in the same yeah i was like how

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
come i never see you he was like well

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
i'm in it

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
so we kind of i mean i'm in uh infosec

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
so i kind of stay in the shadows

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,599
so anyway he and i hit it off and i

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,040
started looping him into some of the

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
projects that we were doing

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
and uh we've gone through several

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
disasters together mostly here in

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
california with wildfires

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
and we're always looking to partner with

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,080
groups like you guys

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
and i think you know where i could see

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
us working together is maybe whenever we

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,879
have more regional

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
events like hurricanes and stuff like

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
that that we need some extra i.t

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,200
talent you guys could be really helpful

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
and then likewise whenever we're

115
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
we have downtime usually in the winter

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,959
when there's no disasters

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
you know our volunteers could uh you

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,160
know partner with

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
partner with you all and attend your

120
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
events and stuff so

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
anyway um can somebody pass me the the

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,160
ball

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
and while i try to fiddle with my

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
computer do you have anything to add

125
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,120
brian

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
yeah so you know getting involved with

127
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,160
this uh

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
itgrc group you know i have to actually

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,759
change hats

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
take off the hacker hacker see i have

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,440
props too here

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,120
there the itdrc hat um

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
you know i i normally you know try to

134
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
hack wi-fi

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
itdrc i'm setting up wi-fi so it's a

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,000
nice

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,199
uh a nice change to be able to put

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,240
our technical talents to use

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,199
to help people you know disaster happens

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,880
you think of people going and

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
uh going in and fighting fires or

142
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,960
digging ditches

143
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,320
or uh providing food um

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
all of those things the logistics around

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,639
at the communications has to happen in

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,080
order for all of that

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
to um you know

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
in order for that to flow so we get in

149
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,479
there

150
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,800
and kind of the the second responders

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
you know after they

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
you know put the fires down or get the

153
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
water cleared and then we go set up

154
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,800
um infrastructure for communication

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
whether it's for the responders

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
or for the evacuees and it's super

157
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
rewarding work

158
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
i basically look after roger introduced

159
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,479
me to the group

160
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,120
i basically lurked and sat in the

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
background and watched a couple of

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
disasters to see what the flow was and

163
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
how it worked and then this last year

164
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
i just went whole hog and jumped in and

165
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
got involved in the field

166
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,120
so you know besides the front line field

167
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,919
work

168
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
and you know crimping cables and

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
going up and putting wi-fi up and

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
setting up phone banks or whatever

171
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
there's a lot of back end work as well

172
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
there's a sock knock work

173
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,800
that has to be done on the back end

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,639
taking all this data knowing where all

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,360
the

176
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
the gear is what sites are up what sites

177
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,759
are down

178
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
you know there's even work you know

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
driving

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,280
trailers from one location to another so

181
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
there's all kinds of levels of work

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
both you know technical logistical

183
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,319
it takes a big team just to get a few

184
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,680
people out in the field

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
so i think i'll let roger explain a

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
little bit more and uh

187
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,800
i really appreciate that he came over to

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
the uh defcon group and uh

189
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
i ran into him there and met my

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
co-worker somewhere else

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
um we have a lot of just to let you know

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
too we do have

193
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,160
a number of people from the infosec

194
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
space

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
it's actually surprising infosec people

196
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
really like to get involved with this so

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,080
this is a really natural pool of talent

198
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,479
because we're used to dealing with

199
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,520
disasters

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
and chaos i think it lends itself to

201
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
this kind of

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,800
volunteering so i'll let roger take it

203
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
away a little more i could

204
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
keep on talking because i had way too

205
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
much coffee

206
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,080
hey could somebody pass me the presenter

207
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
ball on

208
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,240
uh go to meeting you know he's gonna

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,199
call rod

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
yeah it looks like he's step away so

211
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,880
give give me a second let me

212
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
or marco if you have presenter rights i

213
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
shared it with you and i could just tell

214
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,599
you when to go slide

215
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,000
you know go to the next one i don't

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,520
think i have them to be honest

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,960
okay yeah

218
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,039
so i was actually interested when i saw

219
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,599
rod post about the itdrc so i went on

220
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
the site i started looking around

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,000
and i clicked on the volunteer page and

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
i noticed

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,360
like that you guys have a section for

224
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
technical skills

225
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
and it looks like it was mainly focused

226
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,560
around like a window shop

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
is the is that kind of what the deal is

228
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,319
or

229
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,560
no it depends i think uh we typically

230
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
have a lot of i.t generalists that join

231
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
um i mean most of our stuff to be

232
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
brutally honest

233
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
is you know i teach stuff that you would

234
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
do for helping your parents

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
at home you know a lot of you know

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
little uh

237
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,120
little setups a printer a computer wi-fi

238
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,399
you know sometimes we have a satellite

239
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
uplink and stuff like that so i think

240
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
windows skills are kind of important

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,599
just because

242
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
our ball are the people we're serving

243
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
are often using windows but that's not

244
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,799
specific i mean there's there's all

245
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
sorts of stuff brian and i

246
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
um do some of the more uh

247
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
you know since we work at the internet

248
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
we do a lot of stuff with the fortinet

249
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
we try to offload that as much as we can

250
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
different people come in with different

251
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
skills

252
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
you know believe it or not tech is

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
actually not what we need the most

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
sometimes it's more

255
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
projected management program management

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
stuff like that um so yeah i think maybe

257
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
we could do a better job on that form

258
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
and capturing some of the skills

259
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,640
um that it may be what we need but uh

260
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,920
yeah if you have any feedback on that

261
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
let's let's chat afterwards

262
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,560
yeah i mean we deal with chromebooks out

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
there in the field and it really doesn't

264
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,200
matter

265
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,760
i think the forum is just a way to say

266
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
you know here's an example of some

267
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
things but

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
you know i i basically put on the forum

269
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
when i joined you know i hacked

270
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
everything so

271
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,399
you know doesn't matter one thing i

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,880
don't

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
see on your website though is who do you

274
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
have memorandums of understanding with

275
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,040
from governmental and other support

276
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
groups who are you support your

277
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
supporting uh we have quite a few i mean

278
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
fema we work with them at the local

279
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
level depending on

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
you know the disaster we work a lot with

281
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
boads

282
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,959
um volunteers active uh after a disaster

283
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
um we work a lot with uh

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
emergency communications uh groups

285
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
work a lot with uh you know verizon

286
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120

287
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,839
that they have um you know kind of these

288
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,600
cult these these stat cults that they

uh and uh you know provide temporary uh

291
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
cell services and stuff like that so we

292
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
do have a lot we just

293
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,360
i mean there's only so much you can put

294
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
on a web page right it would just be

295
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
overloaded with logos but if you ever if

296
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,959
you ever deploy with this you'll

297

rollout program so fun little projects

312

313
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
fun and carry more weight than the

314
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,880

340
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,079
okay um yeah so we're a 501c3

341
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,239
um non-profit we're based out of dallas

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,599
yeah echo from patrice there

343
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,839
so we started uh in texas um you know

344
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,560
there's a lot of

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,600
tornadoes and um uh

346
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
hurricanes in texas and uh

347
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
as as we started to kind of branch out

348
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,519
to the west coast whenever i first

349
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,240
started

350
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,360
about 2014 or 15 or so

351
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,639
they didn't we didn't do a lot in um in

352
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,079
uh here in the uh in california

353
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
so most of our stuff was kind of you

354
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,519
know related to hurricanes

355
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,200
um we work with uh emergency management

356
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
or agencies like we talked about

357
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,600
disaster relief

358
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
organizations and then the technology

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
community in general

360
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,320
a lot of our stuff comes from donations

361
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,839
of these big companies and it's actually

362
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
easier for them to donate to us

363
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
and then have us break out that donation

364
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
and give it to the little

365
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
uh you know little little uh

366
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
organizations here's some quick stats

367
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,839
from this last year

368
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,360
um 2020 was just absolutely insane

369
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
because we we double tripled quadrupled

370
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,839
many of our projects with

371
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,560
a lot of cobit relief stuff which i'll

372
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
cover later

373
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
in a project we call the

374
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,079
project connect uh we have about i think

375
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,360
it's like 26

376
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,279
27 100 people now so these are mostly

377
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,480
people in the

378
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,199
kind of general i.t range um a lot of

379
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,320
kind of generalists

380
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
i think those are um yeah i think once

381
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,399
you get on the coast you get a little

382
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,120
bit more specialized uh talent but uh

383
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,279
in general that's the kind of people who

384
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
who join

385
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,360
um we've serviced over a thousand

386
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
communities

387
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,360
we we have a our asset value that we

388
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
have donated that we then donate out is

389
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
about five million dollars

390
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,600
and we have a lot of tech assets that we

391
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
actually track all of that

392
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,480
and what we do for the community

393
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
our site absolutely skyrocketed this

394
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,399
last year because of our project connect

395
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
i forget what the numbers are i think

396
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
it's got a thousand or so sites that we

397
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,639
put up

398
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
a lot of these were schools and

399
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
libraries and places like that so kids

400
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
kids could uh could get online

401
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
and then uh brian had mentioned earlier

402
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
kind of what we do we have a priority to

403
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,920
what

404
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
kind of who we service you know the

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
first priority is always like

406
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,480
life safety so this is the emergency

407
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,000
managers and people like that who

408
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,519
respond first

409
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
um you know mass care is the second

410
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
so think like the uh the red cross

411
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
shelters the fairgrounds where all the

412
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
survivors

413
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,519
come etc and then community covering

414
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,279
would be something like a church that's

415
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,240
that's you know

416
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
providing uh different services kind of

417
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,079
on a long-term basis

418
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,120
and then long-term recovery um you know

419
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
we'll do a lot of campgrounds

420
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
that that they'll kind of set aside for

421
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,079
people who are

422
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,440
kind of rebuilding their lives we'll

423
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
bring in satellites in there and

424
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
uh and stuff like that anything you want

425
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
to add here brian on this slide

426
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
or even on the other two slides i think

427
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,360
that's good

428
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,839
it's uh and over the last couple years

429
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,600
being in the field i've certainly seen

430
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,279
a few different areas of this you know

431
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,839
we'll bring fire departments back online

432
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,839
when there's no other communications we

433
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
did that during the fires this last year

434
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
um you know evacuees

435
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,199
definitely seeing a lot of shelter

436
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
locations we've got a project here in

437
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
california

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,279
where we're looking at all the

439
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
fairgrounds throughout california

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
and assessing what happens you know when

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,959
there's the

442
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,759
earthquake and we need to get supplies

443
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,440
out there what do we do so we're

444
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,279
pre-planning we're getting kind of ahead

445
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,720
of the curve uh

446
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,600
so we we need a lot of project planning

447
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,160
uh

448
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,759
skills as well in our teams so that's i

449
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
guess what i would add

450
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,160
i was saying um you know regarding what

451
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,759
uh what brian said about the project

452
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,120
management

453
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,240
um a lot of that's a really important

454
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,680
skill because a lot of the it people

455
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,880
will just kind of come and go they'll

456
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,440
come for

457
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,959
you know donate a few hours and then

458
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,959
leave and having someone who thinks in

459
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
terms of service delivery

460
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
can all always help offer a you know

461
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
consistent um

462
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
service to the people that we serve it

463
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
is often really important

464
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,799
so you got people with project skills

465
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,160
please please let us know

466
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,079
so here's kind of uh of a graph of where

467
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
uh we've been um putting up stuff as you

468
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
can see there in the pacific northwest a

469
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
lot of that was fire

470
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,000
and uh the covet response um

471
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
our copic response called project 19. uh

472
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,840
we do have a lot in

473
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
new mexico now because of that too

474
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,000
particularly with some of our

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
uh stuff that we're doing with tribal

476
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
nations um

477
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,799
a couple uh a few months ago brian and i

478
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
actually went to eastern sierras and put

479
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
in a bunch of

480
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,520
some access points which you can see

481
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,919
there um

482
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,320
and yeah a lot of stuff on the east

483
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,600
coast a lot of stuff there in

484
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,919
puerto rico we were really active in

485
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,039
hurricane maria and then

486
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,960
of course a lot of stuff there on the

487
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
gulf of texas

488
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
and the gulf in in general so all these

489
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,760
green dots here

490
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
are active sites the red dots have been

491
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
closed down

492
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
so here's some of our capabilities um we

493
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
have different nims types vehicles

494
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280
which uh for those of you not in

495
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
emergency management they're a

496
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,120
particular

497
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
class of vehicle with certain you know

498
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
certain size certain capabilities etc

499
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
and then we we often get requested uh

500
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
for particular resources from the uh

501
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
from the different regions

502
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,280
um we do have a critical

503
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,480
a cis team for critical infrastructure

504
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,799
and this sort of role requires a

505
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,600
background check

506
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
so um in addition to you know certain

507
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,360
skills

508
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,320
um our volunteers are kind of aligned in

509
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
one of ten regions across the u.s

510
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,600
similar to how fema is and that helps us

511
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,280
kind of map out to the

512
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
you know the different emergency

513
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,080
managers that we work closely with

514
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
and here's kind of a general list of you

515
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,280
know the assets we have

516
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,400
um kind of what you'd expect

517
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,320
you know you need for any sort of i.t

518
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
stuff you know

519
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,720
computers printers cabling

520
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,600
you know routers of some sort all of

521
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,360
this cache is actually in dallas

522
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,840
and this was uh this is kind of a list

523
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,679
of things that we offer for survivors

524
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,280
in these different uh clinics and uh our

525
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,480
shelters this one was uh in uh the

526
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
campfire up in um

527
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,880
up in chico area and paradise

528
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
and this is actually actually i think i

529
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
took this picture this is this is the

530
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
guy i worked with uh

531
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
there and he worked at amazon but um you

532
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
know a lot of stuff we're doing there in

533
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
the shelters are so people can kind of

534
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,000
rebuild their lives fill out insurance

535
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,039
insurance paperwork keep their kids busy

536
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,039
um keep them entertained keep their

537
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,720
phones charged you know that sort of

538
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,039
thing

539
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,600
a lot of that stuff they just don't have

540
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,280
uh the fairgrounds just aren't prepared

541
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
for this many people

542
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
just kind of slamming their wi-fi so we

543
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,960
kind of add a lot of

544
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,640
extra capabilities there you have

545
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
anything you want to add there brian on

546
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,559
the last

547
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,320
few slides yeah i was going to say that

548
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
you know besides the

549
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,039
you know the very physical work of going

550
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,520
putting

551
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,320
all of this stuff into place you know

552
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,280
whether it's

553
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,440
you know we utilize you know anything

554
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
from fortinet gear to meraki to aruba to

555
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
ruckus to

556
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
ubiquity whatever we get our hands on

557
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
whatever we have in our cache

558
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
but when we're putting this all up we're

559
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,480
out there in the field there's people on

560
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,760
the back end

561
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
typing away and making sure that all

562
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
this connects to the cloud controllers

563
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
and things like that

564
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
so again there's we work very hand in

565
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
hand you know with the

566
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
field deployment and the people out

567
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,280
there are cabling everything up and

568
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
getting dirty and sweaty in the heat

569
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
and then the people on the back end

570
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,799
sitting on their couch staying cool and

571
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,159
drinking a soda and

572
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,640
making sure it all works so yeah

573
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
and project coordinators i i'm not gonna

574
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
i'll keep harping on that because we

575
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
need people that can do

576
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
project management project coordination

577
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,480
so the technical skills uh

578
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,600
vary you don't have to be a wi-fi

579
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
wizard who knows how to produce heat

580
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
maps we have people that do that

581
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,159
so yeah

582
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,320
yeah i know that's a that's a good

583
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
that's a good point i you know i tell

584
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,360
people for every one person out there

585
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,039
there's 10 people supporting them i mean

586
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,919
you need someone to

587
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,240
to plan their hotels you need someone to

588
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
plan their food you need someone to

589
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
make sure that uh you know start

590
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,159
organizing the trello cards with all of

591
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,480
the inbound requests and figure out

592
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
who to go to you know take take for

593
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
example this site here you know we

594
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,159
i remember this site there was just

595
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,360
always a rotating

596
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,000
um ic incident commander that we had to

597
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
kind of deal with here and finding out

598
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,039
who that next person was was just such a

599
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,200
chore so for you know him to hang this

600
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,840
ap

601
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,600
like dozens of hours had to go into

602
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
kind of if not hundreds of hours to kind

603
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,720
of figure out

604
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
you know the right people and where to

605
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,559
hang it and all that stuff so

606
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,320
yeah we always need people on the back

607
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
end helping us

608
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,320
inventorying and stuff like that

609
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,640
um yeah we work with a lot of ngos this

610
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,840
particular picture

611
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
is where they process a lot of like the

612
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,400
volunteers

613
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
so you know they'll come in and people

614
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,159
will uh they'll have to get them

615
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,039
processed

616
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,120
uh they sometimes don't have any sort of

617
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,799
network so we'll set up some sort of ad

618
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,799
hoc network that needs to

619
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,120
survive you know days or weeks or maybe

620
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,000
a few months

621
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
um and then we'll kind of cuss taylor

622
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
make something

623
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,679
something for them um

624
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,200
yeah just anyway we do have uh some some

625
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,320
some uh some assets that we that we'll

626
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,120
drive around

627
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
um this one is in tu2

628
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
um we have screens in there and then a

629
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,919
lot of the other agency people

630
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
will come in and work and collaborate uh

631
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,559
on different projects uh this is one of

632
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,679
the nims class

633
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,679
i think it's the nims one and m4 i can't

634
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,039
remember which ones which was the

635
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,919
highest

636
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
uh vehicle this is one of the

637
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,000
events that we had here at google um

638
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
yeah got together and had some exercises

639
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,840
had some challenges

640
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,880
some role-playing events

641
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
and a little bit more about what we what

642
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
we do

643
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,159
i think we covered most of this and then

644
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,960
just some of

645
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
briefly some of the different projects

646
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
that we've been working as you can see

647
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,039
there's

648
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,159
there's a guy up there hanging in ap on

649
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,880
on the silo i took these two here out in

650
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
california

651
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
the one on the right is actually a camp

652
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,240
that uh

653
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,960
that uh brian watson was uh he was the

654
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
incident commander on that particular

655
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
deployment and that's one of our

656
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,960
partners

657
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,159
climbing up a pole to uh hang these

658
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
units prior to this it was just what was

659
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
what was it out there before you they

660
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,279
put up these aps it was just like a

661
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,159
little

662
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,400
cow or cult or something that wasn't

663
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,520
very

664
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,799
yeah they had they had a

665
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
t-mobile had a truck just beating one

666
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
part of the lot at t was on the other

667
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,520
side

668
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,600
and then they had a ubiquity

669
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,279
infrastructure that was completely

670
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,240
broken

671
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,080
so we went and hung these up and lit up

672
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,720
this rv and camp evacuation center

673
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,679
for a few hundred people yeah a lot of

674
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,960
these places like for example this

675
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
particular camp i mean they

676
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
they didn't have wi-fi in the areas

677
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
where they put all the survivors they

678
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,640
just had them you know in particular

679
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,679
areas

680
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,760
um and so you know they need this kind

681
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
of surgic capacity

682
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
and a lot of cases after they get kind

683
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,120
of spun up they might be that

684
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,200
that site indefinitely for each each

685
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
year around this disaster time

686
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,559
so you know we'll work with them kind of

687
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,000
an ongoing basis that's something

688
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,440
brian's doing now with a lot of the

689
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
campgrounds

690
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,120
um here in california or fairgrounds i

691
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
should say

692
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
um yeah like this is i don't know if you

693
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
guys see that but that's uh

694
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,480
that is a uh star link right there

695
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,559
and we set up our stuff behind that

696
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,679
um something we did for hurricane laura

697
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
i was not part of that one um

698
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,320
well what's part of this one though

699
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
these these are all firefighters

700
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,480
and we set up some satellites and gave

701
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
them covered this area with wi-fi

702
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
and the firefighters were thrilled to be

703
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,640
able to uh

704
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,320
to uh you know talk to their kids and

705
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
stuff at night and you know watch movies

706
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
and

707
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
all sorts of stuff we set up some

708
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
charging stations here

709
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
so that's we love the charging stations

710
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,720
um we set up uh

711
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
yeah set up a bank of satellites and

712
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
something brian and i are working on now

713
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
with quarter net gear is kind of an

714
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
sd-wan solution aggregating all of these

715
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,679
different links

716
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,919
and so making it seamless to everyone

717
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,600
behind it they just know that

718
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,919
you know they get in they get an ip and

719
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,720
it works and

720
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
on the back end we'll set up different

721
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
solutions and when one

722
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,039
you know lan link drops out they'll not

723
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
even know that it switches over to the

724
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
other one

725
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,760
uh yeah lots of these charging stations

726
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
the uh

727
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,480
the firemen absolutely love it

728
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
and uh we actually are doing drone

729
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,679
assessments now one of the guys on our

730
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,799
groups he

731
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,120
he is um does this uh he's an ex-googler

732
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
and we have gotten gotten a bunch of

733
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,159
information

734
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,279
and set it to the different uh uh fire

735
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,640
department the police

736
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,960
and it's been really helpful for them to

737
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,240
kind of figure out how to coordinate

738
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
things and then it's also helpful for

739
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,799
people

740
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,559
um as they start to fill out their

741
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,000
insurance claims early

742
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,279
because they can actually you know

743
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,520
document that their place is destroyed

744
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
um you know one thing we often do need

745
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,120
and this is something that

746
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
you know i'm sure people here would know

747
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
is we often need local partners to

748
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
quickly upload all this information to

749
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,279
so if you know of any

750
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,360
anyone who's on like you know the

751
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,480
internet backbone

752
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
and we could get them a drive and they

753
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,320
could quickly upload stuff to buckets

754
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,840
that would be enormously helpful because

755
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,520
sometimes we just have to

756
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,120
sneaker net this you know 12 hours

757
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,039
somewhere else to

758
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,760
to get it uploaded that point point to

759
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
point link we did

760
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,320
and then this was our kovid 19 request

761
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,960
that we were

762
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
that i was talking to about earlier i

763
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,080
think we're up

764
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,520
a few more than that now so anyway

765
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,440
um anything else i feel like i've talked

766
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,919
too much

767
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
another shot inside our vehicle

768
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,399
can't uh donation management is a huge

769
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:50,799
deal

770
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,039
we'll come up with some clever solutions

771
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,640
on kind of helping

772
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,279
helping uh police document all these

773
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,720
believe it or not when people go down

774
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
and donate stuff that's a huge pain in

775
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,279
the butt for

776
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
these organizations they don't have an

777
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
inventory system they don't

778
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
have a way to give out gifts fairly they

779
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,799
don't have a way to find out who's you

780
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,679
know

781
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,600
who's really lost their house for this

782
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
so a lot of times

783
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
you know police and fire will loop us in

784
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
just to kind of figure out okay how do

785
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
we inventory this how do we

786
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,039
you know create a database of everything

787
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,080
keep track anyway

788
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,399
that's it for me any other questions or

789
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,919
questions about involvement or what we

790
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,919
do or

791
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,799
anything more i do have a link here if

792
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,960
people are interested

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
yeah i'll just add another thing to it

794
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
this that

795
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,640
you know even if you don't if you don't

796
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
know exactly what you would do

797
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,240
it's always good to just sign up

798
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,600
go through all the uh exercises

799
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,799
of becoming deployable and

800
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,760
and then something will come up and

801
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,480
you'll say oh

802
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,960
that's something i can do when i first

803
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,159
signed up

804
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,000
i was so busy with other things there's

805
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,279
no you know there was no way i was going

806
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:09,760
to

807
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,240
go out in the field and deploy um i

808
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
didn't i couldn't do that time

809
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
commitment but then when the opportunity

810
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,679
hit i was all ready to go

811
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,919
uh and i was very glad that i did that

812
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,360
so

813
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,799
yeah and to touch on that what brian

814
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
said i mean we don't it's not like you

815
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,679
could just sign up and

816
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,520
jump on a plane and go right i mean we

817
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
have safety first is a big deal

818
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,840
so you know we ask people to go through

819
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,279
the safety training

820
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
uh you know command chain chain of

821
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,880
command is really important as we work

822
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
with other agencies so

823
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,760
kind of knowing what the ics uh terms

824
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,080
are

825
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
and working with that is really

826
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,520
important um

827
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,840
so you know sometimes your site you sign

828
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,200
up you get to know

829
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,039
all the tools you get to know the people

830
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,960
you get to know you know the trello

831
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
boards the slack

832
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,919
channels all that stuff and then um

833
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,520
then we'll send out requests for

834
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,039
particular areas and if you live in that

835
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,919
area we'll

836
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,080
often ask locals to come first and then

837
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
later

838
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,399
possibly fly someone in so it sounds

839
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,520
like you're

840
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,440
you're a much larger group you're about

841
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
overlapping with the ieee move

842
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,760
group which also does deploy satellite

843
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,320
trucks

844
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,200
and stuff yeah yeah there's a lot of us

845
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,679
we

846
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,120
work together in the field although i

847
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,960
haven't actually seen them in the field

848
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
i've seen a lot of the others

849
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,000
um but yeah i've seen i've seen i've

850
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
seen their web page and they look like

851
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,679
they're doing some good stuff

852
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,000
because i've talked to the one of their

853
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,120
people on the phone once

854
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
just just in general yes this is not

855
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,520
stuff you can since september 11th this

856
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
is not stuff you can just

857
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
go out and run into the field last

858
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
minute and you're going to have a few

859
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,919
hundred thousand people just all of a

860
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,320
sudden last minute want to volunteer

861
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
after the disaster happens you can't do

862
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,399
that not with all the background checks

863
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,640
and stuff they require nowadays

864
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
yep yeah we have a we have a background

865
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,720
check too that we ask people to go

866
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,559
through and then

867
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,919
i mean which makes sense right because

868
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,600
you're dealing with survivors data you

869
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,480
know as you can see

870
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
we in that previous picture there was a

871
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,720
a bunch of uh teddy bears

872
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,480
i hate to have those stolen or i could

873
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
you can't say the ics courses if you

874
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
won't ever take them are free they're

875
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
just on fema's website

876
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,320
yep correct yeah there's four that we

877
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,279
that we recommend

878
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,080
and two that are mandatory before we we

879
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,879
have you deploy

880
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,000
this is uh incredible from what i've

881
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
seen here you guys are doing

882
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,799
a lot of work and i really don't want us

883
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,679
to dev

884
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,960
or devolve into politics too much but it

885
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,840
looks like uh

886
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,799
you guys should actually be the female

887
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,600
and coordinate

888
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,399
female and police because it looks like

889
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:50,960
uh

890
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,120
what you are doing is actually it's

891
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
almost like uh

892
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,279
fema is actually not doing it's what

893
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,559
it's supposed to do also

894
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,080
or maybe i'm over thinking this

895
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,880
because it looks like uh to be efficient

896
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,799
from what you've presented

897
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,559
you guys should actually be in the place

898
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,159
of fema and then coordinate

899
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,159
on the police i mean it all depends

900
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,000
remember fema's only kind of pulled in

901
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,159
at the uh declared disaster a lot of our

902
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:18,880
work is in

903
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,840
areas it's some little podunk city that

904
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,279
got hit by a hurricane

905
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,840
and you know it hasn't been declared a

906
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,120
disaster it may have just been a

907
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,159
particular school that got flooded so

908
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,799
you know uh fema gets called in for the

909
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,440
big big

910
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,919
disasters and you know money gets poured

911
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,679
in a lot of our work is what

912
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,600
is is the areas outside of that that

913
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,960
often doesn't make the news

914
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,000
yeah yeah but it looks like a

915
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,679
a subtle uh agreement that perhaps the

916
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,880
that loca area government is not really

917
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
responsible to its people so

918
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,919
if uh they can't take care of uh

919
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,840
in a disaster they don't have results

920
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,360
it's not that they're not responsible

921
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,399
it's just

922
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,080
it's like the cell phone towers and

923
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,159
they're probably compared to normal use

924
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,399
they're overwhelmed

925
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,080
correct i mean and let's be honest

926
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,000
nobody's responsive when your whole

927
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,919
infrastructure gets blown away i mean

928
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,919
you've got to kind of bring in folks

929
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,960
from other regions

930
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,440
with you know generators and satellites

931
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
and all this stuff to help you so

932
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,039
i i think it's kind of hard to be the

933
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,159
i.t person

934
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,760
for your company or for your group

935
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,240
whenever you yourself lost your home

936
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,840
and we see a lot of that sort of thing

937
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,679
i have a question about oh sorry go

938
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,399
ahead

939
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,760
yeah i have a question about uh the

940
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,440
timeline for deployment from training

941
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,799
and background checks more or less what

942
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,519
that is like

943
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,880
do you have self-paced trainings are

944
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,039
they virtual do you have to be in person

945
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,559
um yeah so we we have uh

946
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,080
the two that are that really are really

947
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
important are the the ics

948
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,440
ones uh or is it i see i i csi

949
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,200
ifc um those are online you can just

950
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,159
take a test

951
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,559
and uh we do have a safety one that's

952
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,279
that's a virtual one that you can take

953
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,799
talks about kind of what we do what a

954
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,480
deployment's like etc

955
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,639
but to actually help help us remotely

956
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
that's not a big deal i mean

957
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,280
we can basically give you uh give you a

958
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,040
log in to our inventory management and

959
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,440
start

960
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,359
you know helping us organize as we

961
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,760
scramble and put these up that's

962
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,440
lots of lots of roles there and that's

963
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,280
how a lot of people start they kind of

964
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,000
figure out

965
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
what the tools are and what needs to be

966
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,480
done and what the process is and then

967
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,079
if they ever do deploy then they're you

968
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,918
know a little bit more productive out

969
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,560
there

970
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,239
once you get it so

971
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,599
i would say you know realistically

972
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,320
at least figure a couple of months

973
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,760
you know looking at the the

974
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
communications looking at the the talk

975
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,480
back and forth

976
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
understand the flow and how everybody

977
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,239
works and then

978
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,719
you'll then you'll see opportunities pop

979
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,440
up so every

980
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
every month or two we see opportunities

981
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
pop up and a call

982
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
goes out to say okay anybody in this

983
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
area can

984
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
you know can you help out with this

985
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,800
project

986
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,160
and then people put in their uh

987
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,280
capabilities yeah we we use

988
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
everbridge to kind of target people in

989
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,680
the local area and then if we can't find

990
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,400
them we kind of

991
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,599
you know create a bigger and bigger

992
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,760
radius and

993
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
try to you know try to get people that

994
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,320
way

995
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,839
so yeah you could do it in a couple

996
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,119
months that should be reasonable

997
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,480
okay but unfortunately go ahead

998
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,880
sorry i keep interrupting people i'm so

999
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,000
awful at this um

1000
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,520
my final question is would you recommend

1001
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,040
this for anybody who's new to tech or

1002
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,400
that is primarily or is this like

1003
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,680
primarily aimed at seasoned

1004
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,040
professionals i know that you said that

1005
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,320
there are a few roles that you can just

1006
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,839
come on to that don't have anything to

1007
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,200
do with tech but if i wanted to for

1008
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,079
example

1009
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,359
um as an early career professional

1010
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,240
come in and maybe even shadow people who

1011
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,359
are doing something

1012
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,839
uh that i'd be interested in is that or

1013
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,599
is this so critical that you can't do

1014
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,280
anything like that

1015
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,800
no there's there's lots of roles like

1016
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,480
that as a matter of fact uh

1017
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,160
we have a very healthy job uh job uh

1018
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,920
everyone's called hookup network in our

1019
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
group too and a lot of people will

1020
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,720
actually look

1021
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,359
and recruit from this group because they

1022
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,640
you know seen people demonstrate their

1023
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,800
skills and stuff so

1024
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,640
and out in the field there's plenty of

1025
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,400
opportunity i mean teaching people how

1026
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,960
to

1027
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,160
you know how to put ends on a cat5 cable

1028
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,359
you start with that

1029
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,599
pull some cable do do the grunt work

1030
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,280
then start learning the console

1031
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,760
learning how to how to control you know

1032
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,040
how to do meraki

1033
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
importing that cisco gear setup

1034
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,480
that kind of comes along with it so it's

1035
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,920
not designed to be a training center but

1036
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,160
you know you put in the work and

1037
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,440
training just comes

1038
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,560
as part of the process yeah and i know

1039
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,960
some

1040
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,119
vps of operations that pretty much

1041
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,800
exclusively recruit from

1042
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,720
this group because you know it's an easy

1043
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
way to see what people are made of it's

1044
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,520
an easy way to cross

1045
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,200
reference people to see how they've how

1046
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
they've done the different operations

1047
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
um it's a great way to kind of see every

1048
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,440
single vendor under the sun

1049
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,960
and kind of you know just see how

1050
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,640
innovative people are whenever they're

1051
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,000
whenever they're presented with problems

1052
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,839
yeah and and we're very vendor agnostic

1053
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,880
i mean i i've been at fortinet

1054
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,960
since 2006. um and

1055
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,520
although i should say yes we only use

1056
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,760
fortinet no we don't i i set up merakis

1057
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
i set up broncos and

1058
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,720
everything else so yeah imagine being a

1059
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,800
chef and you've got to cook for

1060
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,160
thousands of people and you've got to

1061
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,680
like make do with whatever ingredients

1062
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,760
you're given that's kind of what

1063
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,800
what it is so some people love that

1064
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
challenge and some people are you know

1065
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,079
frustrated because they can't

1066
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,359
provision things like they're always

1067
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,599
used to provisioning but yep

1068
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,599
um but to love this smelly chaos in the

1069
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,040
morning yeah

1070
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,359
if you like challenges we have you know

1071
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,720
tons of problems for you and when you

1072
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,280
get

1073
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,800
finished fixing those we'll give you

1074
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,880
some more as a thank you

1075
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,160
the sort of environment it is

1076
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
any other questions amy or anyone else

1077
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,040
or

1078
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
we're trying to get marcos in the field

1079
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,400
that's uh

1080
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,480
that's that's my that's my 2021 goal

1081
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
that's the next big fire he's going to

1082
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,520
come and

1083
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,160
help us stream

1084
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah i got the tools i

1085
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,079
can tell you that i you know because i

1086
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,240
did it on my phone

1087
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,480
all right well i guess i got you down

1088
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,599
dude

1089
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,680
let's just just just don't trip the the

1090
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,399
refugees

1091
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,040
it looks like you deal with uh a lot of

1092
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,599
data

1093
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,040
i may have missed this do you have

1094
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,680
a company like salesforce donating to

1095
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,880
usa here

1096
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,240
use our crm for free because uh

1097
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,160
we believe in the course also because

1098
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,279
you have a lot of data

1099
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
yeah we have salesforce i think some of

1100
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,000
these vendors are incredibly generous

1101
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,720
and others

1102
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,839
are trying to see enough an opportunity

1103
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,320
to

1104
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
you know get paid um

1105
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,839
as you can imagine we try to use as much

1106
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,079
open source stuff as we can just more

1107
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,920
control and hackability and the more

1108
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,440
developers we get in you know when we

1109
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,480
first started we didn't

1110
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,240
we had a lot of generality people not a

1111
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,920
lot of developers and i think the more

1112
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,599
people we got from

1113
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,440
places like google and red hat and

1114
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
different linux shops we started to

1115
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,040
develop some capabilities that we didn't

1116
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,320
have before

1117
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
um and that's kind of one of the reasons

1118
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,119
that brian and i kind of reach out to

1119
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,960
groups like this is i think we

1120
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,839
need to start creating our own tools and

1121
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,680
be much more self-sufficient and not

1122
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,040
reliant on fast schools

1123
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,960
and marco um i know how we're going to

1124
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,359
get you into the field

1125
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,400
the next employment the next deployment

1126
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,319
you get your hoodie oh yeah

1127
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,319
brian got us blockbuster hoodies from

1128
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,880
the last blockbuster up in bed

1129
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,200
yeah i was up there on a project and uh

1130
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
stop by there's actually one

1131
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,200
one more blockbuster in existence and

1132
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
that's it

1133
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,960
so and he got a picture of the backdraft

1134
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,280
uh dvd with with his hat on top

1135
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
and the blockbuster background it's

1136
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
pretty funny yeah

1137
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
so yeah we get to go to cool places too

1138
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
sometimes and we cross zones so you know

1139
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,400
we'll i may end up in my miami at some

1140
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,880
point

1141
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,359
you never know my uh my father lives

1142
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,480
down there in uh

1143
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,520
west palm beach so okay

1144
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,720
you guys know you guys know um the world

1145
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,040
our

1146
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,920
world central kitchen

1147
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,200
okay we work a lot with them

1148
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
and and groups like them so they'll do

1149
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,599
you know but big gigantic mass feeding

1150
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,880
sort of uh setups

1151
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,800
and we'll work with them but i think

1152
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,079
that they they do a lot of stuff in

1153
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:12,880
hurricanes

1154
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,560
they're really active in they started in

1155
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,839
hurricane maria in puerto rico

1156
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760

i grew up in miami and i still have a

1165
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,000
little bit of trauma from

1166
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,160
hurricane andrew and i've spent at least

1167
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,359
i don't know maybe two or three months

1168
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,720
of my life without power

1169
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,079
so any way that i can get back and make

1170
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,280
things a little bit more comfortable for

1171

1317
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,040
anybody and this is for all of the panel

1318
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,680

felt like it was something straight out

1320
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,839
of the movies

1321
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
that has to go back to prolexic right

1322
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,319
i think i think we would all agree uh

1323
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,599
uh that if that

1324
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,520
probably going back to prolexic i think

1325
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,599

1328
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,880
it felt like it was not a job we we

1329

actually did what we love

1330

tuna will be here for example if he was

1338
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,319
alive he was

1339
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,880
he was somebody that truly influenced us

1340
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,599
and help us

1341
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,680
and he's the one who started bringing a

1342
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,800
lot of us

1343
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,839
um into prolex it i'm not sure if

1344
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:28,640
patrice

1345
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,839
has one of those uh anecdotes of uh

1346
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,160
prolexa

1347
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,559
yeah so for those who don't know

1348
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,440
prolexic

1349
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,640
we all work together at prolexic before

1350
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,559
it you know in the past before where we

1351
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,839
are now

1352
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,079
um and it was a a startup company and so

1353
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,319
the company kind of built as we were

1354
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,359
there

1355
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,599
and um it was it was definitely a case

1356
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,559
of the

1357
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,440
right group of people with the right

1358
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,400
chemistry at the right time

1359
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,960
and what prolexic did was ddos

1360
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,839
protection

1361
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,040
so when a

1362
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,000
an organization that was our client

1363
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,960
started to get a ddos attack

1364
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,319
prolexic would essentially um

1365
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,319
step in front of that organization take

1366
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,319
the attack apart analyze it

1367
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,839
determine what the problem was and then

1368
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,480
um create a solution for it create

1369
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,720
essentially like a like a signature for

1370
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,160
a virus

1371
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,359
and so it was um

1372
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,559
very interesting because you know you

1373
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,480
would be doing a day's work and then all

1374
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,319
of a sudden you would just

1375
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,000
you know there were big panels and you

1376
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,800
would see the traffic start to rise

1377
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,520
and you would feel the um

1378
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,079
you just it was temperatures

1379
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,200
running from one side to the other guns

1380
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
everywhere i remember

1381
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,160
um they had to send a mammal saying you

1382
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,000
can bring your gun but you can't put it

1383
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,280
on top of your

1384
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,319
table it was it was insane it was insane

1385
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,359
um continue sorry

1386
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,160
no it was just like you the whole the

1387
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,640
whole

1388
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,880
team would just suddenly become

1389
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,839
laser focused on this attack and people

1390
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,400
would be

1391
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,280
watching that traffic stream and there

1392
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,400
was a

1393
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,960
there was a mitigation framework so in

1394
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,280
other words you're going to try a tool

1395
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,520
and if that tool doesn't respond you'll

1396
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,599
try another tool based on what

1397
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,319
you're seeing based on what kind of

1398
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,400
traffic it is and what kind of behavior

1399
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,200
it is

1400
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,599
and uh it was just like i mean

1401
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,000
probably like the most addicting video

1402
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,839
game you've ever seen in your life

1403
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,400
yeah though but you know everybody in

1404
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,800
the whole company would be there and

1405
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,480
some of these attacks would go on for

1406
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,440
days

1407
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,119
so so literally one shift would

1408
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,119
your the shift is getting ready to go

1409
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,720
off shift so that

1410
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,119
the next shift comes an hour before so

1411
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,640
that they can

1412
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,000
see what you're doing and transition off

1413
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,119
smoothly

1414
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,200
and move your duties to that oncoming

1415
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,200
person with no

1416
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,800
no bump no hiccup whatsoever and then

1417
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,520
you know as it went on people might be

1418
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,359
sleeping on a couch in the corner

1419
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,160
they might be sleeping on the floor they

1420
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,280
might be

1421
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,440
at the coffee machine pressing on the

1422
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,800
button that says

1423
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,160
like jet fuel um and

1424
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,680
and it was just a it was like probably

1425
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,000
the greatest

1426
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,079
experience of teamwork and and

1427
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:54,319
single-minded

1428
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,240
effort to a cause that i think most any

1429
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,319
of us experienced and

1430
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,880
you you can't go through that and not

1431
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,160
come out on the other

1432
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,839
side it was like you know

1433
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,280
my my family of um you know

1434
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,280
there were three girls and 97 brothers

1435
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,119
and it was 24 7 operations

1436
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,920
and and the reason i said it it you know

1437
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,520
it reminded me of the movie is because

1438
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,079
that

1439
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,800
that was actually what led into the

1440
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,680
concept of

1441
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,800
mr robot so um

1442
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,000
there's there's um youtube if you go

1443
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,400
look

1444
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,520
you you know for uh mr robot prolexic

1445
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,440
there's actually lines in mr robot that

1446
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,800
say culprolexic

1447
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,839
right right

1448
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,640
no way that was i believe it was episode

1449
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,759
number one that that happened

1450
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,920
yeah just a tail off of what rod and

1451
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,000
patrice are saying uh as somebody who

1452
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,359
sat on the front lines of a lot of those

1453
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,319
attacks

1454
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,200
uh there was probably no better place to

1455
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,400
cut your teeth on

1456
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,520
incident handling you were

1457
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,079
very quickly a grizzled veteran of being

1458
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,280
able to

1459
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,760
hold down be calm under a really

1460
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,680
rocky situation

1461
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,599
and the way that the teams you know

1462
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,880
escalated to each other

1463
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,119
helped each other hand off stuff was

1464
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,440
just like a masterpiece of artwork

1465
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,960
and i'm not just talking about the sock

1466
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,280
teams like handing off to the

1467
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,559
networking folks hanging out to the

1468
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,480
system folks and then further down the

1469
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,319
line handing off to the team

1470
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,839
that rod worked on which was a cert team

1471
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,240
for doing research for finding out

1472
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,160
you know who were these people what was

1473
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,160
their mo what tools were they using why

1474
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,359
were they doing this in the first

1475
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:37,920
place

1476
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,760
and then writing a kick-ass piece on it

1477
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,359
and then or

1478
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,880
even going the distance and busting

1479
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,720
their botnet wide open and taking it

1480
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,359
over and

1481
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,440
you know doing fun stuff like that that

1482
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,880
was always a great time

1483
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,079
so absolutely i could say like uh

1484
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,160
to add to position's comment so you

1485
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,440
asked like for something that's out of

1486
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,240
the movie

1487
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,079
our company actually created something

1488
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,760
that then came after

1489
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,440
which was on the tv show which was mr

1490
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,280
robot right

1491
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,480
i agree so guns uh loud

1492
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,119
what are smoking i

1493
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,000
because you really don't care about

1494
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,680
prolific you have a

1495
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,000
akamai and all those other ones so so

1496
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,800
yes

1497
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,559
yeah whatever happened to prolexic

1498
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,559
we're gonna leave it we're gonna leave

1499
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,839
it as it

1500
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,680
relaxing was fine

1501
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,799
i withdraw my question

1502
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,440
drop him in the cat chat if you have

1503
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,599
them yeah this is all before we wear a

1504
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:48,640
choir

1505
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,040
once we wear a choir let me just put it

1506
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,240
this way they're fun stuff

1507
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
it was a different organization after

1508
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,920
that right

1509
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,839
absolutely all right so

1510
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:06,400
he's from that why sorry

1511
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,520
no no movies from akamai not really

1512
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,760
no but you know what now that you're

1513
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,839
saying about burlex

1514
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,680
one of the great things about prolex is

1515
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,319
prolexa would invest in you

1516
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,200
alexa was was not a company that they

1517
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,400
knew because ddos was very specific

1518
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,640
and there were not such an industry back

1519
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,240
then that they had to train your number

1520
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:28,960
one

1521
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,280
two they were they had the hacker

1522
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,440
mentality they allowed people

1523
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,960
you didn't have to have a bachelor's

1524
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,880
degree you didn't have to have a

1525
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,640
a master's degree you didn't have to

1526
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,040
have sense certifications they will say

1527
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,000
we'll take you we'll train you and those

1528
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,559
were the

1529
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,760
the best people i have ever worked

1530
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,599
in the industry period um so that

1531
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,000
and then will invest on you like okay

1532
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,280
you want to go to sans

1533
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,760
listen what company sense what was it 60

1534
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,480
80 people

1535
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,839
do what i say and they will put us all

1536
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,040
together in a hotel yeah

1537
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,799
it was it was incredible the things they

1538
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,319
did for us the the

1539
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,680
that and that sort of

1540
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,520
encouraged you you know like patrice

1541
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,839
just said it it was a family and it

1542
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,119
wasn't 24

1543
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,319
7 because the sock was there and it was

1544
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,520
one first chip second shift and so on we

1545
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,359
even had coaches we were going to sleep

1546
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,559
there was food

1547
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,640
it was it was almost like i felt

1548
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,599
sometimes like

1549
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,200
it was the weekend i'm like let me

1550
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,040

1551
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,799
going on anything good or

1552
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,559
what's what's happening it was it was

1553
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,240
amazing that was the best job ever for

1554
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,599
me

1555
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,839
i think that was i think that was the

1556
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,640
only job that i've ever been at where

1557
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,400
on some of my off days i would think

1558
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,240
about what was going on at work

1559
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,599
right i'm exactly wow and to ryan's

1560
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,160
point when you started work there

1561
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,480
they said let us know which two

1562
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,640
conferences you're going to be attending

1563
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,000
it wasn't even a question you that was

1564
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,200
part of what you did

1565
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,839
was say i'm gonna i'm gonna attend this

1566
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,200
and i'm gonna learn that

1567
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,520
it was just accepted as part of the

1568
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,960
policy you

1569
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,480
i've never in i've worked for extremely

1570
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,480
large organizations with a whole lot

1571
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,160
more money

1572
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,119
that never made that kind of an offer to

1573
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,559
put that sort of investment

1574
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,000
into their people in that way right

1575
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,160
right so there was a there was an entire

1576
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,079
shift sorry one more thing just

1577
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,920
like just to piggyback off the investing

1578
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,760
in the people there was an entire shift

1579
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,240
dedicated to doing a training so you'd

1580
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,280
come to work

1581
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,119
uh and you'd have training and it wasn't

1582
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,720
i'm not talking about like

1583
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,480
oh your security awareness training

1584
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,760
where you don't click on the stupid

1585
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,839
email or you you know you'd have tech

1586
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,359
really really technical folks that would

1587
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,960
come in the room and they'd break you

1588
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,839
down on some really

1589
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,359
awesome technical stuff about what was

1590
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:50,960
going on in the company and some

1591
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,240
technology either that they were

1592
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,319
interested in using or currently using

1593
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,200
the environment

1594
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,240
and teach you all this stuff

1595
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,079
that's awesome so as a follow-up i wanna

1596
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:02,960
know

1597
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,720
it sounds like two parts right one

1598
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,760
would you recommend being in a sock for

1599
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,799
anyone um regardless of what vertical

1600
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:13,599
they end up in

1601
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,079
in cyber security um in you know as

1602
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:16,799
their early

1603
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,240
career move um two um

1604
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,680
would you say and this is again for the

1605
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,839
entire panel

1606
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,160
how would you say that you were able to

1607
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,520
cull through

1608
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,839
all of these different interesting um

1609
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,799
i guess specializations because i see

1610
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:35,280
that

1611
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,720
you know each of you have ended up in

1612
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,280
your own spaces uh compliance

1613
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,160
cloud uh research and you're all

1614
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,280
principles

1615
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,920
right how did that journey happen for

1616
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,559
you

1617
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,599
so that's a two part

1618
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,799
i can i can get it started if you want

1619
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,160
um prolexa was very open right

1620
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,920
but they wanted you like for example

1621
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,240
if you were gonna be a security engineer

1622
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,920
you had to go to the

1623
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,599
the sock by the way which by the way

1624
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,599
that was great i never worked at this

1625
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:10,880
sock directly

1626
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,559
but i had to shadow a guy for a week

1627
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,280
and then they would send me to watch

1628
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,319
what they were doing during the

1629
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,440
campaigns

1630
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,240
that it was like this is our business

1631
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,200
you need to know it

1632
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,760
and not only that sometimes depending on

1633
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,760
who you were you have a chance to go to

1634
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,520
certain departments of others remember

1635
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,040
it was a

1636
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,440
small company right it was uh we were

1637
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
132 at one point

1638
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,920
and regarding of how for example i

1639
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,440
picked up where to go

1640
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,640
i you know just like you guys some of

1641
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,160
you guys are approaching sometimes i

1642
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,839
want to do pen testing i wanted to do

1643
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,520
now so that's how i

1644
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
sort of uh started directing at one

1645
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,119
point i said it done enough

1646
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,000
i was probably next for me i said maybe

1647
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,559
he would do

1648
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,720
uh research right

1649
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,079
and and to tag on to what rod said i

1650
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,359
i also did not sit in the sock

1651
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,559
um but but it was a similar scenario

1652
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,240
um in in a compliance position

1653
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,520
i needed to be able to understand the

1654
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,720
product

1655
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,760
and to verbalize two

1656
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,880
prolexic customers how

1657
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,359
that product was going to allow them to

1658
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,000
comply

1659
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,599
to payment card industry standards

1660
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,280
iso standards whatever so

1661
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,079
while i i didn't have that experience of

1662
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,760
sitting in the chair

1663
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,200
doing you know looking at the screens

1664
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,559
being my primary job i still had to

1665
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,720
understand what was going on and know

1666
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,200
know what it meant and understand how

1667
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,920
that was going to impact customers

1668
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,359
um so i i would say that

1669
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,720
um sitting in the sock per se

1670
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,839
may not be necessary

1671
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,839
but having the understanding is

1672
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,599
definitely necessary

1673
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,040
and having that

1674
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,880
kind of characteristic um you know to to

1675
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,520
be a detail-oriented person to

1676
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,200
to learn those technical things

1677
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,240
um you need to you need to want to do

1678
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,760
that that needs to be the kind of thing

1679
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,839
that you're interested in doing

1680
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,520
um and and moving forward having gone

1681
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,200
you know beyond prolexic um i find that

1682
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,400
now uh what i do

1683
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,200
is a lot of i guess you would maybe sort

1684
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,040
of call it compliance architecture

1685
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,720
creating solutions

1686
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,359
um that allow an organization to become

1687
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,040
compliant

1688
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,240
from whatever it is they have which

1689
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,359
might not be much um and you can't

1690
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,720
always

1691
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,799
give you know i mean it's great if you

1692
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,960
work for all the big organizations and

1693
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,319
you have all the money

1694
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,839
but that's not the reality for a lot of

1695
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,240
people

1696
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,599
and so how creative you can get to

1697
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,280
create a solution that

1698
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,319
meets their needs um

1699
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,799
with what they have or with what they

1700
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,559
can put into it

1701
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,680
is is pretty important so you you

1702
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,359
you build on that um

1703
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,039
those characteristics of of how creative

1704
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,039
you can get and how you understand what

1705
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,000
they're doing

1706
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,920
even if you didn't sit in the sock if

1707
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,839
you have those characteristics it gives

1708
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,920
you what you need to move forward

1709
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,160
ace is the one who did actually sit in

1710
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,680
the sock what do you

1711
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,960
what are your inputs i just want to say

1712
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,000
real quick

1713
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,720
uh so patrice sat on like a cubicle unit

1714
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,400
that was like just behind the sock we

1715
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,839
had a pretty open space

1716
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,880
in the in prolexic um and a lot of the

1717
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,240
teams got to kind of

1718
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,000
uh like i think rod mentioned we kind of

1719
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,160
you know would walk over to another area

1720
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,359
and say hey are you working on this or

1721
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,559
whatever's going on so there was a lot

1722
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,400
of kind of cross-training and crosstalk

1723
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,599
i just want to say one thing like

1724
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,599
watching patrice work at what she did

1725
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,079
is badass uh patrice is an absolute

1726
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,760
badass when it comes to her job

1727
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,079
and like i respect patrice so much for

1728
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,200
what she did

1729
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,359
and uh moving forward in my career

1730
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,880
whenever i had been assigned

1731
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,920
any type of compliance tasks or uh

1732
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,400
if i ever had to like uh champion a

1733
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,000
compliance effort for some

1734
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,200
whatever product or

1735
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,280
team that i was on i always look back

1736
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,880
very finely on the way that patrice have

1737
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,079
a situation and i

1738
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,160
use that as a way to uh kind of get

1739
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,280
through that stuff

1740
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,200
so thank you very much patrice and

1741
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,119
you're awesome by the way

1742
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,760
um going back to the discussion on do

1743
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,280
you think it's uh relevant or do you

1744
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,799
think it's a good way to cut your teeth

1745
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,400
uh starting your cyber security career

1746
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,960
in a sock um i definitely think so

1747
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,079
i definitely think uh so in

1748
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,400
in our sock it was like like uh rod

1749
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,240
mentioned is a very niche

1750
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,319
uh type of technology that we're or not

1751
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,240
even a technology a methodology of

1752
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:02,799
blocking

1753
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,039
uh ddos attacks which you know you

1754
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,240
didn't really like

1755
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,920
have this type of this wasn't like a

1756
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,760
common thing stocks would

1757
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,319
mainly look at like malware they would

1758
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,359
look at you know

1759
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,720
vulnerabilities that were going on in

1760
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,559
their in their infrastructure and their

1761
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,599
environment

1762
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,920
and so being inside of a sock that was

1763
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,520
catered towards ddos was like a very

1764
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,640
unique perspective

1765
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,240
what was very interesting about it too

1766
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,000
was that we had we dealt with every

1767
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,760
single vertical of industry

1768
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,319
so whether that be financial industry uh

1769
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:31,760
e-commerce site

1770
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,039
uh uh porn sign gaming side

1771
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,520
whatever site we had we definitely saw

1772
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,480
the entire

1773
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,079
breadth of uh industries uh using that

1774
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,440
technology and being protected

1775
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,359
by that technology so if i would say one

1776
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,799
thing that i would that would stick out

1777
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,520
to me is like

1778
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,760
if you get an opportunity to work in a

1779
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,599
sock that has multiple industries that

1780
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:52,720
it protects

1781
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,400
i'd say that that's a really awesome

1782
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,960
opportunity because you will get the

1783
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,920
uh experience and understanding of when

1784
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,359
you move further on in your

1785
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,160
career uh you know how you kind of work

1786
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,440
through these different organizations

1787
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,400
and how they

1788
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,039
think about how they need security uh

1789
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,319
working with a bank is

1790
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,920
vastly different than working with

1791
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,400
somebody who runs a social media site

1792
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,680
uh in the way that they think about

1793
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,760
security so um

1794
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,359
absolutely and to add and to add a

1795
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,799
little bit more on that

1796
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,799
um and that's why by the way everybody

1797
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:30,160
that was there in that in that company

1798
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,200
has gone to everywhere everywhere

1799
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,799
facebook google cloudflare you name it

1800
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,440
because those people and this comes

1801
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,280
alluding sort of the question that roger

1802
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,039
just asked in the in the

1803
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,319
in the um the chat is

1804
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:49,599
because we were defending people some

1805
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,680
industries that were like listen you

1806
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,839
want to see the the newest the latest

1807
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,119
and the baddest attacks

1808
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,839
protect the casino the casinos get hit

1809
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:58,160
by

1810
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,680
everything 24 7. and the other one

1811
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,400
unfortunately

1812
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,200
is the cam people so i have to assume

1813
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,960
the only fans will be

1814
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,400
incredibly uh uh difficult to defend

1815
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,599
because they get

1816
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,119
i don't know what's going on with those

1817
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,799
campsites dude but

1818
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,039
it's like they try to take him down

1819
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,960
attacking everywhere

1820
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,200
uh so the examples of things like that

1821
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,039
then we had to protect we protected by

1822
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,559
the way

1823
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,960
eight of the top ten banks in the united

1824
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,599
states

1825
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,640
um and that's also why a competitor

1826
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,520
decides to acquire us that's that's

1827
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
basically what happened a competitor

1828
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,520
which we were taking

1829
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,559
basically clients from them and then

1830
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,559
they got upset and they had their cash

1831
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,760
and they took us over

1832
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,319
that's basically what happened and and

1833
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:46,799
and

1834
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,160
um and then well the rest is history but

1835
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,920
what what um what a says is

1836
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,160
is very true the diversity of things

1837
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,920
that we had to protect uh

1838
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,400
uh it was you had to learn the nature of

1839
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,760
the business you had to

1840
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,480
to understand the business logic uh and

1841
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
we were protecting people that quite

1842
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,319
frankly needed to be protected so

1843
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,520
yeah the the um the really

1844
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,440
like the best folks that i ever worked

1845
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,119
with and the sort of the best mentoring

1846
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,480
that i got out of there

1847
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,440
um kind of all boils down to this one

1848
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,720
quote that i very

1849
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,039
uh you know come back to all the time

1850
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:26,079
and i think of

1851
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,480
which is uh good engineers check the

1852
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,359
site

1853
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,920
and what that means is that you have an

1854
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
intimate knowledge of what your

1855
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,559
the person you're protecting uh does

1856
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:37,119
from uh

1857
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,440
from like like rod said a business logic

1858
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,440
flow and then you also

1859
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,440
are very intimate you know what's going

1860
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,680
on with uh with their site and you're

1861
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,720
checking their site

1862
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,559
you're not just going to their home page

1863
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,240
and checking oh is their website up like

1864
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,039
no no

1865
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,119
create an account on their site log into

1866
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,559
the site click on some of the features

1867
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,000
do some of the things those are the best

1868
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,280
engineers those were the people that

1869
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,319
really knew what the hell they were

1870
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,000
doing and could protect

1871
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,039
a to z that's

1872
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,160
excellent advice that's excellent advice

1873
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,240
um okay guys so i'm gonna go into the

1874
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,440
next question and

1875
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,039
this again is going to be an all panel

1876
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,359
question everybody can go ahead

1877
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,080
um roger asks when interviewing security

1878
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,158
folks particularly those without degrees

1879
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,479
certs etc how do you test for the

1880
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,560
intangible qualities that

1881
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,920
matter the most so persistence problem

1882
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,880
solving

1883
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,439
passion do you start off asking them

1884
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,880
where they get their news

1885
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,319
i'm going to go ahead this time and

1886
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,040
start with patrice

1887
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,080
the white thing um part of that is

1888
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,920
is uh if it's just in the context of an

1889
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,198
interview

1890
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,120
um you're you're gonna have to ask them

1891
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,319
a question that is

1892
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,238
that is um based on a scenario

1893
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,439
give them a scenario in which they would

1894
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,560
come you know come under fire or

1895
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,640
which they would have some sort of an

1896
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,679
obstacle

1897
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,640
and and see if what their what they're

1898
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,799
responding to you is in line with what

1899
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,799
it is that you're expecting

1900
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,279
um that's one of the things that i i

1901
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,799
find for myself

1902
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,799
um a huge part of what i do because

1903
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,080
let's face it no

1904
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,880
no i am never the compliance people are

1905
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,799
never the first

1906
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,640
people you put on the list to invite to

1907
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,920
your party we're

1908
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,180
not a fun crowd you know

1909
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,158
[Music]

1910
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:31,040
we're always the ones

1911
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,960
they didn't get the memo right they

1912
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,920
don't uh

1913
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,759
you know you're only pretty much for

1914
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,759
what i represent you're gonna have to do

1915
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,080
work and spend money and so you know

1916
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,839
when when you walk in the door people

1917
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,759
are like oh man

1918
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,359
so persistence is probably

1919
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,880
um you know the the question was what

1920
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,439
about

1921
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,199
what about certifications certifications

1922
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,480
get you in the door

1923
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,600
persistence keeps you in the job and

1924
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,120
a large part of what i do is

1925
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,480
continue to press for whatever

1926
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,679
objective needs to be accomplished and

1927
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,320
um one of the things i would definitely

1928
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,360
say in that

1929
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,040
is um look for like when you ask that

1930
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,719
question

1931
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,080
try to evaluate the creativity

1932
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,600
one of the things i would say if

1933
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,040
somebody gives you only one answer

1934
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,199
you probably don't want somebody that

1935
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,719
has only one

1936
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,679
tool in their you know in their tool

1937
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,040
belt

1938
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,040
so if somebody is thinking and being

1939
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,800
creative

1940
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,000
and my day-to-day experience is uh

1941
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,920
you know a handyman that shows up with

1942
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,360
only a hammer

1943
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,600
he's only going to help you do a very

1944
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,440
small

1945
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,239
you know task so you have to have a lot

1946
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,440
of tools

1947
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,760
hopefully as you speak to someone in an

1948
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,800
interview

1949
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,840
you can get an idea how creative they

1950
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,719
are

1951
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,360
and what they could do to think of other

1952
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:05,920
tools

1953
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,480
sometimes just bulldozing your way

1954
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,000
through something

1955
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,760
is helpful if if everything else is in

1956
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,640
place and they

1957
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,800
just need someone to keep things moving

1958
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,679
forward

1959
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,880
but sometimes being a bulldozer is not

1960
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,040
the way to get the job done sometimes

1961
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,120
you have to have some finesse and

1962
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,199
make people understand what the value is

1963
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,280
to them and sell them on it and so you

1964
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,560
have to have other

1965
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,440
tools so i will i would do that i would

1966
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,440
give them a scenario and then see how

1967
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,199
creative they can get with what tools

1968
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,040
they could work with

1969
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,640
okay and then thank you so much for that

1970
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,880
um would you like to tell us like what

1971
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,159
your opinion would be on that

1972
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,760
what do you look for in potential

1973
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,440
candidates

1974
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,320
yeah absolutely uh in the past like year

1975
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
or so i've done quite a plethora of

1976
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,040
interviews

1977
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,760
actually and the interviews have ranged

1978
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,640
from

1979
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,159
all different types of positions from

1980
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,920
software development engineers to

1981
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,640
security folks to project managers

1982
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,480
and i usually will try to uh cater the

1983
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,239
cater the interview as best of my

1984
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,679
ability to

1985
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,280
whatever strength we're trying to pull

1986
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,199
out of that um

1987
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,520
candidate uh one interesting thing that

1988
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,960
i get thrown on a lot

1989
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,440
is i usually get the very technical

1990
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,480
portion of the interview

1991
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,480
uh they kind of they'll wind me up and

1992
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,440
they'll throw me in there and they'll

1993
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,800
say just hit him with all the nasty

1994
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,080
technical stuff that you can hit him

1995
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,560
with

1996
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,840
and i don't always think that that's a

1997
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,239
fair uh assessment or judgment of a

1998
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:32,880
candidate

1999
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,159
to just try to hit him with a bunch of

2000
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,840
technical questions like oh what is this

2001
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,679
specific directory on a linux system

2002
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,040
well give me two seconds and you can

2003
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,320
google it that's not what we're trying

2004
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,679
to evaluate here

2005
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,880
um i myself came from a place of having

2006
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,800
uh pretty much self-taught myself to get

2007
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,000
into the industry

2008
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,480
um and i did go to college but i didn't

2009
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,120
go for

2010
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,679
a computer science degree um and a lot

2011
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,360
of the folks that i worked with

2012
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,600
uh did not even necessarily come from

2013
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,880
that space either

2014
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,640
some of the most like brilliant people

2015
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,080
that i've met just

2016
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,400
either have self-taught themselves or

2017
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,840
have been just passionate enough about

2018
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,440
whatever they're doing to get into it

2019
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,199
and just figure it out themselves

2020
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,360
so i think like patrice definitely uh

2021
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,719
brings out a good point

2022
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,640
is um i love to i love to bring up

2023
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,400
scenarios and i love to keep driving on

2024
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,360
the scenario

2025
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,600
so if somebody comes in there and i say

2026
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,199
hey how do i solve this problem and they

2027
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,520
approach it with like this one tool

2028
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,040
then i'll double down on that question

2029
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,320
i'll say all right cool you solved it

2030
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,199
with this tool

2031
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,400
tell me how you would solve it if you

2032
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,920
didn't even have that tool what would

2033
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,520
you do in that scenario

2034
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,679
um you know that's like a that's like a

2035
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,840
pretty good uh follow-up question

2036
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
i also sometimes will like help my

2037
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,440
candidates along if they're struggling a

2038
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,000
little bit

2039
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,360
and i'll say oh you know maybe there's

2040
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,719
this thing that you could use or you

2041
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,880
already told me about this ideology

2042
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,960
uh how would you further bring out that

2043
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,560
point and flesh that out a little bit

2044
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,040
more

2045
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,480
you know so um

2046
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,080
another thing that i like to do is like

2047
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,600
if somebody

2048
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,520
uh claims that they don't have like

2049
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,440
either a certification or they're like

2050
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,800
in school or they haven't had quite the

2051
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,880
education uh what does your home lab

2052
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,600
look like

2053
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,120
what are some things that you've done to

2054
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,679
help your uh to help your parents or

2055
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,440
the people in your lives ask you for it

2056
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,040
work uh

2057
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,560
you know if it's a if it's a position

2058
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,560
for incident handling tell me about a

2059
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,080
challenging time that you've been

2060
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,480
through

2061
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,840
and how did you handle each one of the

2062
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,600
steps and talk to me through the entire

2063
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,040
process and how you completed that

2064
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,679
process

2065
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,440
what was the outcome and did you sit

2066
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,640
down afterwards and what was the

2067
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,080
post-mortem and what did you learn from

2068
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,719
all that stuff

2069
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,080
so those are like the types of questions

2070
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,280
that i'll try to get into and have

2071
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,320
people think about

2072
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,760
and really there you can dissect

2073
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,679
somebody's like critical thinking skills

2074
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,360
uh you can see if they have the passion

2075
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,880
very easily when you talk about like a

2076
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,320
home lab or you talk about

2077
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,320
uh interest in the community uh i was

2078
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,520
doing an interview last week and

2079
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,880
somebody brought up a piece of

2080
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,199
uh a piece of security news that i had

2081
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,199
read that very morning and i was like oh

2082
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:47,840
man

2083
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,280
kudos for bringing that up because

2084
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,960
that's awesome um

2085
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,239
whenever you're doing an interview no

2086
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:53,600
matter what i think you should

2087
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,360
definitely always do your research on

2088
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,800
the company that you're getting ready to

2089
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,760
interview for

2090
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,440
and the biggest key thing that i think

2091
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,800
when it comes to interviews is you have

2092
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,760
to keep this one

2093
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,000
this one bit of crucial advice in mind

2094
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,600
when you're interviewing a person is

2095
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,120
finding out about you if you're a right

2096
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,320
fit for their company

2097
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,239
you're also finding out if that company

2098
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,600
is a right fit for you

2099
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,120
so you need to ask those questions and

2100
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,239
think about those things when you're

2101
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,400
going into the company as well

2102
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,600
hey one advice says like amazing advice

2103
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,280
um rod what about you what do you

2104
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,360
look for when it or i'm sorry how do you

2105
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,040
assess that in your candidates

2106
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,320
well um i agree with both of them

2107
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,000
uh we did basically um

2108
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,199
we at least this is what i learned

2109
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,239
right i i had i had interviewed all

2110
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,120
kinds of people

2111
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,120
from phds to i had nothing to show for

2112
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,760
but i just came out of the military uh

2113
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,400
my best two people one was an ex-marine

2114
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,760
the um he

2115
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,040
um basically

2116
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,920
couldn't afford anything in just like

2117
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,719
video games

2118
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,840
and he'd learn how to crack them

2119
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,360
and i saw him playing my catcher the

2120
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,800
flags ace knows what i'm talking about

2121
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,000
and this kid was a wizard uh i actually

2122
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,840
had to basically sort of stick my neck

2123
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,600
out for him to get higher

2124
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,600
because i didn't believe that he had no

2125
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,040
experience had nothing

2126
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,239
and then my other great hire

2127
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,320
which is still at that company is a

2128
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,840
dropout

2129
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,000
from arts it wasn't even computer

2130
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,199
science

2131
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:33,280
and he was working on the a adult

2132
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,800
uh media uh

2133
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,480
industry and nobody wanted to give it a

2134
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,159
chance either and

2135
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,880
uh and i said this guy's amazing i i

2136
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,320
trust that he's gonna do well he did

2137
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,239
amazing so

2138
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,280
it's i you had to i would say this you

2139
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:49,760
can't

2140
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,080
just turn down somebody because they

2141
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,120
have a

2142
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,159
different background or because or

2143
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,679
because they don't have a master's

2144
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,159
degree

2145
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,159
you know i had one time to hire a person

2146
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,000
with a very high end degree

2147
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,239
and i got in trouble because the person

2148
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,360
did not perform

2149
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,480
and that reflected badly on me

2150
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,280
um so what i usually what i used to do

2151
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:11,679
is

2152
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,440
basically some of the things that ace

2153
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,960
just said i

2154
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,280
i at one point i realized too i you will

2155
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,360
get sometimes i will get people that

2156
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,719
will come from certain government

2157
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,640
agencies and said i can't show you this

2158
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,000
because it's classified

2159
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,040
right uh i later discovered that this

2160
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,360
that's a way to skid a question

2161
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,080
basically

2162
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,000
so what i try to do i used to have a um

2163
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,239
a capture the flag basically i would

2164
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,360
give them for example

2165
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,320
a a simple i wasn't easy even giving

2166
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,679
them like like a big deal

2167
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:42,960
i was giving them for example i would

2168
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,800
give them a web app

2169
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,400
which had all watched up then for

2170
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,080
example or i would get in a binary they

2171
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,320
didn't have certain protections that

2172
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,000
even if you didn't break it but if you

2173
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,520
were able to crash it and tell me how

2174
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,800
you did it and said okay you have an

2175
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,400
idea what you're trying to do

2176
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,719
um i would say you need to have more on

2177
01:17:58,719 --> 01:17:59,520
skills

2178
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,560
and potential than that uh then

2179
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,520
background uh

2180
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,640
if you hire somebody just on educational

2181
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,239
background and you don't test

2182
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,400
you you risk what happened to me which

2183
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,679
is i i said

2184
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,600
oh you got this all this and this and

2185
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,679
then i gave them a binary

2186
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:16,800
and they said well you want me to do

2187
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,800
with this and that's what i knew that i

2188
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,960
was in serious trouble

2189
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,360
so so you got to be careful you want to

2190
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,880
be careful when you bring

2191
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,760
when you hire people just expecting for

2192
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,320
them to

2193
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,760
to to perform based on paper you want it

2194
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,360
you want to try to do your

2195
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,640
a little more dynamic uh scenarios

2196
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,440
uh like a said are they thinking outside

2197
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,719
the box what do they do

2198
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,199
in their free time are they for example

2199
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,040
going into

2200
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,840
uh groups like for example in our case

2201
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,760
uh we've added a lot of people by hack

2202
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,400
miami

2203
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,800
because we knew who was who and we we

2204
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,640
were constantly playing

2205
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,320
capture the flags and windows and we

2206
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,400
knew okay this guy knows so by the time

2207
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,440
you were to

2208
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,400
do the uh to the interview you sort of

2209
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:02,800
uh

2210
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,679
we also sort of knew if you were gonna

2211
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,040
be good or not

2212
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,480
and uh also i used to do uh some of the

2213
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,840
the other stuff that

2214
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,320
roger was asking uh we used to do the

2215
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,760
what we call the beer test

2216
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,159
the beer test is basically you go out

2217
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,679
with the whole team

2218
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,920
and you forget about work and you just

2219
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,719
have

2220
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,000
lunch and drink a beer and the question

2221
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,600
that the team needs to answer

2222
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,400
is can i talk to this guy outside work

2223
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,400
if your answer is this guy is a genius

2224
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,440
but he's a jerk

2225
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,719
we can't hide him the genius jerks will

2226
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,159
destroy your team

2227
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,199
unfortunately right they may they may do

2228
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,520
great at times and they may they may be

2229
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,360
amazing but if you're trying to build a

2230
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,159
team

2231
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:52,320
it usually bring seller out of of of uh

2232
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,239
back and forth and eventually some of

2233
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,760
your good people will say i can't work

2234
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,440
with this guy i had to leave so the

2235
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,800
teens a lot of times are

2236
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,320
a lot of uh soft skills

2237
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,400
right which is sort of what roger was

2238
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,760
alluding to uh

2239
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,880
and for for kyle who was asking uh how

2240
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,320
do

2241
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,320
you have interest in the in the industry

2242
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,760
like uh a said

2243
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,840
he's self-taught i was self-taught too

2244
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,520
uh how did i

2245
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,760
learn i look at groups like this i went

2246
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,040
to conferences

2247
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,040
i went on twitter and then when i went

2248
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,960
to twitter somebody said hey

2249
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,600
there is this vulnerability in windows i

2250
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,880
will build my own

2251
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,280
lab i will test that vulnerability and

2252
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,080
little by little

2253
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,320
i started meeting people reading books

2254
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,000
networking and eventually that's how i

2255
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,719
was able to do it

2256
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,280
and if i could just tack onto what rod

2257
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,719
said that's really

2258
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,159
important um don't don't be

2259
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:50,000
afraid to create where there isn't

2260
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,679
something already

2261
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,719
i can tell you for what i do

2262
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,159
um i i have degrees

2263
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,199
i have college degrees

2264
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,760
they're not for what i for what my job

2265
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,639
is there

2266
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,320
there is no college course of study that

2267
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,440
you can take

2268
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,560
to get a degree for what it is i'm doing

2269
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,159
day to day

2270
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:18,400
um so you have to keep in mind

2271
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,800
that if if it's what you want to do

2272
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,280
you may need to create the path it may

2273
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,480
not be there for you

2274
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,600
so you have to have that in you to be

2275
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,560
willing to do that

2276
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,800
that's a hacker mentality yeah

2277
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,719
just uh just to chime in i hope

2278
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:43,440
that that is not to say that collect

2279
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,480
degrees are not

2280
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,199
important because even though it may not

2281
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,080
be

2282
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,960
directly related it does help when you

2283
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,280
see

2284
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,760
someone communicating through email or

2285
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,560
report

2286
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,440
you know this person is refined in the

2287
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,639
way they write also

2288
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,000
when they have collect degrees

2289
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,800
i agree with that and i i can definitely

2290
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,840
say

2291
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,400
um i i personally kind of subscribe to

2292
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,880
the theory that when you

2293
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,239
are getting a job um that

2294
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,239
initial discussion that you're gonna

2295
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,639
have with your employer

2296
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,400
is in many cases gonna peg you to where

2297
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,159
you're gonna work from

2298
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,520
forevermore there um so you

2299
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,520
you need to be on top of your game

2300
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,840
when you have that discussion about what

2301
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,520
money you're gonna make and what you're

2302
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:35,920
gonna

2303
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,040
do and what you're gonna get so

2304
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,320
having the degrees definitely gives you

2305
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,560
kind of an automatic step up i i can

2306
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,520
certainly say

2307
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,120
that for my salary level

2308
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,239
there's a certain amount of discussion

2309
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,239
that in general does not have to happen

2310
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,760
because of the degrees

2311
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,400
um like rod said he hired somebody with

2312
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,920
a master's degree

2313
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,719
so there's a certain amount of kind of

2314
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:03,760
default

2315
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,280
give in that case um

2316
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,600
so there there is some value to the

2317
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,199
degrees certainly

2318
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,280
but again to his point if you come in

2319
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,880
and then don't perform to

2320
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,080
that level um your degree is not going

2321
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,080
to save you in that case

2322
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,600
it's a rough i think credentials i agree

2323
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,719
well it's one has to perform because i

2324
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,280
one other positive thing before i take

2325
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,880
up so much time

2326
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,280
about a degree you know that if someone

2327
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,360
could go up to a master's level or phd

2328
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,320
level

2329
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,480
it shows that if they can actually get

2330
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,760
it they must

2331
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,880
display perseverance to actually be able

2332
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,760
to

2333
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,360
get up to that level so that's one

2334
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,120
positive in their favor

2335
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,880
perhaps they don't have the technical

2336
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,520
know-how best for someone to get up to

2337
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,400
phd level it shows they must be patient

2338
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,040
and that's

2339
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,600
one quality we also need in this field

2340
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,320
patience and perseverance

2341
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,960
true yeah i definitely agree i was i was

2342
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,440
going to say

2343
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,600
on to that point what patrice was saying

2344
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,520
i don't i don't in any way diminish

2345
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,080
somebody

2346
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,280
that has a degree um i just think like

2347
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,239
on rod's point is that you know a

2348
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,000
credential will start me to have

2349
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,480
a conversation with you about something

2350
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,719
where i could already assume

2351
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,120
that you have pieces of knowledge that

2352
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,120
you should have based on your credential

2353
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,040
so if there's a master's degree i

2354
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,639
already have assumptions about things

2355
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,480
that you've done in your life

2356
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,960
but you still you do yourself with this

2357
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,679
justice

2358
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,000
if you're an interviewer and you don't

2359
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,760
still prod and poke at some of those

2360
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,679
things that they should have done there

2361
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,360
because that's when you get into a

2362
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,880
problem where you're like oh this guy

2363
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,159
has a doctorate so this guy has a

2364
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,000
master's degree in cyber security

2365
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,239
well what kind of technical ability has

2366
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,600
he actually touched what has he done

2367
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,679
like fine if you spent a couple days on

2368
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:52,880
metasploit whatever

2369
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,239
but if your job is going to be doing

2370
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,000
metasploit every single day and you

2371
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,840
barely know how to fire the thing up

2372
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,360
then that's going to be a problem

2373
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,719
so you need to know how to poke and

2374
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,120
profit those things based on somebody's

2375
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,080
credentials

2376
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,120
i agree um okay thank you so much guys

2377
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,360
um patrice you set me up for the um

2378
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,719
i don't even understand sports so well

2379
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,960
but the perfect uh pick and roll

2380
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,080
uh mentioning compensation and then rod

2381
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,920
also mentioned it earlier with the

2382
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,400
sunshine tax

2383
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,679
how do you ask for compensation how do

2384
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,040
you ask for what you're worth

2385
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,639
i think a lot of us um i i got lucky

2386
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:29,679
with this one thing

2387
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,520
yeah i got lucky with my internship now

2388
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,840
but i think a lot of us are so happy to

2389
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,639
have our

2390
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,120
first positions that we just take

2391
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,800
whatever comes to us and we're being

2392
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,000
grossly overpaid

2393
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,639
almost 100 of the time i think that

2394
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,719
everybody can say yes to that

2395
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,440
how do you ask for what you're worth i

2396
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,880
have a really good way to

2397
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,840
sit through that real quick um

2398
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,120
so in in major companies you are very

2399
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,040
highly discouraged from discussing

2400
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,880
your salary with other co-workers and

2401
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,239
colleagues uh

2402
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,159
 that like excuse my friends but

2403
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,760
 that talk to people

2404
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,120
the best thing that you can do for

2405
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,880
yourself in this industry and any

2406
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:09,920
industry

2407
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,199
is to interview regularly even if you're

2408
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,679
absolutely happy with your job because

2409
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,360
that will find out what your market

2410
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,600
worth is for another company and you may

2411
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,360
surprise yourself and find some other

2412
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,320
kick-ass gig

2413
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,600
that you weren't even expecting that

2414
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,400
you're gonna find and get into that gig

2415
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,560
um negotiation skills which are

2416
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,400
something that you will never learn in a

2417
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,719
cyber security college career course or

2418
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,360
any

2419
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,320
certification that you ever take soft

2420
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,080
skills are something that are definitely

2421
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,880
required

2422
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,960
uh rod mentioned earlier if you have a

2423
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,400
savant that has

2424
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,480
zero social skills or is a dick you

2425
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,840
don't want to work with that person it

2426
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,560
doesn't matter

2427
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,159
that person is not going to get the job

2428
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,000
or if they get the job it's because the

2429
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,520
interviewers didn't do proper due

2430
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,719
diligence

2431
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,080
so uh it's very important that you

2432
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,320
go to a lot of interviews you're gonna

2433
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,080
 up a lot in the beginning i promise

2434
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:00,480
you

2435
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,920
so if there is a place that you have

2436
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,480
that's your dream job do not go apply at

2437
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,199
that place

2438
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,800
for your first interview right

2439
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,719
exactly take a couple of chances to go

2440
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,159
to a bunch of different places and

2441
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:10,719
interview

2442
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,719
and learn what the process is learn the

2443
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,400
appropriate time that it's

2444
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,000
learn the appropriate time when you

2445
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,600
should have those discussions

2446
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,880
not only should you think about

2447
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,560
compensation and how much money you get

2448
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,199
paid

2449
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,520
but it's also about work-life balance

2450
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,120
it's also about things that are afforded

2451
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,239
to you in the position

2452
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,159
do you get to work remotely how do they

2453
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,920
handle you when you have a sick day

2454
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,000
do they offer you any amenities are

2455
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,440
there any perks for working at the

2456
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:33,920
company

2457
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,120
you got to think about total

2458
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,960
compensation as well so those are

2459
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,120
those are things that you will never

2460
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,639
learn by

2461
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,560
going to a cyber security course by

2462
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,080
learning how to break into a bank you'll

2463
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,520
never learn that like that

2464
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,080
you have to learn that through

2465
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,080
experience through education of you

2466
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,520
doing it on your own and figuring that

2467
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
 out

2468
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,280
and the only person who can determine

2469
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,920
the value of some of those things is you

2470
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,000
how much does it matter to you that you

2471
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,080
work from home maybe it doesn't maybe it

2472
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,280
does

2473
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,560
right right and one of the things to

2474
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,239
keep in mind too

2475
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,760
i i don't want to cut you off are you

2476
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,639
done i'm good yeah yeah

2477
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,000
okay one of the other things too um

2478
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,639
wait it i i saw one of the questions in

2479
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:19,199
the chat

2480
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,040
where's a good place to start boot camp

2481
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,199
self-study what programs

2482
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:27,280
um if you like for example i have a

2483
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,400
study group that i attend every week

2484
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,080
it's all tech professionals who

2485
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,679
are gainfully employed and we all have

2486
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,600
jobs we're not looking for jobs

2487
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,880
but somebody wrote a book a

2488
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,239
a couple months ago that had interesting

2489
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,239
stuff in there so we get together and we

2490
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,199
do that

2491
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,080
um we have everybody in that study group

2492
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:52,800
from people

2493
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,679
who have been in the industry for

2494
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,520
probably are past their retirement age

2495
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,120
to be quite honest

2496
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,880
um to to brand new people and

2497
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,880
if i wanted to know what any one of

2498
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,239
those made

2499
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,120
i could just ask them if i want to get a

2500
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,440
general idea what is the range of a sock

2501
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:11,920
one

2502
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,440
analyst they would tell me um if i

2503
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,840
if i go to a hack miami meeting i could

2504
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
go up to rod and say hey rod

2505
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,520
you know if i want to be a security

2506
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,880
researcher

2507
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,800
can you give me an idea what i'm going

2508
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,320
to make so

2509
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,400
um part of it is um hanging around those

2510
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,480
people making the connections with those

2511
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,520
people and if that's what you think you

2512
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,480
want to do

2513
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,480
then those are the people you should be

2514
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,239
seeking to get

2515
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,280
advice from anyway and to to hang out

2516
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,360
with and to learn from

2517
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,000
i i can say for myself being a

2518
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,560
compliance person

2519
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,960
when i first started going to the hack

2520
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,719
miami meetings

2521
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,679
um they were really technical most of

2522
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,679
the people there were

2523
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,840
employees of prolexic they were talking

2524
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,360
about ddos

2525
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,440
i didn't understand a lot of what they

2526
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,360
said many times

2527
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,239
i would just go and i would just write

2528
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:10,639
down

2529
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,400
five words that they said that might

2530
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,080
have been mandarin for what i could

2531
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:18,080
understand and go home and study it

2532
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,639
because then at least the next time they

2533
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,239
said those five words

2534
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,639
i could be conversing on it i might

2535
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,400
leave the next time with five

2536
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,600
more words but

2537
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,920
it took time but i was able to build up

2538
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,440
that vocabulary

2539
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,360
so um in terms of getting started in the

2540
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,320
industry

2541
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,960
and then where where that goes in terms

2542
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,239
of your worth

2543
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:45,040
um make friends with those people study

2544
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,920
groups usually are for free

2545
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,440
if you join the hack miami um channels

2546
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,520
they have uh all kinds of training

2547
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,719
resources

2548
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,920
some are free some are not um some of it

2549
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,760
may apply to you some may not but it's

2550
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,280
not gonna cost you anything to go in

2551
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,639
there and look

2552
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,080
um i find that a mix is good

2553
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,320
for self-study you know it's great if

2554
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,400
you can just pay a lot of money to

2555
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,639
to do whatever you want i i would love

2556
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,719
to have that problem

2557
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,960
um but for me some things are worth it

2558
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,719
um because i'm in a payment card

2559
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,280
industry there are certain

2560
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,000
certifications that really just speak

2561
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,480
you when you walk in the door with that

2562
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,600
certification

2563
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,840
you're on a completely different level

2564
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:32,800
um so

2565
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,320
so there are some things that are worth

2566
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,159
it in some things or not but

2567
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:39,440
um make friends with those people and

2568
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,320
learn that

2569
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,719
in terms of one of the other things that

2570
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,760
i wanted to tackle what a said is

2571
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,800
oh my god learn to communicate

2572
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,159
you know if you have great

2573
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:55,760
skills and you can't write a paper that

2574
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,760
anyone can read

2575
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,679
if you have mad skills and no one

2576
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,120
can read your email and come out of it

2577
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:05,679
knowing

2578
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,719
what it was you intended to say

2579
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,719
then then you have a problem so

2580
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,840
don't forget the skills that may not

2581
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,719
seem obvious

2582
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,040
technical skills are awesome but if you

2583
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,639
can't communicate

2584
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,679
what you meant then you don't

2585
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,199
appear to have value because you can't

2586
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:30,000
communicate what it is you're adding

2587
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,600
so um don't overlook

2588
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,760
don't overlook the you know i guess they

2589
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,960
call them soft skills but to me

2590
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,000
that's your presentation of yourself so

2591
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,159
don't overlook how it is that you state

2592
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,199
yourself

2593
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:49,360
um my my um recommendation for an

2594
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,080
interview

2595
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,760
i mean you need to be confident to me

2596
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,800
confidence and firmness is one thing

2597
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,400
um mean cocky is different

2598
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,199
uh and i and i think the cocky thing

2599
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,199
doesn't sell very well

2600
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:08,800
um so keep in mind you know

2601
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,880
maybe you're the best red teamer that

2602
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,960
ever walked on the face of the planet

2603
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,239
and that's awesome but

2604
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,560
that doesn't help you if if the person

2605
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,239
that you're talking to is really looking

2606
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:23,360
for blue team skills um it doesn't help

2607
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,679
if they're looking for red team skills

2608
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,840
but the red team people have to work

2609
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,679
with the blue team people

2610
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,960
so keep in mind another interesting

2611
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:33,679
point is

2612
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,760
red teams don't get paid unless they

2613
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,400
produce the report

2614
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,239
touche absolutely exactly

2615
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,480
yeah don't don't forget the things that

2616
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,639
may not seem so obvious just technical

2617
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:50,639
skills is not the end of the discussion

2618
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,520
wow okay so i we have a quite a few

2619
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,120
questions in the chat in less than 10

2620
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,840
minutes

2621
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,440
uh to go so i wanted to get through some

2622
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,040
of them maybe this was a quick one i

2623
01:33:59,040 --> 01:33:59,760
don't know

2624
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,199
hopefully all right how soon should one

2625
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,560
specialize instead of

2626
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,280
uh being a jack of all trades in cyber

2627
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,400
security

2628
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,239
great question when you realize you're

2629
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:18,000
good at it and you want to do it

2630
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,920
tell people this you eventually you will

2631
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,840
find what is it that you like

2632
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,400
the most to do uh i knew for example

2633
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,080
when they put me in psychology

2634
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,920
and i had to push configurations for

2635
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,760
fireworks i'm like ah this is not gonna

2636
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,639
cut it

2637
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,760
uh and when i did pentester said oh this

2638
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,760
is i'm very enthused about this

2639
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,920
so so that's what i tell people try to

2640
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:38,800
give it a try

2641
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,239
right and find that who you

2642
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,360
truly wanna um pursue

2643
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,600
and i'd like to say this also about you

2644
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,040
the last question

2645
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,040
i personally it was very hard for me to

2646
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,560
break in cyber security i

2647
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,679
i it took me three years that's

2648
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,280
i count and look back i was an i.t

2649
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,280
and i was a support engineer and that

2650
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,360
sort of gave me a little bit of a

2651
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,400
a at times a little bit of exposure but

2652
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,920
i can tell you this the companies

2653
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,600
would never even call me back um

2654
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,280
the companies who only wanted to hire

2655
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,280
people from the security industry

2656
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,600
the industry itself has changed a little

2657
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,719
bit

2658
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,679
but um when i started in security i took

2659
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:22,480
a pay cut

2660
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,119
i took around a 10 20 000 pay cut

2661
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,719
because i was in another industry where

2662
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:26,960
i

2663
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,480
i had capped obviously but i knew that

2664
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,360
that was my cap

2665
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,080
i said this is it there's no hire i'm

2666
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,760
not going to become a manager

2667
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,920
um and then i started looking into the

2668
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,960
cyber security

2669
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,520
and it wasn't that easy i had to go to

2670
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,480
these groups

2671
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,960
i had to prove myself i had to make

2672
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:45,840
friendships

2673
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,080
i had to network i had to play the

2674
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,679
sketch with the flags and it was

2675
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,520
incredibly frustrated

2676
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,080
uh at times because i would i wouldn't

2677
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:54,719
score

2678
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,000
i wouldn't get it anywhere um and and it

2679
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,280
took me three years

2680
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,080
it wasn't easy nowadays it's not that

2681
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,040
difficult

2682
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,119
because there are programs for it there

2683
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:06,320
are groups like this

2684
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,440
but but uh it was not like that

2685
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,960
uh back then it was very difficult

2686
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,560
all right i'm gonna jump in with a

2687
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,800
little bit more of a technical question

2688
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,679
um i'm like speaking about speed rounds

2689
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:20,639
um

2690
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,320
with the emergence of blockchain

2691
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,159
technologies and its focus on encryption

2692
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,239
and security along with the hype

2693
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,440
what are some opinions or misconceptions

2694
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:29,920
that you

2695
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,360
found with the industry involving

2696
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,199
blockchain um

2697
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:38,480
the importance of blockchain

2698
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,839
that's the answer i think

2699
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,040
is the the best person to answer this

2700
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,440
question

2701
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:50,960
i think you guys the other day that all

2702
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,119
going to be basically meaningless

2703
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,119
in what like three months four months

2704
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,080
like they're going i mean i've read that

2705
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,119
article too

2706
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:00,480
yeah i think like here's what i think uh

2707
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,880
seriously on the on the on the topic i

2708
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,840
think

2709
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,560
a new technology emerges and a lot of

2710
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,320
people get excited about it

2711
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,400
and the problem is is that a lot of

2712
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,800
people want to implement this technology

2713
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,199
rather than have a problem that they

2714
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,960
need a solution for

2715
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,960
and use a technology that solves that

2716
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,119
problem they are trying to use this

2717
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:21,840
technology

2718
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,400
in every bit of space that they possibly

2719
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:24,880
can

2720
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,560
and trying to solve problems that don't

2721
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,000
exist so

2722
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,159
that's my that's my two cents on the

2723
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:31,440
matter

2724
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,679
okay next question um and i really

2725
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:35,199
wanted to ask this one as well

2726
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,320
um roger wants to know

2727
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,159
how do you balance a team's need for a

2728
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,840
strong cultural fit

2729
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,320
with maintaining an inclusive group that

2730
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,360
doesn't box

2731
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,000
out good people or have certain

2732
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,639
ingrained

2733
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,480
prejudices this is such a good question

2734
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,639
such a good question um i am the only

2735
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:55,920
girl well

2736
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,840
one of only two women on my team and

2737
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,280
definitely like the only women of color

2738
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,000
but

2739
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,920
also i work at swan everybody is so nice

2740
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,040
i don't even know how else to say it

2741
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:03,440
like

2742
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,400
it's like working with a bunch of

2743
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,239
labrador puppies but i would love to

2744
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:06,960
know

2745
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,090
what is it everybody's so nice

2746
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:12,080
[Laughter]

2747
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:17,440
but can you answer this for me everyone

2748
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,800
do you want to stop countries yeah go

2749
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,880
ahead

2750
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,760
well okay so so i can say

2751
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,080
at least from the perspective of being

2752
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,800
female

2753
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,840
um uh

2754
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,360
historically for years um i i've been

2755
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,199
one of very few females

2756
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:42,000
in whatever it is that i've been doing

2757
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,199
um

2758
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,719
and and i usually

2759
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,920
um get along well with the males

2760
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,199
i don't um you know

2761
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:56,480
i i try not to have a thin skin about

2762
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,639
anything with anyone

2763
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,800
um so you know to me

2764
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,960
you know some people might be upset if

2765
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,920
people say certain things or whatever

2766
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,119
um i'm not that person i'm there i'm

2767
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,440
there to learn and to do a job

2768
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,239
and if it's not adding to that then i

2769
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,199
may choose to

2770
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:20,239
to move on and do something else but i i

2771
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:20,719
try

2772
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,440
not to be a thin skinned person because

2773
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:23,760
i

2774
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,679
i just don't see that that's gonna get

2775
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,119
me anywhere

2776
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:31,119
um in terms of fitting in with the group

2777
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,760
uh you know to me that's one of the

2778
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,400
things that you need to

2779
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,760
everybody needs to to

2780
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,920
understand and work on that um so

2781
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,239
you know most of the people that i work

2782
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,600
with i'll i'll tell them

2783
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,880
you know pretty pretty quickly after you

2784
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,440
hear me

2785
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,040
talk you're probably gonna understand

2786
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,280
and i'll say you know hey this may be

2787
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,119
coming from a hillbilly perspective

2788
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:59,920
because people are gonna hear my accent

2789
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,520
and they're gonna know

2790
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,480
i'm probably from tennessee or texas or

2791
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,840
someplace like that

2792
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,840
um you know i just roll with

2793
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:14,159
it i i i try not to get caught up in it

2794
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,360
because my feeling is if it is a

2795
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,639
good cultural fit if i

2796
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,400
if i fit well with the group and the

2797
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,159
group fits well with me

2798
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:27,119
then that that chemistry just happens i

2799
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:27,600
i

2800
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,880
try not to put barriers

2801
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,360
to it and just let it you know it's like

2802
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,440
water water is going to take the path of

2803
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,920
least resistance if it's a fit it will

2804
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:38,239
go

2805
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:41,040
there for you don't make artificial

2806
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,520
barriers to that happening

2807
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,480
and i've had good success with that so

2808
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,040
what about

2809
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,280
on the flip side of that not as an

2810
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,880
incoming employee

2811
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,040
or sorry not as an incoming employee but

2812
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,119
but the person that's running the team

2813
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,159
themselves

2814
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,000
how can you look at it from that side

2815
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,800
like how can you ensure

2816
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,480
you know one of the things that i do

2817
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,080
when i reach out when

2818
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,159
when it's going the other way around is

2819
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:07,360
i try to look

2820
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,600
for things that that i can clearly see a

2821
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,080
person excelling in

2822
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:17,280
um and and a lot of times

2823
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,760
what i'll do is approach them i'm i try

2824
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,760
to make it a point to say

2825
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,000
you know i see that you are really good

2826
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,760
at this thing

2827
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,239
um and set up a rapport with them

2828
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:32,800
where you know like i i have somebody on

2829
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,920
my team that i call eagle eyes

2830
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,840
and i call her that because she

2831
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,880
man you can give her the biggest heap of

2832
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,520
garbage

2833
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,560
data anywhere and she will go through it

2834
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,280
and she will

2835
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,320
find the anomaly it doesn't matter

2836
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,440
how as like tuna you know with his

2837
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,920
with his freaking bots you know people

2838
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,000
some people just are doing stuff he

2839
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,360
could find it

2840
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,480
and um so i said hey you know you're

2841
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,679
great at that

2842
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:06,080
do you mind if i call you eagle eyes she

2843
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,760
laughed she said no now the whole teen

2844
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,360
calls her equalized

2845
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,400
but everybody bonded over that

2846
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,719
so and and i i guess i wouldn't call

2847
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,040
that culture per se i mean it's not

2848
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,320
tied to her being you know whatever

2849
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,360
uh a cultural group

2850
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:26,480
but in terms of the building of the team

2851
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,840
um i try to find what people are good at

2852
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,719
i ask them i always ask them i never

2853
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:33,600
assume

2854
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,600
but i say man you're fantastic at that

2855
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,679
do you mind if i call you eagle eyes she

2856
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:38,719
says yeah

2857
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,239
now now everybody knows a if you have

2858
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:42,560
that

2859
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,119
issue go to her so you've kind of set

2860
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:45,840
her up as

2861
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,199
a as a um sme

2862
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:52,320
a subject matter expert on that and then

2863
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,679
everybody else

2864
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,840
just uh the water follows the path right

2865
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,119
so i just try to point out things that

2866
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:02,320
maybe someone didn't

2867
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,960
point out but that that foster that kind

2868
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,080
of culture and and team building

2869
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,639
that's fantastic um gentlemen do you

2870
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,119
have anything for that

2871
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,360
yeah i'll i'll speak on it real quick i

2872
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,199
think um

2873
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:18,960
i think it's a very difficult question

2874
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,719
to approach uh

2875
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:24,320
from somebody you know like

2876
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,560
uh i agree with patrice i think having

2877
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,600
the thick skin

2878
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,239
is certainly useful in this uh in this

2879
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:31,520
line of work

2880
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,159
what i think even like even saying that

2881
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,159
even kind of discussing that is kind of

2882
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:36,880
like

2883
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,920
i don't say it's wrong but like

2884
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,719
uh in order for you to get a like

2885
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:43,520
culture

2886
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,880
and uh you know good folks like

2887
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,960
you maybe like not necessarily need

2888
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,320
somebody that needs to have thick skin

2889
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,360
as well because you might just be

2890
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,960
excluding people that don't necessarily

2891
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,000
have thick skin

2892
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,760
and you're just telling them like oh you

2893
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,360
should be okay with the stupid that

2894
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,320
these people say

2895
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,600
like that's not okay awesome um but

2896
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,480
like i think that um as somebody who's

2897
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,239
like led teams before like

2898
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:09,520
uh creating uh outside team

2899
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,360
bonding experiences will help with that

2900
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,040
and you'll kind of quickly find out like

2901
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,119
does the team mesh well uh are they are

2902
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,320
they doing things

2903
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,880
um uh when you're when i was working in

2904
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:19,600
the sock

2905
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,639
uh i like i've not been in the military

2906
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,239
and i can't say this for sure but like

2907
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:26,880
i was fighting attacks uh i took it

2908
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,960
personally that people were attacking me

2909
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,639
um and the companies that i was

2910
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,800
protecting and i couldn't have done that

2911
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,400
if i didn't trust the guy sitting next

2912
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,040
to me

2913
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,000
so um having that bond having that like

2914
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,920
kind of culture inside of my team

2915
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,520
uh was very important for us to be able

2916
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,040
to do our job well

2917
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,719
so um you know i think we're in kind of

2918
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:47,280
a different

2919
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,679
era i just yesterday took a bunch of

2920
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,440
trainings on microaggressions

2921
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,119
um and then i thought it was hilarious

2922
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,719
because i watched a couple episodes of

2923
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:56,000
silicon valley talking about

2924
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,199
microaggressions

2925
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,880
so i think we're moving to this place

2926
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,639
where we want to be like very inclusive

2927
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:01,520
of everybody

2928
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,239
but i also come from a space that like

2929
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:04,960
um

2930
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,520
early on in the security industry like a

2931
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,360
way of hazing somebody was getting them

2932
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,880
to click on goatsi

2933
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,119
or getting them to look at some

2934
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,040
up website that you should never look at

2935
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,239
and you should not be exposed to that

2936
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:17,760
but like i was exposed to that and that

2937
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,119
was my upbringing

2938
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:21,119
so like if somebody shows me something

2939
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:22,400
that's up i'm not gonna like shy

2940
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,920
away from it i'm not gonna leave a group

2941
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,880
because somebody says something

2942
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,960
outrageous that's just not how i am

2943
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,400
but i understand that nowadays we're

2944
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,400
moving into a place where um not

2945
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,239
everybody was exposed to that and it's

2946
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:32,880
like

2947
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,880
probably also not okay to try to get

2948
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,719
somebody to look at meatspin.com

2949
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,440
like you know what i mean so i think

2950
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:45,520
it's tough i think it's a challenge

2951
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,840
rob do you have anything for us yeah

2952
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,119
well i do have a

2953
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,119
yeah i agree with them but i i'll have

2954
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,560
to say this and they

2955
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,880
this comes with what he just said we

2956
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,360
weren't in newer times

2957
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,679
but you had to understand and i'm trying

2958
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,760
to say this without

2959
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,520
can i say this i'm going to say this is

2960
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,880
a person that one

2961
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,400
is minority two uh took some time to

2962
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,520
break

2963
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:13,199
into the industry it is important

2964
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,119
all this new stuff is important the

2965
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,199
inclusiveness the respect

2966
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,679
all the stuff but at the end of the day

2967
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:20,880
infosec

2968
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,040
is the people that cleans the sewage

2969
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,960
from the internet

2970
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,600
criminals will never be polite will

2971
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,440
never be politically correct

2972
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:32,239
then you're going to see bad stuff so if

2973
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:33,920
you don't have the thick

2974
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,159
skin like they just said you're not

2975
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:37,520
going to make it i'm sorry to tell you

2976
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,560

01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,840
you need to understand i know there's a

2982
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,920
there's there's this glamorization of

2983
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,000
infosec and some people think that is

2984
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,239
i'm just gonna go into hot topic and

2985
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:53,520
then

2986
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,639
tweet like on lead and dude that is

2987
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,320
not infosec these are

2988
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,600
problems this is this is we're now in a

2989
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,760
point where people may actually die

2990
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,199
for a ransomware attack when you work

2991
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,000
in this industry is tough this is not

2992
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,760
rosy this is not

2993
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,040
you know all the kumbaya no it is

2994
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,560
important to have environments that are

2995
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,960
inclusive it is important to have

2996
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,800
people that understand you that

2997
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,400
culturally upset you

2998
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,480
but it's also good for you to be

2999
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,560
prepared because you're going to be

3000
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,119
challenged

3001
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:30,000
and it's going to be tough so don't

3002
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,560
don't

3003
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,000
don't don't confuse inclusiveness with

3004
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,320
oh we can see these things right there

3005
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,840
will be investigations you're going to

3006
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,159
have to there will be tension i remember

3007
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:43,280
uh but reason uh uh

3008
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,920
ace can tell you there were attacks

3009
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,600
everybody was crossing

3010
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,040
right like the you see the screens and

3011
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,040
we were down and then like dude they

3012
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,960
just kicked our ass

3013
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,119
and on the other side of that conference

3014
01:47:57,119 --> 01:47:58,000
call is the

3015
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,840
the customer that's paying us a million

3016
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,199
dollars a month

3017
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:04,000
i mean this this is this is serious

3018
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,719
business

3019
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,679
i know we say this is a as a mockery but

3020
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,520
the internet is a serious business and

3021
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,199
you're gonna be exposed

3022
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:12,400
at one point you're gonna see something

3023
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,199
you don't like so so always consider

3024
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:15,600
that

3025
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,679
consider that because this is this is

3026
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:18,880
not rosy

3027
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,560
this is not uh uh historic this is

3028
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,440
i consider a lifestyle so that i like to

3029
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,480
point that out for

3030
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,960
all of those who are coming and i i had

3031
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,440
to see it i saw it with different groups

3032
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,960
that are of course depends on where you

3033
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,480
work right if you work and the west

3034
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,840
coast is a little different you're going

3035
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,520
to east coast a little different

3036
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,400
but always be aware of that the the the

3037
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,360
infosec

3038
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,679
i always describe it when you go on

3039
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:45,040
night in new york you see those people

3040
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,719
under the sewage that's us

3041
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,880
without us it will be a disaster

3042
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,840
somebody will have to

3043
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,520
somebody has to do their work that's

3044
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,639
what we do we clean it

3045
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:56,239
there's a there's a particularly

3046
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,639
interesting attack that came to mind

3047
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,920
uh that i believe the plx cert team did

3048
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,040
research on

3049
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,880
and the hacker attributed with the

3050
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,320
attack was named

3051
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,280
 got raped

3052
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,960
remember that that we actually that was

3053
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,639
even discussed i'm like how are we going

3054
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,400
to write this on our report

3055
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,440
right right and that was his name that

3056
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,480
was his name

3057
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,159
that was his name and actually once we

3058
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,719
posted that report he tweeted it with

3059
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,080
the same thing basically

3060
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,599
he's like thank you that's me you're

3061
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:29,440
like okay you see that that's cyber

3062
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,320
climb right there

3063
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,760
these people are not gonna change

3064
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,520
they're not interested in and

3065
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,520
it was politically correct or not they

3066
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,360
don't care if you get offended or not i

3067
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,960
mean if you see the things that all of

3068
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,960
us have seen like when you see like the

3069
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,000
raw internet

3070
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,360
the things that they're getting

3071
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,920
dude you you had to have some thick skin

3072
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,000
you had to have them

3073
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,639
you have to keep in mind that you don't

3074
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:54,719
have to be aligned with someone

3075
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:57,679
to learn from them you know and that's a

3076
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,520
good point

3077
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,119
take the value take what the value is

3078
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,119
and don't get hung up on what the value

3079
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:07,598
is not

3080
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,679
uh is that hackers will try to throw you

3081
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:18,080
off

3082
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,000
your emotional game so that you do not

3083
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,920
think rationally

3084
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,480
they will try to trigger you they will

3085
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,480
try to make you feel uncomfortable

3086
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,840
so that you don't make the right

3087
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,840
decision

3088
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,440
yep i was thinking of this question more

3089
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,719
from the perspective of me

3090
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,880
being from miami talking to like a team

3091
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,719
in i don't know in cali and being

3092
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,400
able to say that bro and maybe that not

3093
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,159
being a good cultural fit but yeah this

3094
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:44,800
is a very

3095
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,440
interesting point too obviously you do

3096
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,679
encounter some very heavy things and you

3097
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,520
have to be ready for it um

3098
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,800
on the other side

3099
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,320
i was gonna say the part that you

3100
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,080
brought up is also very significant as

3101
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:58,800
well

3102
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,119
um i've actually on the team that i'm on

3103
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,199
now i work with teams like literally all

3104
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:04,400
across the world now

3105
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,560
and this has like got me thinking about

3106
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,159
solving problems in a different way

3107
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,760
because i have worked with

3108
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,080
folks that have complete completely

3109
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,080
different cultures than myself

3110
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,800
and i actually value this so much like

3111
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,080
the fact that i've been able to work

3112
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,599
with teams in eastern europe

3113
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:22,159
or in india or on the west coast and see

3114
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,040
how they work

3115
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,560
and see what they the way they solve

3116
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,840
challenges and to see that to the way

3117
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:26,719
that they do things

3118
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,920
has been uh immense for me

3119
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,360
being able to look at a challenge and

3120
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,119
dissect it in a different mindset than

3121
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,119
me just thinking about it from my

3122
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:39,679

3125
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,560

01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,199

01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,080
that we

3143
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,000
uh would wrap up in-person hack miami

3144
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,159
meetings was usually going to like a bar

3145
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:35,840
or a place where we could get some food

3146
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,199
and then we would just kind of wind down

3147
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:37,760
and if the

3148
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,960
if the talk was like particularly

3149
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,639
interesting the conversations would just

3150
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:41,440
keep going

3151
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,119
and there's been several conversations

3152
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:44,800
that have led into like multi

3153
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,320
like uh uh rod mentioned uh uh chad

3154
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:48,880
earlier

3155
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,639
there's been times where we go to a we

3156
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:52,000
go to a meeting

3157
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,599
and then him and i spend the next couple

3158
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,280
days like hacking on something or

3159
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:56,000
whatever

3160
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,520
and just you know and that's just the

3161
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,280
way it turns out so uh

3162
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,000
since we've sort of have these uh

3163
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,679
virtual meetings

3164
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,040

3165
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,480

don't see new blood and that's that's

3176
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:26,639
that's what we see now listen

3177
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:27,599
what do you start throwing at a

3178
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:28,800
conference you're gonna start seeing a

3179
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,639
lot of white hair a lot of white gray

3180
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:34,320
hair it's unfortunate but it looks like

3181
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,320
and this is coming back from the last

3182
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,080
question there's a lot there's a reason

3183
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,239
why there's a lot of alcoholism divorces

3184
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:42,320
this is i tell some people this is like

3185
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,679
the healthcare industry

3186
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:45,760
the stress that you're put through in

3187
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,040
some of these positions

3188
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,840
it will affect you and and we need new

3189
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:50,239

3199
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,080

a few
