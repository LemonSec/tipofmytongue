miami today

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,440
we have

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
uh introduction to how we're hacking

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,720
with honey

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
uh and uh we

11

uh i'm gonna pass it to honey she is

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,200
a member of uh miami she's also been at

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,840
defcon uh and she is actually part of

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,719
the

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
howard hiking village uh and we're gonna

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,120
let her introduce us into uh hardware

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,640
hacking 101 take it away thanks can

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
y'all see my screen can you hear me okay

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,199
yes

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,119
awesome all right i got my subtitles on

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,119
hey uh this was probably the most

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
challenging presentation i've ever made

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
uh and i want to apologize in advance

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
i'm sick

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
so i'm not feeling great today so

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,479
if you hear the sniffles in the coughs

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,600
i'm sorry

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
we're gonna work through it um

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as rod said i'm a volunteer i've been a

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
member of hack miami for like

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,240
i'm not saying how long because that's a

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,400
long time at this point um and i've been

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
part of defcon hardware hacking village

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
for like

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
about six years at this point uh you can

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,439
find me on discord if you want that's my

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,840
specific honey i'm one of the many

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,000
um i always do disclosures and liability

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
statements at the beginning of all of my

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
presentations for hack miami because

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
um i i don't know what you guys are

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,759
going to do with this information that

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,680
we covered today and therefore i can't

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
tell you whether or not you're doing

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,079
something that you might not want to be

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
doing but i will tell you that in

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
hardware hacking you're definitely going

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
to encounter dangerous substances

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
you're definitely going to incr

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,040
lead toxic fumes

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
metals all sorts of good stuff so you

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,800
want to make sure that you are

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,239
protecting your bodies and keeping

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
yourself safe

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
and also you're going to avoid all the

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
warranties on everything you touch so

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
just know that and it's your

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
responsibility to stay within compliance

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,319
of

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
state federal national global whatever

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,959
laws that's on you folks yeah avoid all

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,480
the warranties man

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,959
right to repair

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,720
all right so um

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
i'm all about that but um just so you

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
know that's on you fam all right so

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
moving on uh

75
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
so after doing all this research on

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
hardware hacking i now get every joke in

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
that episode that i did not get before

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
uh wait let me go back

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
so

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,160
i'm honey i started out in hacking in

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,879
the se world social engineering as a

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
defensive skill

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
and once i

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
because i got hacked pretty hard and i

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
wanted to make sure it didn't happen

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
again so i started learning everything i

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,640
could learn everything i could get to

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,599
um

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
and i liked it and i was good at it and

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
the more i learned the more i realized

91
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
how social engineering is really creepy

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,319
and

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319
ocean is even creepier

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
and i kind of wanted to start

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,760
researching

96
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,599
what i considered to be the polar

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,920
opposite of those skills which was

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,159
hardware hacking um after this

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,319
presentation i'm i'm gonna stay where i

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,239
belong in se and in uh ocean because

101
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
this was meaty for me and i i hope you

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,440
guys gained something out of it i

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,000
learned so much doing this research so

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,959
um yeah don't break the laws uh safety

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,959
equipment also just you know you're

106
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,319
gonna inhale a lot of these fumes and um

107
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,080
you don't get prophetic visions from it

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
you just get brain damage so please just

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,200
make sure that you're protecting

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,319
yourselves

111
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,599
and also make sure that whatever

112
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,680
substance especially if you're soldering

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
or de-soldering whatever um

114
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
solder falls down so make sure that it

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
don't solder over your lap or over like

116
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,080
your skin and if you're gonna do that

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,599
just wear natural fibers so that you

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
don't burn your

119
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
stuff off

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,799
right okay

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,439
um so what is hardware hacking um it's

122
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
not what i thought it was when i started

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
this presentation it's not what it's so

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
much bigger than that it's so much it's

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
huge

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
basically any alteration of an

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
electronic device or machine that makes

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,440
it do something that the original

129
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,560
manufacturer didn't intend

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,479
you can add parts you can take away

131
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
parts you can speed up your clocks we'll

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
get into it but pretty much like

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,240
everything can be hardware hacking so

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
uh i went down the rabbit hole pretty

135
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
deep on this and i came up with a good

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,080
spectrum of stuff i learned some stuff

137
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,759
about electrical engineering so if

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,639
you're going to be in the hardware

139
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
hacking world you're definitely going to

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
want to do some some basic electrical

141
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
stuff that's that's

142
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
it it's also fixing though and

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
repurposing making your own use for

144
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
things

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,479
so

146
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,560
hardware hacking is such a broad topic

147
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
that

148
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,280
i i figured like pretty much like

149
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
everything at this point um

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
hold on i'm just checking the chat so

151
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,800
yeah i put the

152
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
roster i put the subtitles to spanish

153
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
the people who speak english can hear me

154
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,639
sorry

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,440
all right so um

156
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,199
yeah so making your own use for things

157
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
um

158
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,280
does anyone remember furbies

159
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
furbies are where this rabbit hole led

160
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,120
me pretty pretty early on and i gotta

161
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,880
tell you man i didn't like it

162
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
oh they're horrible we're i'm gonna show

163
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,919
you yeah we'll get there all right so

164
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
all of these things can be considered um

165
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
hardware hacking it's not just the stuff

166
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,400
that you think of like the rubber

167
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,600
duckies and the wi-fi pineapples it's

168
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,039
it's the furby hacking too

169
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,919
it's all right um tools that i recommend

170
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,520
that you

171
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
start with and and the other thing about

172
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
hardware hacking is it's super super

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
um

174
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
project specific

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
it's very project specific so depending

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
on what you're trying to do with what

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
device on what interface on what chip

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
with which sensor or whatever

179
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
you need a different tool set so the

180
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
ifixit kit is pretty much considered

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
your assembly disassembly kit like you

182
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,919
mix this with the soldering set and and

183
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,039
that's your

184
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
your hardware components for the most

185
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,080
part and i fix it'll help you

186
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,639
disassemble some really tricky stuff too

187
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,240
not that i'm trying to plug it it's just

188
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,840
i mean you can go and get all of those

189
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
tools yourself

190
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
but um

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,000
the kit just kind of has everything um

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
using that kit you'll void the warranty

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
right there

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
um

195
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,319
so and some kind of interface a tool

196
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,840
that lets you interact with the chips or

197
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
components that you're trying to use

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
i'll give you the top three tools that

199
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
when i did some interviews i came across

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,759
and um

201
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,160
we'll get into that in a later one logic

202
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
analyzers and oscilloscopes those those

203
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
get real specific and there's a whole

204
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
argument over which one to use

205
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
in what circumstance so it's very

206
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
specific to the project that you're

207
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
trying to use um i read an article about

208
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
a guy who hacked a

209
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
projector a lidar projector using just

210
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
an oscilloscope but in the end he

211
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,599
couldn't decipher the data that he got

212
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,840
from it because it was in such raw

213
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,360
form so

214
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,160
again it's very project specific um

215
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
you're gonna need google you're gonna

216
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
need github you're gonna need reddit and

217
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
a raspberry pi and an arduino can't help

218
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,880
and this is just my first um

219
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,520
of two only two hardware hacking village

220
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,400
defcon plugs um

221
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,719
they have a cali distribution a cali

222
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
with all the tools loaded on it

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
everything you need it's updated

224
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,560
regularly so it's got all sorts of uh

225
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
functional stuff and i've got links

226
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
every every part of this presentation

227
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
has links to either the article that i

228
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
got the research from

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
or to the product that i'm telling you

230
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,160
about so that afterwards i can send you

231
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
the you can go ahead and

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
go on a click journey like i did

233
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,319
uh

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
uh yeah okay so we're still on the

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,720
furbies okay nothing in the chat um

236
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
all right so you've got to be able to

237
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
communicate with the devices

238
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
in their language uh and these are these

239
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,199
are pretty much the top three

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
common uh protocols languages

241
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
anyway it gets real deep into electrical

242
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
engineering like some of these aren't

243
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
really protocols but just a jake tag is

244
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,160
not a protocol so

245
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
how you program the machine when you

246
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
first uh

247
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
inject the code i guess into the chip

248
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,479
and some people lock their jtags some

249
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
don't this the jtag is like most

250
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
synonymously used with the xbox 360 hack

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
but really you can use them for

252
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,839
everything um and they do use them for

253
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,800
everything

254
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
um some people lock their jtags like

255
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,640
some manufacturers will lock the uh

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
not the port but the ability to use it

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
and a lot don't so it never hurts to try

258
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
and jtag when you find

259
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
a concrete definition for the word jtag

260
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,000
you let me know fam because that was one

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
that i had a rough time on too

262
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,000
um

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
okay so depending on which protocol

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,800
what you're talking to and and you just

265
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,959
google it nobody remembers everything so

266
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,560
you just google okay i'm trying to

267
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
interface with this microcontroller you

268
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
just google it and it'll tell you what

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
what protocols to use and what machines

270
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,440
use it so everybody uses uh google and

271
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
github

272
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,320
no matter how experienced you are you

273
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
can't remember all of this stuff

274
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
all right so

275
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
um i tried to include three different

276
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,760
these are multi-protocol variable

277
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
voltage tools you could say that five

278
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
times fast and i'll buy you a beer at

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
winter hacker festival

280
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
um if just take a look at the boards for

281
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,000
a second um they're super well labeled

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
super well labeled i hope you're not

283
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,399
trying to watch this on a phone

284
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,760
otherwise it's like

285
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
way tiny

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,839
um

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
the tiger is the newest of the three

288
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,519
and my hardware hacking buddy bunny who

289
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,839
is our lead at hardware hacking village

290
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,320
defcon this is the one that he uses and

291
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
recommends but he says the bus pirate

292
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
does more but it's kind of a shaky piece

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,800
of equipment sometimes it works

294
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,560
sometimes it doesn't um but it's great

295
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
and it does a lot but the tigger does or

296
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,120
tiger

297
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,000
does

298
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what it does very well

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
and you can see they're almost the same

300
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,000
they've got the same pins little lights

301
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
that tell you uh what you're using i

302
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
like the on off switch for the two guard

303
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,839
tigered

304
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
can you see my pen

305
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
if i use my pen my laser pointer here

306
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,760
i'm gonna use my laser pointer this

307
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
thing is cool this this eliminates like

308
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
a whole

309
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,399
whole side of these boards because you

310
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
could just toggle this on and off

311
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,399
um

312
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,680
no no weird programming needed so

313
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
but the bus pirate does a million things

314
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,000
um there are links to each of these like

315
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
when you click this it'll gain you

316
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
and i included the adafruit one the

317
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
adafruit one is the cheapest of the

318
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
three it does the three main components

319
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
um

320
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,880
you can see right here it's got all your

321
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
grounds it's got all your ports um

322
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,760
they're

323
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,519
variable voltage means that you can use

324
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
them in three volt or five volt the

325
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
seaguard goes all the way from one point

326
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
eight volts to five volts so that's kind

327
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,160
of cool

328
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
um the eight is the smallest but it's

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
also the cheapest um

330
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
and it's always in stock so that's

331
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
always nice

332
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
it does ic2 you can see it here they're

333
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
labeled very well see if you want to

334
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,720
just take a second to look at these

335
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
boards and these are what help you

336
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
interface with

337
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
whatever you're trying to interface with

338
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,399
whether it's a screen that you're trying

339
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,880
to see if it works or if it's a

340
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
chip on a board that you're trying to

341
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,720
look at

342
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,839
i kind of just want to give you guys a

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,040
second to

344
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
look it over and zoom in can i zoom in

345
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,839
here oh i

346
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,399
can look at that

347
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,639
all right

348
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
and the goal is

349
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
it is it zoomed in

350
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,079
yes

351
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,600
there we go and and i legit i just

352
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
straight up stole these pictures right

353
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,959
off the manufacturer website so it's not

354
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,639
like this is some secret and i give you

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
the link to the stores where you can buy

356
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
them if you're into it they're pretty

357
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
cheap considering all the functions that

358
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,279
they do

359
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
um

360
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
you can also buy an individual tool to

361
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
do each of these things if you wanted

362
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
and that tool would probably work

363
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
wonderfully but then you're carrying

364
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
around a box of tools which you know

365
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
some people don't mind

366
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
some people check their luggage when

367
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
they go to defcon some people carry a

368
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
backpack i'm one of those backpack

369
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
people

370
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,680
um so on top of these devices that help

371
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
you interface with

372
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
whatever you're trying to interface with

373
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
whether it's a chip

374
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
or the back of a teddy ruxpin or

375
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
that one was horrifying

376
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
that that was that was the one that's

377
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
going to be in my nightmares tonight the

378
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,399
teddy ruxpin i found

379
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
um

380
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
yeah

381
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
but whatever you're trying to interface

382
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,200
with so this is what will help you

383
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
interface with the hardware you also

384
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
need to interface with the software so

385
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
let me turn off my laser pointer

386
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,240
there we go

387
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
um this is just this is just a drop in

388
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,639
the bucket there are literally

389
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
hundreds of different softwares that you

390
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,720
can use free circuit analysis oh thank

391
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
you thanks mike that's what's up

392
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,880
excellent uh guys check the chat for a

393
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
free circuit

394
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,440
analysis and design

395
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,880
excuse me sorry to cough in your ear

396
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,800
folks um

397
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,240
these are all included and then this is

398
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,079
my second hardware hacking village plug

399
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,079
i promise um and the only reason i

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,760
include this link

401
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
this is the link to their their cali

402
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
distro on

403
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
on github and it's got all the tools

404
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,120
that

405
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
they recommend using and that i say we

406
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
recommend using but this stuff is

407
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
it goes real deep so

408
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
these are some of the tools that you can

409
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
find the software that you need because

410
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,639
once you interface with the hardware

411
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,480
then you've got to find a way to

412
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,079
translate what the hardware is saying so

413
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
that you can read it and interface with

414
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,639
it most the bus pirate the

415
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,079
um

416
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
and don't google it backwards because if

417
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,240
you google pirate bus

418
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
you get a whole lot of really weird sea

419
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,880
shanties and a dude who converted a

420
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,240
school bus

421
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,199
into a pirate bus so the bus pirate um

422
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
they come with their own software

423
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
libraries too so if you are interested

424
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
in that hardware then um

425
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,839
it comes with the software that you need

426
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,680
to read and then cali is always the

427
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,120
recommended everything for everything

428
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,240
uh oh yeah great that is like another

429
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,839
thing thank you um oh phil what's up hey

430
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,959
hey honey

431
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
who are you

432
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
oh my god hey you tell me about the

433
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
great foot i i've been talking too much

434
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,959
tell me about the great

435
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
no i don't want to jump in here on your

436
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
speech but uh it's a good little gadget

437
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
it's a great little gadget um i haven't

438
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,399
really taken advantage of it to its full

439
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,480
potential but um

440
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,399
it does all the same protocols

441
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,720
uh does you allow you to do like

442
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
interactive uh programming but the

443
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
coolest thing that does is allow you to

444
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,279
do um

445
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,639
usb

446
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
uh emulation

447
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,079
so there's some pretty cool attacks that

448
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,720
you can pull off by emulating a flash

449
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
drive and then simulating a whole file

450
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,920
system so it's really cool attacks i've

451
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,279
actually been wanting to do a talk on it

452
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,320
for a while

453
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
but uh it's a little bit pricier but

454
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,399
it's a really cool device

455
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
you know what that you pay for quality

456
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,240
though so and especially if it's going

457
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,680
to be something that you use more than

458
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,839
once or you or it becomes part of your

459
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,480
everyday tool kit i i say it's worth it

460
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,800
to spend the money but i also

461
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,800
buy a lot of badges at def con so um

462
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
but yeah all right thanks yeah great fed

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
is one of the tools i came across um

464
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
it's so you can't list every tool there

465
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,720
are so so so so many out there which is

466
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
why

467
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
i say that if you're interested in

468
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,839
learning um hardware hacking that one of

469
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,279
the best places to start are those

470
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,160
blinky badges from from any con you go

471
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
to i just saw one that had a mechanical

472
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,440
lock that opens it's from a con that was

473
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
like last week it was a shape of a lock

474
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,079
you program and it had a mechanical like

475
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,440
it was a

476
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
it looked like a locker lot like a

477
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
combination lock super cool um and those

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
are some of the best places to get

479
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,880
started because

480
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
one you're going to be in a community of

481
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,680
people who are trying to do the same

482
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
thing you are and that helps and two it

483
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
gives you a focused project to learn on

484
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
um

485
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,160
and that is invaluable because if you

486
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
just go

487
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
okay i want to learn about hardware

488
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
hacking like i did

489
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,399
i started with okay i'm gonna hack my

490
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,800
vacuum and then i was like oh man i

491
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,360
really like my vacuum though and i

492
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
if i break it which is entirely a

493
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
hundred percent possible because if you

494
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
solder the wrong thing or you pop

495
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
something like that's it it's done and i

496
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
like my vacuum my little um we got one

497
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
of the ones that's smart enough to to

498
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
make it around the house without falling

499
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
down the steps but stupid enough that it

500
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,839
doesn't map the room which i'm really

501
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
grateful at because we also found that

502
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,640
there's a really amazing hardware hack

503
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
for vacuums where the lidar is getting

504
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,559
hacked and it basically turns your

505
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
vacuum into a listening device

506
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
did anybody come across that ever in the

507
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,359
the hardware hacking world the hack

508
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,919
against it it's just like a year ago or

509
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
so

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
super cool

511
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
so um these are some of the example

512
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,280
softwares that

513
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
that i want to say i recommend but i'm

514
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
really that are popular and then the

515
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,760
cali distro on the hhv

516
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,480
github has so so so much um so i wanted

517
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
to give you some

518
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,600
some examples of what i've come across

519
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,559
um

520
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,840
from common to

521
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,960
up weird

522
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,919
um

523
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
all right so this is the this is one of

524
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
the things that people love to do

525
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
hardware hacks is to crack your to crack

526
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,919
your ex this is an old xbox it only

527
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
works on a certain xbox before a certain

528
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
date and i had one and i lost it in my

529
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
divorce and i'm so sad about that but

530
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,760
it's uh it's what it does is it allows

531
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
you to bypass the

532
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
the uh the control mechanism that

533
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,480
prevents you from playing cracked games

534
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
and you can run homebrew on your on your

535
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
xbox and it's gorgeous uh this is the

536
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
inside of the box again uh when i send

537
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,679
out the powerpoint for this presentation

538
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,760
you can just click on the title that's

539
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,000
underlined that's actually a link

540
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
and it will take you to uh the article

541
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
that i read on how to

542
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,919
how to jtag your xbox 360

543
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,679
which is such an old device at this

544
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
point i'm not i'm sure that there are

545
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
emulators that are so far beyond this so

546
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
that's the other thing about hardware

547
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,039
hacking sometimes there's just easier

548
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,400
stuff you can just

549
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
buy it but if that's not about the

550
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
adventure you want to be about the

551
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,559
adventure

552
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
so cracking your consoles there was a

553
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
crack for the original we too that was

554
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
awesome and then it just lets you play

555
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
your homebrewed downloaded games so

556
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
fun times

557
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,559
um these are probably two of the most

558
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,039
widely known hardware hacking devices

559
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,240
you've got your duckies and your

560
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,960
pineapples um

561
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
i don't know if you consider the

562
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,919
pineapple a lot of people consider the

563
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,840
pineapple of a hardware hack because

564
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
it's a repeater so like the signal was

565
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
only supposed to be within this certain

566
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
area and you're repeating it

567
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
and uh and it allows you to do like man

568
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
middle attacks and all sorts of things

569
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
and then rubber duckies are

570
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
the ducky itself is not a hardware hack

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
what you're doing is you're exploiting

572
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,919
the key uh the usb

573
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,039
by

574
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,039
it's expecting a keyboard or something

575
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,039
friendly so by plugging in

576
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,559
this thing that reads as a keyboard and

577
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
it's a key logger it injects programming

578
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
it does all sorts of cool stuff

579
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,679
um

580
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
has anybody ever used one of these uh

581
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
that wants to do a swim someone who

582
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,879
isn't me used one of these and

583
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,919
you guys are so quiet

584
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,880
should i lean in and wait in the silence

585
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,360
or should i move on

586
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,760
sure i've used a few of them

587
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
uh rubber duckies for an attack and a

588
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,400
few um actually like uh arduino-based

589
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
ones that have multiple payloads

590
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,640
um made a

591
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,559
staged payload using one it was a good

592
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,880
attack

593
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
good time okay

594
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
did you have to pair it with an se

595
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
attack or did you just walk in and shove

596
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
it in the back of the computer and there

597
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,440
you go

598
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
yep basically

599
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,840
um i actually i made a variant for uh

600
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,520
the point was it was supposed to assume

601
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
no privileges could be used on a guest

602
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
account um and it worked for different

603
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,240
variations like 32-bit 64-bit and

604
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
os x this is like six years ago um it

605
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
was a fun little project

606
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
that's what's up that's what's up yeah

607
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,640
that's the fun part about any of the

608
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
malicious hardware hacking stuff usually

609
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,640
and that's the funny part that i didn't

610
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
expect when i started researching

611
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,159
hardware hacking and i started into this

612
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,600
world i started with soldering like

613
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,520
everybody else but i had no idea you

614
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
have to pair

615
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
the delivery of these devices with some

616
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,159
sort of usually

617
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
kind of sophisticated se attack to get

618
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
them

619
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,559
where you want them to be because you

620
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,559
know plugging this into a

621
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,720
crazy radio from mouse jack attack hey

622
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,159
mike do you want to explain that out

623
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,760
loud because i understand all those

624
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,559
words separately

625
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
yeah i'm sorry i want to jump on

626
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,799
you're awesome i'm

627
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,880
just really enjoying your presentation

628
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,200
i know it's actually when i when i set

629
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
up social sect over here on the

630
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
southwest florida uh was one of the

631
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
first demonstrations i did for the crew

632
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
uh just showing that you can buy a

633
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
simple crazy radio pa

634
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
off of amazon or any other electronics

635
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,679
place alibaba or whatever

636
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,520
for i think it's less than twenty

637
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,360
dollars or something it's super simple

638
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
the snag one

639
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,600
and

640
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
you could

641
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
uh just use uh the jacket kit

642
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,720
uh and some cali and

643
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,039
just sit out in the park lot basically

644
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
and just scan for

645
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,320
the um

646
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
the radio signal that's coming off of

647
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,919
your

648
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,919
wireless mics and keyboards

649
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,679
and once you see them showing up then

650
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,200
you can just

651
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,520
intercept the signal and basically um

652
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
inject

653
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
keyboard strokes

654
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
mouse clicks stuff like that

655
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
and so we we did a demo of it and and

656
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,679
basically took over computer and and pop

657
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
notepad and calp just to essentially

658
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,919
show what was possible with a because

659
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,440
people don't typically update their

660
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,960
firmware on their wireless mice and

661
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,000
keyboards

662
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,600
and it's uh it still exists out there

663
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,400
um because most of the vendors weren't

664
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
pushing those updates to the their

665
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,960
firmware little the little universal

666
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,880
usb chips you get with every wireless

667
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,000
mouse and keyboard uh so it's it's a

668
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,320
simple demo to show people

669
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,760
and it still works

670
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,640
that's

671
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,720
unsettling dude

672
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
that's unsettling

673
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,440
um

674
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
i'm i'm a little like

675
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
unhappy that apple's kind of getting rid

676
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,039
of all these ports i still plug my

677
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,960
headphones in when i can and i'm just

678
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
like not ready to move over to bluetooth

679
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
for everything and i feel like i'm being

680
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,640
forced and i really don't like it

681
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,559
i'm gonna i'm ready to go back to my

682
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,320
walkman that i had when i was a child

683
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,039
although those are back in style now

684
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,640
so um

685
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
also another example of a hardware hack

686
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
this is definitely not what the

687
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
manufacturers of the gas pump intended

688
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,799
and it's just a little piece of hardware

689
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,200
it just slips right in there um

690
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
when i was googling this just checking

691
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
my sources over the last couple days i

692
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
came across a news story in michigan

693
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
where they did a random sweep and found

694
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,880
like

695
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
i don't know between 15 and 20 gas

696
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,840
stations in this area that had been

697
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
compromised

698
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,279
and they think it's all the same group

699
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,320
so

700
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,679
these are another example of hardware

701
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,360
this is i started with the malicious

702
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,159
stuff because i know hack miami is at

703
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,279
its core security group uh but i gotta

704
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
tell you hardware hacking gets uh

705
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,039
oh this is for you hack miami

706
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,600
oh bay can i have the original one

707
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,639
can i have the linksys

708
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
do you have any old hack miami people

709
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
here like like

710
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,840
i wonder

711
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,080
no probably not we have the original

712
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
linksys with the percent 27 stickers

713
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,320
that don't exist anymore

714
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,678
somehow my husband ended up with it

715
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,679
so

716
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
um any favorite war stories on this guy

717
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,039
does anyone know who this guy is

718
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,880
our

719
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,440
wrdt54 the classic i mean like i know

720
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,039
it's a classic but i feel like i'm

721
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,039
talking to a 101 group who wants me to

722
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,679
like lead them through and i'm just not

723
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,520
there you know it was uh oh here it is

724
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,559
here it is

725
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,279
thanks baby uh let me

726
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
uh at least i brushed my hair for this

727
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,600
hold on where's my camera

728
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,799
i think one my thing is in full screen

729
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
it's not going to show me anyway but we

730
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,360
have the original one

731
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,520
it's crazy old so

732
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
when they distributed this linksys

733
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,279
router they distribute it with um

734
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,240
linux

735
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
and it's uh

736
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,080
well it's super flexible

737
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
it's a super flexible wonderful piece of

738
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
machinery that people could

739
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,039
use and manipulate and boost your

740
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,200
signals and do all sorts of malicious

741
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,240
 on

742
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,320
and um

743
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,559
after this comes out uh

744
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,320
you know the company kind of backs it up

745
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
on giving people flexibility with their

746
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
programming and their routers

747
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
um

748
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,799
there's a link

749
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
to the i think it's a

750
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,840
vice

751
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,240
all about this all about this hardware

752
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
super cute it's old at this point people

753
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,960
do still use them

754
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,799
but like i don't know how it's

755
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,919
good times good times

756
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,760
so you could just basically

757
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
patch into this guy

758
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,840
change the firmware he can be caught

759
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,120
over everything

760
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,240
all right so

761
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,679
i think here's where the weird stuff

762
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,000
starts oh no okay all right so i stayed

763
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
these are your blinkies and your badges

764
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
this is this is where i would learn

765
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,039
honestly this is probably going to be my

766
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
next step is hitting my def card badge

767
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
for this year um i know most of the

768
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,039
hardware stuff on the defcon badge this

769
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,760
year let me zoom into oh there we go to

770
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
the back

771
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,919
um

772
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,360
you know it's a don't stop the signal

773
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,919
thing like if you look um

774
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,240
can you guys see my mouse no you can't

775
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,760
the guy with his mouth open and there's

776
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,320
a binary code above his head there's a

777
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,799
little pill there you're supposed to

778
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,640
oh spoiler alerts in case you're

779
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
actually going to do this yourself

780
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
spoiler alerts

781
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,400
yeah but if you haven't looked this up

782
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
already i don't think you're gonna so

783
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,919
anyway you gotta like follow the signal

784
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,240
there's a pill here there's one um down

785
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
in the bottom left hand corner as well

786
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,360
and uh basically you desolder one pill

787
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,679
and solder the other and that changes

788
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
the path of the signal and when you're

789
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,440
plugged into your computer and you've

790
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
got your programs running it'll give you

791
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
the next step of the code

792
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,679
uh the next step of the code is to

793
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,640
connect the et finger

794
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,360
you know the e.t michelangelo

795
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
finger uh to the space needle or to the

796
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,679
ground because it's just the space no

797
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,159
it's just a ground anyway um

798
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
yeah and that gives you the next signal

799
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,360
so

800
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
this is a great place to start because

801
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
one it gets you used to interfacing

802
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
between your computer and a board

803
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,960
um

804
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,559
and again like i said about the con

805
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,480
badges they get you together with other

806
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,399
people who are interested in looking at

807
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,200
it

808
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,360
did you just drop hacker boxes you did

809
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,760
okay i love hacker boxes too

810
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,000
hold on sam says

811
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,109
[Music]

812
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,600
yeah

813
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,919
but that router was um

814
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,919
that router was a classic sam if you

815
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,440
want to take a second to explain the

816
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
glory of it you guys can do it better

817
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,559
than me

818
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,440
um

819
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,960
these are just things that i found on

820
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
the rabbit hole of what is hardware

821
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,760
hacking

822
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,240
just in case sam samuel wants to say

823
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,080
that the open wrt is just it was just

824
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
the original

825
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
it was a very good router for what it

826
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
could do and it was people could figure

827
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
out how to do it

828
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,559
uh i mean they they do have some modern

829
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,200
5g variants in the network wrt also

830
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,520
called like wrt like i use in

831
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,840
i think it's an open then and open the

832
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,360
wrt 1900 acs acs and whatever so they do

833
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,240
have more modern fi fi fifth generation

834
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,039
wi-fi ones with the firmware

835
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,679
that the fcc requires lockdown isolated

836
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,360
so you can still edit the device

837
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,640
so

838
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,399
what are the benefits of being able to

839
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,279
edit

840
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,640
edit the device like what are the cool

841
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,320
things that you can i mean while i say i

842
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,919
have another one right or like they'd

843
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,440
like have a netgear

844
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
the netgear equivalent to the

845
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,760
54g would probably be the 3700 i know it

846
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,600
was a workhorse a lot of people were

847
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
working with including me

848
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
the advantages have a you have a router

849
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,520
that's five to the extent you can do it

850
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,159
is when some of these are 10 year 10 15

851
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,919
years old at this point aren't they and

852
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,679
there you you can still get modern

853
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,840
updates for them to the extent that you

854
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
haven't overflowed the available storage

855
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,880
space on the device

856
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,559
so you can

857
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,799
so you can put mesh networking in them

858
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,640
it's very common to see mesh networking

859
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,679
put on these devices or

860
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,919
if you want to install pretty much

861
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,760
anything linux on them that fits they

862
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,360
can

863
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
i mean i mean one like that one wouldn't

864
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,880
have usb ports but newer devices would

865
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
actually i don't know if the 54g did but

866
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
the netgear i referred to does and

867
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,600
they're

868
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,640
i mean i have the 1900 version has a has

869
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,679
usb 3 on it

870
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,919
you're kidding

871
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,000
so you can then attach so it's basically

872
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
a device and you can then attach so if

873
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,200
you want to plug this you you want to

874
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,080
put have your networking device do file

875
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,320
sharing it can

876
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,600
or

877
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,399
is that

878
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,600
oh man is um

879
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
uh jax are you here is that how he made

880
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,320
his pirate box it was just a box that he

881
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,159
used to carry around then it would just

882
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,279
you could leave something or take

883
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,480
something we'll use something or take

884
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,240
something it was always powered always

885
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
on and it was just this tiny signal 15

886
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,559
20 foot radius or something like that

887
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
and it could also have been a raspberry

888
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,559
pi in that case but yeah i think either

889
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,320
use the wi-fi pineapple or a raspberry

890
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
pi

891
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,799
it's so fun i miss him i hope he's

892
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,159
coming around the winter y'all better

893
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,159
come the winner half professional

894
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,760
if you're willing and able to be in

895
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
person i think it was a pie but it was

896
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,360
like

897
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,399
yeah that thing was cool um

898
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,200
all right yeah the

899
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,039
do we have interest in making a hack

900
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,360
miami uh mesh network i thought we

901
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,120
talked about it at some point how close

902
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,279
do we have to be together to do that is

903
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,880
it a couple miles or is it less than

904
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,159
that it's probably less than that

905
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,760
it would depend if you're trying to

906
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,480
operate under amateur radio rules or

907
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,399
yeah or if you're trying to operate

908
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
within the fcc

909
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,159
allowed output of a device like that and

910
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,080
how directional you can point all those

911
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
antennas

912
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,799
okay right

913
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
i think it's one watt limit for for

914
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,360
wi-fi you'd have to start getting into

915
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
like microwave links or amateur radios

916
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
he's saying

917
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,720
like a principal there is one amateur

918
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
radio group that has a link

919
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
runs a wi-fi link all the way from

920
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,640
from delray beach to florida atlantic

921
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,919
university and that's how they get

922
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,039
internet

923
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,360
that's awesome no it's

924
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,320
tough to remote shack yeah

925
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,760
that's awesome

926
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,600
can you drop do they uh do they have a

927
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
link or something where we could take a

928
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,039
look at any of any of that could you

929
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,799
drop it in the

930
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,360
we got all sorts of great stuff

931
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,799
like i know the link exists i don't know

932
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,240
if they formally comment about it

933
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
anywhere i think actually two amateur

934
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
radio groups to get their internet

935
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,199
through florida atlantic university

936
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,880
but that's pretty

937
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,240
i think it's personal i think it's

938
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,919
overkill but it's just where they were

939
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,360
they couldn't get

940
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,840
dsl or anything where they put repeaters

941
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,559
also uh check out linus tech tips had a

942
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,720
video he's done two of them on uh like

943
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
prosumer grade or um

944
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,080
directional like linked link microwaves

945
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,200
so that you can get like a few

946
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,519
kilometers distance on like i think

947
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,760
ubiquity makes them

948
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,919
um but again it's it's overkill and

949
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,440
their point to point you have to have

950
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
you know line of sight from from one

951
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
tower to another so

952
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,799
it doesn't make sense

953
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,039
hook up your cantennas people

954
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,919
right

955
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,840
you have those those silly what's their

956
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
name which you're playing with uh

957
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,279
the

958
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,480
low speed

959
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,640
mesh networks and trying to load the

960
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,399
planes the laura's yes yeah yeah

961
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,480
yeah i came across

962
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
in my

963
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,840
in my in this rabbit hole of looking and

964
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,279
i was just like

965
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,120
i'm not covering anything that has to do

966
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,399
with radio

967
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,919
i'm not doing anything that has to do

968
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,960
with that because i know we've got

969
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,480
experts in the group that are coming up

970
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,399
with a talk for that for the next round

971
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,320
and i'm like i'm gonna learn

972
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,840
about that a little more before i

973
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,159
even touch that with a 10-foot pole

974
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,760
with my cantenna

975
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,919
i've given two talks on it and it is a

976
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,480
rabbit hole don't go down it

977
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,240
can you just give a quick quick

978
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,519
explanation because i know there's a lot

979
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,279
of newbies on here that what is laura

980
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,799
real quick and then

981
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,159
and then i know you're planning on

982
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,679
something for later or i don't know if

983
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,039
it's you or someone else but i didn't

984
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,880
want to step on that talk

985
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,279
uh laura i'm not giving a talk on it but

986
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,679
laura is basically just a a low power

987
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,000
wide area network and i think it's based

988
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,880
on

989
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
they're all open like imf frequencies i

990
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,879
think it's based on four four four three

991
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,800
three megahertz

992
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,119
um you see them used a lot in things

993
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,119
like uh i think

994
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,719
i think they use them in what are they

995
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,560
called like those energy meters

996
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,719
um and and other devices but they're

997
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,159
pretty low bandwidth but the nice thing

998
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,839
is that they they have a long distance

999
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,359
and pretty low power requirements

1000
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,520
well that's what's up all right folks so

1001
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
this is definitely something that we can

1002
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,199
we can expound on some more um

1003
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,040
all right so back to the blinkies and

1004
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,639
the badges which is about where i'm

1005
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,560
comfortable because i uh

1006
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,159
i love those hardware arts and crafts um

1007
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,440
and then i just gave you a little piece

1008
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
of what the terminal would look like

1009
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,760
how to reset the buttons oh god i love

1010
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,040
tindy

1011
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,719
tindy anything

1012
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,839
they've got to be somewhere in this

1013
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,480
presentation

1014
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,119
all right ah

1015
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,800
so this was actually the first thing

1016
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
that i was going to do because my

1017
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
courage is broken and so i figured hey

1018
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,800
let me hack my craig and then

1019
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,920
i started my master's degree so um this

1020
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,720
is some other dude hacking his correg

1021
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
and he also will go to the next step of

1022
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,400
plugging the water into a water source

1023
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
that's forever on so that but you still

1024
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,560
have to put the little k-cup in you

1025
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,920
still have to put the cup in so i'm kind

1026
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
of like unsatisfied with this hardware

1027
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
hack but it's it's don't let me talk

1028
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
 it's actually a really good hack

1029
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,440
and it's

1030
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,320
he made his career wireless

1031
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
so he just like signs on to a little

1032
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,720
website in his morning and like presses

1033
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
like initiate and the courage starts

1034
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
brewing but he has to put the cup in the

1035
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
night before um and then he wired it up

1036
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,119
so that he no longer has to put water in

1037
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,800
the tank but that it's hooked up to a

1038
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,280
permanent water source as well

1039
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
and um yeah so it's pretty cool um you

1040
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,440
still have to put the cup in at the end

1041
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,599
of the the night uh

1042
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,000
so that was the only hang up and um

1043
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,440
honestly it's beautiful and it's a

1044
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,200
brilliant hack so now his courage is

1045
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,560
wireless and there's a link to i

1046
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,040
you not like 20 pages of directions on

1047
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
how he did that and i went through them

1048
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,720
and it's

1049
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,640
the you got to have patience to be in

1050
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,000
hardware hacking because it's not i'm

1051
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
telling you right now it's probably not

1052
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,839
going to work the first time you plug it

1053
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,599
in there's always a something there's

1054
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,280
always something like a resistor you put

1055
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
on backwards and you can't really put

1056
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
resistors on backwards but like stuff

1057
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,480
like that like and then you gotta go

1058
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
through your steps and uh okay wiggle

1059
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,480
every wire make sure you didn't

1060
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,560
bridge anything or have any gaps

1061
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
anywhere did i program it you know so so

1062
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,480
just a little bit of patience in

1063
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
yourself

1064
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,200
what button down

1065
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,760
no it's a joke you know like you said

1066
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,200
have you tried turning it off and on

1067
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,760
again so no i'm joking because i was

1068
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,520
like oh am i on mute oh god that

1069
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,720
would be the worst i've been talking for

1070
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,599
like three minutes now so

1071
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,040
we i i

1072
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,119
i know every single one of you

1073
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,680
has felt that moment in the last online

1074
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,440
year of oh i've been on mute this

1075
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
whole time so

1076
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
oh here we are

1077
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,680
here we are folks we've made it to the

1078
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,839
1980s hardware hacking which i got to

1079
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,520
tell you

1080
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,359
people love this stuff

1081
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,599
people are not in the community the the

1082
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,560
most

1083
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,520
die-hard people that i've met get the

1084
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,280
most excited about this kind of stuff

1085
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
like people who have like

1086
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,440
phds and or whatever you get for

1087
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
electrical engineering that makes you

1088
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,240
like

1089
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,320
the at it i don't and they look at

1090
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
this stuff and they're like oh my god

1091
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,240
it's so cheap so she didn't even

1092
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,560
hack the bear for this one

1093
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,680
she

1094
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
she so she i want you to just take a

1095
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,480
look um this is a snip from the youtube

1096
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,240
which was as creepy as you think it's

1097
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,400
gonna be by the way it's actually as

1098
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
creepy as you think it's it's worse it's

1099
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,839
gonna get worse from here folks we're

1100
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,000
only going downhill from here

1101
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,359
um so she's got it it's like a a

1102
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,960
three-track

1103
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
cassette tape

1104
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,280
reader writer basically is what that

1105
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
thing is and um i want you to take a

1106
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,119
look at the cassette tape in the bear's

1107
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,400
lap

1108
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,520
and i just said that sentence

1109
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,359
i'm getting my master's degree folks

1110
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,720
take a look

1111
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,599
at the cassette tape and the bears

1112
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,560
those two little uh holes on the sides

1113
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,000
though the ones that are far left far

1114
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,520
right if you tape over them it lets you

1115
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,320
tape over the tape so what she found out

1116
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,359
was that

1117
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,520
when you look at this tape there's a

1118
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
frequency there now there's a track for

1119
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,359
the

1120
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,839
for the audio like what the bear is

1121
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:48,720
saying

1122
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,119
there's a track for the music you know

1123
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,200
the background music and then there's a

1124
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,000
track that is inaudible that makes the

1125
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,920
bear's mouth move

1126
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,599
so if you only record over the part

1127
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,839
that's the bear's audio you can make him

1128
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,680
say whatever you want

1129
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,839
with the music behind him

1130
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,680
well you i guess you can record you

1131
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,480
could have the bear be like

1132
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,000
you know what let's not get weird folks

1133
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,359
okay so you know what you can make the

1134
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,280
bear say whatever you want by recording

1135
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,040
over the proper track and as long as you

1136
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,200
pay attention to where

1137
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
the the audio signal is for the bear

1138
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,520
to flap his and he blinks too

1139
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,599
it's a double freakiness yeah he flaps

1140
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,280
his mouth he opens his mouth and he

1141
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
blinks um

1142
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,720
as long as you

1143
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,160
get up you know you make the bear say

1144
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,880
whatever you want and he does now other

1145
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,680
people have gone a step farther and you

1146
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,079
can also get teddy ruxpin hacks there

1147
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,240
where they have integrated a raspberry

1148
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,000
pi because there's a hole in his back

1149
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,079
where the cassette tape goes so some

1150
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,320
people have pulled out the cassette tape

1151
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,720
hardware like entirely and just

1152
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,599
integrated like their own audio speakers

1153
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,680
and everything into the back of the bear

1154
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,599
and then you just put a shirt

1155
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,480
you just

1156
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,880
close it back up um

1157
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
and he says whatever and it's it's it's

1158
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
truly creepy it's truly horrifying um

1159
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,119
yeah so i i linked you to that video

1160
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,920
there

1161
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,680
um where you can watch the entire

1162
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,960
process

1163
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,160
of her

1164
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,880
and

1165
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,960
she's really like a normal looking lady

1166
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,359
too it's quite it makes it worse

1167
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,040
um in my opinion yeah

1168
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,599
and um this was a 2 a.m find this was

1169
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,359
too and i'm never up till 2 a.m like i

1170
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,119
told you guys i've been um i've been

1171
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,079
sick

1172
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,560
so i've been up late doing my school

1173
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,000
work and my own research for this and um

1174
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,560
this is what happens when you mix

1175
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,200
circuit bending uh circuit bending is a

1176
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,040
whole

1177
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,160
weird awesome music a lot of music

1178
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,280
a lot of that

1179
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,160
since

1180
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,359
music that

1181
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,240
hardware that defcon is all about it has

1182
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,000
a lot of electronic stuff in the

1183
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,920
background that's circuit bending

1184
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,960
um

1185
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,760
so people took like the circuit bending

1186
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,480
plus the teddy ruxpin and furby hacking

1187
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,800
and this guy is actually he's actually

1188
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,359
kind of he's really he's really freaking

1189
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,280
cool man he does this with like a

1190
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,760
gameboy wall too like he circuit bends

1191
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,680
all sorts of electronics like honestly

1192
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
like it's his day job so like yay for

1193
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,040
him like

1194
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,240
live your

1195
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,280
live your bliss bro um

1196
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,960
it's kind of creepy that that's what

1197
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,560
this dude's bliss looks like though

1198
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,800
because it's an organ of furbies and i'm

1199
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
it the videos that i've got here they

1200
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,240
don't the video doesn't play i just have

1201
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,400
a screenshot for you but what he does is

1202
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,640
he integrates the mechanics of the furby

1203
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,800
into the synthesizer and when he plays

1204
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,119
it they all sing on different pitches

1205
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,440
and they open their eyes and mouths and

1206
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,839
this is not the only furby hack this is

1207
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,160
just this guy's furby hack

1208
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,599
and there are so

1209
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,480
so

1210
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,119
so many others

1211
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,000
yeah

1212
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,440
it gets real dark

1213
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,240
um

1214
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,400
and all of this is hardware hacking um

1215
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,560
the raspberries you definitely want the

1216
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,240
raspberry pies and the arduinos because

1217
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,839
they offer you um

1218
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,319
a lot of accessibility and they're cheap

1219
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,880
um but everything from the duckies to

1220
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,240
the the gas tanks to the

1221
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,319
the blinky batches and the furbies it's

1222
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,160
all considered hardware hacking which um

1223
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,560
i basically found out when i started

1224
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,839
researching it's like giving a

1225
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,599
presentation like what is hacking and

1226
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,680
it's like okay here we go

1227
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,839
you know it's its own it's its whole own

1228
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,119
branch so

1229
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,200
um i have links to

1230
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,440
oh yeah special thanks i download all my

1231
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,640
slide templates from this place called

1232
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,319
slides carnival i figured i'd keep it in

1233
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,240
there because they wanted me to um and

1234
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,839
then bunny at

1235
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,359
the defcon hhv village is my hardware

1236
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,000
guru and he's helped me design the

1237
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,839
winter hacker festival badge that we

1238
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,119
gave out a couple years ago it was a

1239
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,520
real simple circular

1240
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,560
pretty little

1241
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,359
purple pcb that had six blinky lights on

1242
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,160
it and a battery and um we that was the

1243
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
first thing i had ever

1244
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,200
that's the first board i had ever

1245
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,480
designed and it was really a cool

1246
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,400
process and he was going to help me with

1247
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,680
that and he's the one that helped me

1248
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,640
today

1249
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,079
um

1250
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,200
so um

1251
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,359
i don't know if you have questions or if

1252
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,680
you'd like to throw those in the chat uh

1253
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,839
if you'd like to organize a hack miami

1254
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,839
mesh network that'd be cool i'd be down

1255
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,480
to aim an antenna at some of you

1256
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,359
and um i put also links to some of the

1257
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,040
articles that i found that really helped

1258
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,319
me because um a lot of a lot of hardware

1259
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,400
hacking is also understanding electrical

1260
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,560
engineering and i kept a lot of that

1261
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,160
stuff out of this presentation for i'm

1262
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
not gonna lie to you for one reason me

1263
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,720
explaining that was real rough and i

1264
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,440
would rather hold off and explain it at

1265
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,599
a later talk when i understand it better

1266
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,440
than to come in here and try to explain

1267
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,119
to you the

1268
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
the benefits of the difference between

1269
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,319
serial and parallel bit transfer like

1270
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,480
because it gets like that so

1271
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,160
um

1272
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,000
are there any things that i can answer

1273
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,680
or help y'all with before we go ahead

1274
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,880
and break i'll make sure that this

1275
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,640
presentation the pdf version is

1276
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,800
distributed through our discord so that

1277
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,319
you can clicky all the links if there

1278
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,240
was something that you liked that you

1279
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
wanted to find but please make sure that

1280
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
if there's a link in the chat

1281
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,359
um

1282
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,200
oh that's what's up yo i'm glad that you

1283
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,280
learned something um come to our

1284
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
meetings we've got experts in every

1285
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,040
field next time i give a talk it'll be

1286
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,599
on uh osenter essie when we're ready for

1287
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,040
another one of those

1288
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,920
there's a whole new suite of uh

1289
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,680
tools in that field that have been

1290
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,119
released because

1291
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,040
you know businesses get smart services

1292
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,960
get smart they start blocking you know

1293
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,720
how we search you gotta you know you

1294
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,079
gotta come up with new ways so there's a

1295
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,200
whole new

1296
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,680
world of that so i'm happy that this was

1297
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,880
um

1298
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,359
yeah discord uh respeto can you drop the

1299
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,160
discord link again and then i'll um i'll

1300
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,800
send respedo or rod the uh pdf version

1301
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,160
of this

1302
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,960
um

1303
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,560
and it should have all the links active

1304
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,079
and all that good stuff so that you guys

1305
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,160
can click around see what i saw and i'm

1306
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,079
sorry about that because i'm telling you

1307
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,800
2am furby organ was a little bit

1308
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,960
the stuff of my nightmares now and you

1309
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,480
know what's the weirdest part i didn't

1310
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,560
even hate it i kind of was vibing on it

1311
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,319
that's the weirdest part

1312
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,920
i couldn't even be mad at it i was like

1313
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,960
okay this guy is actually

1314
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,760
pretty decent with this furby organ it

1315
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,280
was cool and he's got a game boy he's

1316
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,960
got this it's a whole youtube channel

1317
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,240
it's kind of sick

1318
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,839
so

1319
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,319
yeah all right more more details to come

1320
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,599
on winter hacker festival and um

1321
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
thank you all for

1322
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
going down that weird hardware hacking

1323
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,240
rabbit hole with me

1324
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,160
thank you for uh the presentation

1325
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,760
any questions

1326
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,480
this is the time

1327
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,079
also we also do have the

1328
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,560
hardware channel and the learning and

1329
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,440
help section if anyone wants to

1330
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,720
