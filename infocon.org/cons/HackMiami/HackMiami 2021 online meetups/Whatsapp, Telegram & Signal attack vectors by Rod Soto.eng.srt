4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,280
of hack miami co-founder

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,480
of president of pacific hackers in

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
san jose california and uh today um

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
yes the recording will be shared will be

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,160
posted in uh

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
youtube um so today

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
uh i'm gonna talk to you a little bit

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,560
about whatsapp signal and telegram

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,679
attack vectors

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,079
um the reason why i did this this

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,120
presentation is

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
obviously i'm interested as a researcher

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
myself and i want you to understand that

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,120
what you're about to see today was done

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,920
in a research environment and it was

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
done within the confines of the law

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,960
nothing illegal will be shown here just

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,239
in case you were looking forward there

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,039
will be some

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
things are very very interesting um

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,079
and there will be things that you

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,360
probably didn't imagine you could do

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,239
with these things

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,920
these things are public knowledge uh

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
yeah i'm seeing a lot of uh um

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
curious names today right uh so um

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
uh i think you guys are gonna learn a

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
lot just like i did

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
um and uh it's important that we pay

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,600
attention to this

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,360
because um the

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
a lot of the usage of users

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,960
are is moving towards

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
um mobile applications and and people

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
nowadays have their lives in their

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
phones so

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
consequently it's not strange

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,159
or odd the attackers are focusing

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
on the most used applications uh we also

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
have a contextual

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,479
um i guess variable which is the

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,000
the recent events uh within

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
uh not only the the update of the

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,280
facebook

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
uh privacy policy but also we

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,840
we now have uh censorship because that's

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,880
what i believe it is

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
uh censorship of certain apps uh in

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
uh the app stores uh the other

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
the you you you have much of a of choice

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,959
by the way you either google

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
or apple you have a little more choice

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,000
if you have

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
um google because you can you can steal

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
stuff from unknown sources

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,879
um and uh i'll talk to you a little bit

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,680
more about it i

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
actually did some research on it uh and

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
and it will give you a little bit of

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
fysa what's going on i feel

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
to give you a little context that

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
it's very unfortunate what happened with

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
the censorship uh and how the world

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,800
is not just america the world perceived

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,239
the closing of this apps

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,879
and this has generated a full movement

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,519
um

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
and you'll see it in just a second you

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,040
see how things are evolving

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
it's very situation right now it's very

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,800
fluid

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,840
and you will see a lot of new things in

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
the upcoming months

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,400
most of it had to do with people skewing

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
or avoiding american apps

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
and it's unfortunate that the silicon

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
valley have placed themselves

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
in that situation so let's get started

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
see here right here

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
if you can see this um well please let

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,840
me know

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,720
uh questions at the end please all right

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,159
so

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,879
here we go so this is this is my webpage

88
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,239
this is where you can find me and

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,519
contact me

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
um who i am i've been in the industry

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
for more over a decade

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
years has spoken pretty much everywhere

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,239
been

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
quoted or spoken many of the media have

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,599
a ton

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
of search to which at this point i don't

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,439
even consider relevant placing them but

98
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
i do i still keep them

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
um so uh i could follow the pacific

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,280
hackers

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
miami um so

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
here let's let's let's start with

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
placing this from the situational

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,200
perspective this is

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
a uh something that i took for hootsuite

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,320
uh

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
a report of a digital user on the world

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,880
so as you can see there is 5

109
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,840
billion again 5 billion

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
users in the world

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,840
and there is a total population of 7.6

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
billion so that tells you

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,919
how important is the mobile usage and

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,880
how important

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
is the mobiles as a tax surface

116
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
it's not only a personal attack surface

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,639
it's a corporate attack surface as well

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
because corporations are doing either

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
people

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
or they're or they're still some of them

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,199
are still issuing devices

122
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,479
you can see there that mobile social

123
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
media users

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
is around 3.2 billion

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
so this is very important this is

126
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
something that you have to consider

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
uh and understand from the perspective

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,600
of

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
what is it that we're looking at right

130
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
and many times here in america we we

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
have a

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,320
i guess a bias uh perception and we just

133
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
think that our apps are

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
the universe and they're not uh so

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
let's move on here's a breakdown

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,560
of the most used uh messenger

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
which is what we're focusing today

138
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
messenger uh uh

139
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
applications to the underworld so you

140
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,559
can see whatsapp is the king

141
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
facebook messenger is actually very

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
popular in the united states

143
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,440
uh and then you have other applications

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
um including telegram uh i don't even

145
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
see signal here signal is is up and

146
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,639
coming

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
but but it's not really there yet

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,039
um so here's to give you a

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,319
a perspective of how widespread is the

150
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,840
use of this messenger

151
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,638
applications

152
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,319
so whatsapp telegram

153
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
and signal are in my opinion for the

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
context that i

155
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,919
am doing this research in the united

156
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
states the most popular

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
messaging applications um they provide

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
multimedia messaging talking picture

159
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
video voice and text

160
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,039
this applications uh they obviously they

161
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,520
process

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
a huge amount of data and in that amount

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
of data there's a lot of sensitive

164
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,039
information

165
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
uh depending on the on the uh

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,120
your phone uh and the permissions

167
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,639
uh these applications can be considered

168
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,599
high risk

169
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
and can be considered high risk because

170
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
some of them can

171
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
access things that may not be

172
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
enough to take over a phone but enough

173
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,759
to

174
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,520
extract sensitive information like your

175
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
contacts uh

176
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
a lot of your metadata your your ip

177
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
address your geolocation

178
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,800
um and your interactions

179
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,599
um and what i was trying to say is that

180
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
the phone has become the ultimate crown

181
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,880
jewel

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
uh when you're targeting a persona

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
because uh pretty much all the lives

184
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,880
are recorded within uh

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,479
these devices um and

186
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
if you obtain which i will show you

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
uh and what we're about to to see if you

188
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
obtained your the phone you can

189
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
compromise the persona you can

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
you can do many things to harm this

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
person or completely understand

192
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
the interactions uh the the family

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,599
circle

194
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
family of friends colleagues everything

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
that you need about this person

196
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
okay so let's talk about whatsapp

197
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,039
whatsapp

198
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,080
is owned by facebook uh claims around 2

199
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
billion users around the world

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,759
2 billion is available in 180 countries

201
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
60 languages before recent

202
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
privacy fiasco whatsapp was estimated to

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,840
have around

204
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,039
one of every five

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,919
u.s adults so consider that one of every

206
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,240
five u.s adults

207
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
use whatsapp that was before the the

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,360
the problem that they have with uh the

209
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
issue that they have with the update of

210
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,840
the progress

211
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,599
privacy policy um

212
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
it's estimated to be used around five

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,279
million

214
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,479
uh number in in in

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
the in the sense of uh businesses the

216
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
biggest market of whatsapp

217
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,800
is india 340 million users

218
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,839
um it's proprietary uh

219
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,240
it's code it's not open source it has

220
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,680
been blocked in cuba

221
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
russia syria iran and north korea

222
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
some of the whatsapp features they have

223
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
end-to-end encryption

224
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
they use voice calls video calls

225
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
file sharing group chats and they do

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,519
have a step verification

227
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,720
that protects the users from uh

228
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,080
account hijacking which is something

229
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,040
very popular we're about to see

230
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
telegram so let's talk a little bit

231
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
about telegram intelligent was founded

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
by the same founders of

233
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,360
the rush the russian bk which is a it's

234
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
pretty much a facebook loan

235
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
um their headquarters in dubai

236
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,120
they they claim around 500 million users

237
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
and this actually places them ahead of

238
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
twitter in popularity

239
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
uh telegram is certainly the leader in

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,839
very specific markets it wasn't iran

241
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,560
until it was

242
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
blocked and it's open source telegram is

243
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,240
a

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
very interesting app from the research

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,920
perspective

246
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
telegram is almost an alternate and you

247
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,200
will see

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
why there is some information going back

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
and forth suggesting that the russian

250
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,079
government

251
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,760
may have the keys of telegram um

252
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,320
that may be true that maybe not uh it's

253
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
also true that the

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
the founders of telegram had been had

255
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,880
had their own

256
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,320
fallouts um with

257
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
uh the putin government so we had to see

258
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
um it's there's some we had to

259
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
look at that information with uh from

260
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,440
different contexts

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,959
here are some of the telegram features

262
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,560
um

263
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
accounts linked to a phone can be

264
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
accessed from multiple devices

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
it has a web interface it has a two-step

266
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,640
verification

267
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
it has a secret chat end-to-end

268
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
encryption you have to select it

269
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,360
uh web messages are encrypted by a dsl

270
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,079
dls and ssl uh that creature the

271
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
encryption key obviously said the server

272
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
uh it has possible channels so basically

273
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,760
if you

274
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
join telegram you can actually search

275
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,600
for channels and then you can join these

276
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,399
channels

277
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
some of these channels are

278
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,760
um some of these channels are um

279
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,839
uh a uh

280
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,240
places where you can just watch and some

281
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,519
others you can chat

282
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,200
so um telegram has become

283
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,480
uh give me a second okay

284
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,880
so some of this uh channel uh channels

285
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
have become very popular

286
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
and there's been a uh quite a very

287
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
number of new channels

288
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
since the issue with facebook as they

289
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
claim they have

290
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
um around 500 million users now

291
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
um there are other things that you can

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
do in telegram as well there are

293
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,079
links and files that you can actually

294
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,800
browse so

295
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,839
like i was saying before telegram is

296
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,560
almost an

297
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,600
alternate is its own thing

298
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
and you can find pretty much everything

299
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,839
you want

300
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,440
everything um they do a good measure

301
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,600
of moderation

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
but uh in certain ways telegram has

303
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,600
become

304
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,040
the alternative against silicon valley

305
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,240
silicon valley is now censoring blogging

306
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
at the the store the app store level um

307
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,959
i actually saw that the founders of

308
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,440
telegram are actually even having plans

309
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,279
and how they're going to do

310
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
in case they get censored i wouldn't be

311
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,120
surprised if in the next months

312
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
we have a third alternative to

313
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680
google and apple because simply

314
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
users do not like what happened i mean

315
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
it's very clear to me i want to see it

316
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
in every single net

317
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
um and one alternative they want to do

318
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
what they want to do and they

319
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
they um they want to choose what they

320
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
want to see regardless

321
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
if the users that take

322
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
action in these platforms are malicious

323
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,760
or benign

324
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
uh they do want to have the alternative

325
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
so so telegram

326
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
without any doubt is it's an app to

327
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,600
watch

328
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,839
uh they already there's people um

329
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
there's people there's some non-profits

330
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
that are already suing

331
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,000
uh to have telegraph then they're

332
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
already prepared

333
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
for a ban they're gonna they're gonna

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
have you um

335
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
they're gonna have you in stock from

336
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
unknown sources um

337
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,720
and uh this is the future we're gonna

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,440
have

339
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
we're gonna have a future of apps that

340
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,279
are not

341
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,560
uh may not be approved by big tag

342
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
but they will be installed somehow

343
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
someway through another meme

344
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
this is what's happening there's a

345
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
reason why there's the splurge of

346
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
new discord channels and new telegram

347
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,199
channels

348
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,079
uh this did not happen by accident this

349
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
happened for a reason

350
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
so um like i said before if you're a

351
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,839
researcher

352
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
a telegram is is is there's a lot of

353
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,399
material there's

354
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,320
all kinds of stuff and um telegram has

355
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
vulnerabilities i'm going to show you

356
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
some of them uh

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
in the next lights there is actually

358
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
a feature of um

359
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,519
telegram which is people nearby and

360
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,040
people nearby will tell you if you

361
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
choose to do so

362
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
it will tell you who's close to you and

363
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
it will allow you to message them

364
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
there are some risks with this as well

365
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
so i'm going to show you

366
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,320
uh

367
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,449
[Music]

368
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,079
uh in a few in a few slides um

369
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,959
they use symmetric encryption via the

370
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
emperor

371
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
which is their own protocol and they use

372
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,519
20

373
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,639
20 56 bit cymetric uh aes encryption

374
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
uh telegram has been blocked in russia

375
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,519
iran china pakistan um so

376
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,519
again i'm not ready to make a final

377
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,639
judgment on

378
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
on on uh the

379
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,959
if the russian government has their keys

380
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,839
or not

381
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,519
because there seems to be a lot of back

382
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
and forth between them and the owners

383
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
but again uh i personally would not use

384
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
uh telegram for my private stuff i do

385
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
use it

386
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,079
which i would suggest you for it on this

387
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,760
presentation use it for research

388
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
use it as a burner don't use this for

389
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,519
for private

390
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
um purposes and i'm going to show you

391
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
why because i'm going to show you some

392
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,120
exploitation tools that can reveal a lot

393
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
about you

394
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,120
all right let's go and say no signal

395
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
was founded uh co-founded by moxie manly

396
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,480
spike

397
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
many of us uh no moxie monks he's always

398
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,000
been

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,519
a uh like him or not he's always been an

400
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,639
advocate for privacy um and he's always

401
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,000
been an advocate for

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
uh uh secure communications

403
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,880
uh so um this is an app that is right

404
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,360
now

405
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
uh considered the most secure there are

406
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,680
some vulnerabilities i'm going to show

407
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
you some of them

408
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
uh but um

409
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,920
in in in

410
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
in general this is the app that

411
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,040
that i that i will consider more secure

412
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,639
at this point now remember this

413
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
um signal um is is very

414
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,040
flat all what they do is you communicate

415
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
you communicate you can do groups you

416
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
can do calls but it's not like telegram

417
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
tell them you can actually

418
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
uh have your own links uh have

419
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,120
files um there are different

420
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
uh obviously there are things that you

421
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,959
win things that you lose in terms of

422
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,560
privacy but in terms

423
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
of if you're trying to do secure

424
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
communications

425
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,560
and end to an encryption signal is the

426
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,440
way to go

427
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
right so uh let's move on uh

428
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
this again it's been blocked in iran

429
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,399
egypt

430
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,599
uae uh and qatar or was blocked at one

431
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,319
point

432
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,520
um and it's the least popular of all of

433
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,919
them

434
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,400
um they calculate approximately around

435
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,679
20 million users

436
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
uh they've been having some issues um on

437
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:16,880
the

438
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
uh on the escalation of users it's

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,079
natural for

440
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,280
a uh an app that is growing so fast and

441
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,079
i'm

442
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,119
really looking forward uh of the signal

443
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,400
growing

444
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,559
i'm sure they're gonna blame them soon

445
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,320
and and say that they do encryption and

446
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,000
they help terrorists with some

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
bs just like they they would with other

448
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
people they have sensors so pay

449
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
attention to this

450
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,640
uh because i i don't think we're out of

451
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
the situation guys i think it's it's

452
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039
going to continue

453
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,000
all right so in signal features um

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,520
end-to-end video calling

455
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,080
messaging and texting guru calls up to

456
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,039
eight people

457
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,120
automatic nrn encryption that's pretty

458
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
good uh

459
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,640
not by the phone on um uh telegram

460
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
uh whatsapp is good with that and

461
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,320
end-to-end

462
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
whatsapp use is actually signal protocol

463
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
and it actually whatsapp is

464
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
is is in that sense is reliable um

465
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,360
that they use the metadata at from one

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,640
end to the other

467
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
to do other things it's a different deal

468
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,559
but but for what i've researched

469
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,400
as far as the end to end is is private

470
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,160
um uh one of the features that they have

471
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,720
and became popular and is being adopted

472
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
now by other platforms

473
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
is the message timer so you can

474
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,600
basically

475
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
write a message and said um i want this

476
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
deleted in five minutes

477
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,960
uh the encryption uh is by a signal

478
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,679
protocol

479
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,640
that combines a double ratchet algorithm

480
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
three keys an extended triple divi

481
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,600
helmet

482
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,919
x3dh handshake he uses curve

483
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,160
255.19 aes256 and

484
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
hmac uh 256's primitives

485
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,559
uh and for those of you who are crypto

486
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,520
cryptography

487
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
experts um awesome

488
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,360
uh for many of us we kind of understand

489
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,000
what this is

490
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
but it's hard to get to the to the uh to

491
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,080
the detail

492
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,840
every each one of them um

493
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
signal relies on a centralized server

494
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
and this server uses

495
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,679
register users contacts for discovery

496
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,039
and exchange for keys

497
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,400
and uh the keys are renewed when a

498
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,760
um when a user changes phone

499
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
the it will warn you it will tell you

500
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,600
hey um

501
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,200
the the the session uh

502
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,640
key has changed you need to renew it um

503
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
so this is some of the features of

504
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,679
signal

505
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,320
so now let's do a basic security

506
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,880
comparison between these

507
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,280
three apps right from the data

508
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,399
collection perspective

509
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,840
signal does not collect any data only

510
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
phone number

511
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,799
telegram collects your name

512
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,440
your phone number your contacts your

513
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,720
user id

514
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,840
and your ib address

515
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
and website collects a dom you i will

516
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,600
show you

517
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
how much they collect um

518
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
the cost signal free no ads

519
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,679
telegram free no ads um and whatsapp is

520
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,320
free

521
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,760
i actually remember when i started using

522
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,240
whatsapp uh before it was acquired by

523
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,919
facebook i actually pay a dollar used to

524
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,880
cost a dollar

525
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
they they don't charge anymore um

526
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
are they open source signal yes four

527
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,120
open source

528
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,799
uh telegram some parts of the code

529
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,240
telegram are actually

530
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,799
uh open source and whatsapp is

531
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,400
completely proprietary

532
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,240
uh in in terms of encryption um

533
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
signal protocol it offers full

534
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
encryption end-to-end

535
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,440
uh telegram uh they they have the improv

536
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,919
uh which is not a grid does not encrypt

537
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,760
end-to-end by default you had to select

538
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,400
it

539
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,679
uh in in whatsapp they use the signal

540
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,640
protocol

541
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
um but remember cloud backups are not

542
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,679
encrypted

543
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,440
why you have to worry about this because

544
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,799
if somebody hijacks

545
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
your account which we're about to show

546
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
and you have backups and they download

547
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
those backups now they have all your

548
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,000
media

549
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
you know your messages so be careful

550
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
without

551
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,000
with that i actually personally i i

552
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,480
don't

553
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
i don't i don't back up any of my

554
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
website conversations or media

555
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
if i lost it i lost it um but that is at

556
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,080
risk

557
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,960
definitely uh from the mfa perspective

558
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
all of them

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,320
have incorporated to factor because

560
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440
obviously uh

561
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,919
the hijacking and stealing of these

562
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,760
accounts has become very popular

563
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,600
um and then the disappearing messages

564
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,159
um signal and telegram have it and

565
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
what's i'm supposed to apply it soon

566
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
okay yeah about whatsapp i took this

567
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,280
from forbes

568
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,840
so here's the the um

569
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,280
here's the uh the a comparison i took

570
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
this from forks again

571
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,799
of the data that's linked to you

572
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,080
according to messages

573
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,039
or signal or what's up so here's the uh

574
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,520
the data that's linked to you uh and

575
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
what's up

576
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
uh and as you can see that's a lot

577
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
uh that's a lot and i understand what's

578
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
up listen i like what's up

579
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
and i i feel like whatsapp is an

580
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,280
incredible business tool

581
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,159
but i certainly not i don't feel

582
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
comfortable

583
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,559
uh in terms of the pro a privacy of

584
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,640
privacy for for an end user and

585
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,159
uh um and and i just don't

586
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,520
don't grasp uh the the

587
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,840
the need to have all this and give this

588
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
to their body

589
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,360
that then we'll sell it to who knows and

590
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
that's where the danger of this comes

591
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,200
we don't have any certainty of uh

592
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
where is this information where is this

593
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
information going to be solved

594
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
um you're now combining the facebook

595
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
conglomerate right now you have facebook

596
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,600
snapchat uh messenger uh

597
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
whatsapp guys uh i worked in silicon

598
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,679
valley

599
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,240
and at times you get proxies you get

600
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,600
companies that they look

601
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,039
you know they look great on paper

602
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,960
whatever and they happen to be proxies

603
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,159
from foreign governments

604
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,640
they might be even buying this type of

605
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,679
information

606
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,760
and helping fis for the intelligence

607
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
service to uh

608
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,640
prey on americans or any user by the way

609
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,039
which

610
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,600
the funny thing about this guys is that

611
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
you may be avoiding censorship

612
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
for example in a country where you're

613
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,880
being persecuted

614
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
and then because of this possibly

615
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
you might be able to be to be given this

616
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,600
information that may

617
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,799
affect users on a third country

618
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,720
because of the amount of info that these

619
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,400
apps collect

620
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,480
so in that sense i would say it's a high

621
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
risk right

622
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,960
and and i'm saying this responsibly i i

623
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,159
think there is a risk

624
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
uh i i facebook doesn't offer a

625
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
transparency

626
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,279
uh reporter says this is who we provided

627
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,640
data they don't say that and the only

628
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
reason why this happens because we have

629
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
wisdom progress

630
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
so we have a right to distrust

631
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
we have a right to question what are

632
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
they doing with all this data right

633
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,520
even though i love like a hot face i

634
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,080
have

635
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,360
um whatsapp i know people on facebook

636
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
uh they have incredibly brilliant people

637
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,520
they have people that are good at heart

638
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
they want to change the internet make

639
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,520
good

640
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,640
however i'm sorry that leadership

641
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
doesn't seem to follow

642
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
that direction and and and the presence

643
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,600
that we have

644
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,880
with this application are very worrisome

645
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,120
so i i don't blame when a lot of people

646
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,799
say hey i don't want to use this anymore

647
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,679
i'm going to use single

648
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,039
so uh it seems like there's a lot of

649
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:07,520
questions

650
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,400
guys we'll get to them in a few i like

651
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
that you guys are excited okay

652
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
uh all right so

653
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
uh it's almost uh 240. so look

654
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,960
here i made a compilation of these are

655
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,840
not

656
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,480
the entire universe right of

657
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
vulnerabilities and exploitation

658
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
but these are the ones that i personally

659
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,080
consider

660
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,679
the most relevant um because

661
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,159
they some of them are still applicable

662
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,520
and i'm going to show i'm not going to

663
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,880
do a live demo i

664
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,720
already do screens in sanitizing but

665
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,600
i'm gonna show you why some of these

666
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,799
applications

667
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
you have to be careful with them they

668
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
are actively exploited if i was able to

669
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,279
do that

670
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,400
anybody can do that um and

671
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,919
um let's go over a little bit

672
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,279
of um what i found right

673
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,480
from the from the whatsapp perspective

674
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,679
uh uh you have the previous link

675
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,400
previews

676
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,799
right by the way this is not a new

677
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,600
technique

678
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
uh i've seen this

679
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
to attract people basically they send

680
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,000
you uh they attach

681
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,120
is some sort of a dot or a graph that

682
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,159
sometimes the the

683
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,440
the the aim user does not see but this

684
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,240
graphic

685
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,200
uh calls a server and then you are able

686
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,600
to

687
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
do your ip address is given away

688
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,080
um the link previews have been shown to

689
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,039
do that

690
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,360
for uh whatsapp some of these have been

691
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,159
fixed

692
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,400
and have been are being addressed right

693
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
now some others

694
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,880
were addressed in one place

695
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,279
correct ace link previous iron discord

696
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,559
too that is correct

697
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,000
um and uh i will show you screenshots

698
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
because i found this myself

699
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,279
um and then uh some others

700
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,640
if you if you know where to look you'll

701
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
still find them uh

702
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,200
invalid characters there was a uh an

703
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
attack where you send it a number a

704
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,440
bunch of

705
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
number of invalid characters it will

706
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,840
crash the app uh

707
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
then uh there's a those are buffer

708
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,960
management

709
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
issues and memory buffer issues uh

710
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,000
management

711
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
uh issues at the at the app level uh

712
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,799
the qr hijack which we are gonna show

713
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,600
today

714
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,520
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna show you a demo

715
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
of it works

716
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,480
actually works pretty good um there is a

717
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,120
way

718
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,240
when you sit call forwarding uh that you

719
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,760
can have

720
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,240
remember this in many of these attacks

721
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
you have to have physical possession of

722
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,799
the phone

723
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,399
if you don't have physical position of

724
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,919
the phone some of these attacks and

725
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,440
simply not possible

726
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,520
so for example there's one where if you

727
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,559
are able

728
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,760
to use um call forwarding

729
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,880
and use the call option on whatsapp

730
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
you actually will be able to connect to

731
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
the session and see everything

732
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,559
they're typing you have things such as

733
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,600
the otp sniffing right

734
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
the one-time password which is basically

735
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,279
uh

736
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,799
at times they even i read in places that

737
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,080
they will even try to see

738
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,200
uh if the person has for example the

739
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
the warnings or the messages that pop up

740
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
in their screen

741
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
and then with that register another uh

742
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,039
account or open it or or open a

743
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,159
different session

744
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,039
um and i'm going to show you at the end

745
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,760
because it's

746
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,399
i i saved the best for the end uh

747
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,399
instead of targeting these three things

748
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,679
just get the whole phone

749
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,919
and i'm going to show you a couple of

750
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,120
apps one of them

751
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,559
is open source one of them is private uh

752
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,240
it is pretty scary what they can do i'll

753
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
show it to you um

754
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,399
so be careful with the otp the otp uh

755
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,520
exactly exactly that's the way to go

756
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,640
um uh the otp obviously

757
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,200
there are many ways uh there are

758
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,240
recently there was

759
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,360
a instance where you

760
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,159
socially engineer the uh the victim the

761
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,840
victim

762
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,720
is pre-texted so the attacker already

763
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,200
knows

764
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,080
either a form they know either a person

765
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,960
they know

766
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
um this can be done by a face group this

767
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,080
can be done by

768
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
many things you can google and find

769
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
phones of the person

770
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
and then tell them hey you got this code

771
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,679
by

772
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,240
uh accident can you send me the code

773
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,360
obviously many people

774
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,600
deliver or not did and their accounts

775
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,799
were hijacked um

776
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,399
so uh we also had the uh

777
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,799
the cbe uh 2019 11931 which is

778
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,919
the buffer overflow on the uh an mp4

779
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,919
i was gonna i was gonna try to test this

780
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,000
but it was too old i couldn't get enough

781
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,919
a platform without to try where i could

782
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,919
try it um

783
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,600
there is again uh the assumption that

784
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,960
the founder of amazon may may

785
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,320
have been hacked by a buffer overflow uh

786
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,840
by a specific crafted uh exploit

787
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,880
for an iphone and whatsapp that

788
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,240
apparently had to do with some sort of

789
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,320
an image

790
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,399
i wouldn't say that this is impossible

791
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,919
we don't have proof if it happened or

792
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,200
not but i wouldn't say

793
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
i wouldn't discard it i think it's it's

794
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,039
definitely possible

795
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,000
you can also do uh voicemail which

796
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
basically and this is one of the things

797
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
they do

798
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
sometimes it's not difficult to guess

799
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,840
your your

800
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,679
voicemail password which is usually four

801
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,039
characters uh

802
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,120
you also have to do this when the victim

803
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
is pass out

804
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,880
or sleeping or they're traveling and

805
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,039
then with that verification code

806
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,240
they they proceed to hijack

807
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,520
the account uh and obviously if you

808
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,480
decided to back up your conversations

809
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,279
and

810
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,559
they're not encrypted they just come

811
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,120
down they have everything um

812
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,640
and then uh there were some chats that

813
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,360
were indeed

814
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
indexed and i'm actually gonna show you

815
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,600
some uh uh screenshots because i found

816
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,480
them

817
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,480
um so let's move on to signal

818
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,960
in signal we have uh uh

819
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,960
our first uh um

820
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
vulnerability uh most of these

821
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,399
vulnerabilities have been already

822
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:28,960
addressed

823
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
i don't have anything to show you today

824
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,320
per se about

825
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,799
signal exploitation-wise but this these

826
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,519
are some of the

827
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,960
vulnerabilities that i thought were

828
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
relevant and and if you had not

829
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,360
updated which i think is very difficult

830
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,039
because many times they force you to

831
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:43,919
update

832
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,240
uh you you had to take care of them

833
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
right so one of them has to do with dns

834
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,679
leakage which is

835
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,159
may indicate what what the person is

836
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,200
connecting

837
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,399
uh invalid character uh invalid

838
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,640
character or the idn homograph attack

839
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,880
sometimes has to do with the way

840
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,440
foreign characters are translated so it

841
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,080
may

842
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,679
say something completely different in um

843
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,279
in a foreign language but the way it's

844
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,720
translated it looks like

845
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,360
it's legit.com and then the person

846
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
clicks on it thinking it's legit.com and

847
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,279
and a lot of times this is a very good

848
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,000
vector

849
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,039
uh for uh for phishing um

850
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,919
and this has been used again against

851
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,880
browsers as well

852
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,039
there is a vulnerability for

853
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,039
2019 where uh

854
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,320
there was a signal desktop privilege

855
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,519
escalation

856
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,559
um and there is a

857
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,760
um the 2018 one which is that i

858
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
didn't want to go further than two years

859
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,760
uh where it forces the device to restart

860
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,679
so let's go now on telegram

861
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,480
so there is a telegram scraper i used it

862
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,200
it works

863
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,440
um and i'm going to show it to you in a

864
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,240
minute

865
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,799
um there's a telegraph which is

866
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,679
basically

867
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,120
a a code that steals

868
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,240
a a telegram channel that

869
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,559
allows you to steal a telegram channel i

870
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,600
saw the code

871
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
but i didn't want to i didn't want to

872
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,880
use it because i i

873
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,600
i don't i didn't feel necessary to steal

874
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,279
anybody's channel i just

875
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,919
uh researched it you can do

876
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,159
shadow sessions by malicious apps uh

877
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,159
basically it does not notify the second

878
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,640
session there are binaries and apks

879
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,919
there are apks that that may actually

880
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:40,799
target

881
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,840
uh whatsapp the iranians did this by the

882
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,240
way

883
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,720
um and you know again

884
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,640
you can have an end to end um encryption

885
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,559
but if i have like a uh

886
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,279
a key logger for example or i'm able to

887
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,480
own the phone

888
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,640
there's not much i mean i don't care i'm

889
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,840
gonna get everything typed

890
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,760
um so the uh

891
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,000
the telegram uh there's a telegram

892
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,040
channel stealer

893
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,320
which is another binary um uh

894
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
but again in some of these attacks you

895
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,719
have to you have to you have to do

896
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,159
social engineering you have to have the

897
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,320
victim or their target

898
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,679
open it and execute it right which

899
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,560
at times it's not it's not that easy um

900
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,199
there is

901
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,839
a a cbe or 2018 uh

902
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,760
177 which is basically

903
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
uh telegram desktop remember telegram

904
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,679
has a web interface like like we said

905
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,599
before the keys out of the server

906
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,839
and the the the messages are uh

907
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,639
encrypted via ssl at the ls

908
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
so it's really not uh end to end uh and

909
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,119
this can be targeted as well

910
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,560
um and there was a flow where

911
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,240
uh telegram desktop was actually leaking

912
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,359
using ib during calls um there is

913
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,640
actually a

914
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,599
bonding which i found is pretty really

915
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,800
cool and creative

916
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,160
there is something called a rat attack

917
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,720
which basically was a telegram based

918
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,160
bond net and it was abundant that was

919
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
based on telegram users um

920
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,240
uh and um it's

921
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,320
it's it's a very creative way of

922
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,160
creating a botnet

923
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,599
also there is something called the

924
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,359
katusha telegram which is

925
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,160
pretty cool it was a scanner based on on

926
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,280
arachne or

927
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
aknai whatever they want i don't know

928
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
how to pronounce it well

929
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,240
but basically what did what did this uh

930
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,280
what this did was it scan

931
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
if you're familiar with telegram you'll

932
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,480
see that there are links

933
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,280
so this was scanning all those links and

934
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,640
finding sql flaws

935
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,000
and he was telling you hey there is

936
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,240
there's there's there's an injection

937
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
point here there's uh

938
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,119
there is a uh uh this.x type of uh sql

939
00:35:59,119 --> 00:35:59,680
injection

940
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,280
at this um website so that actually

941
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,000
there's a tool that does that uh and uh

942
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,960
at one point they had a deep fake bot

943
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,000
which is also something uh uh

944
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
um i mean it's not funny for this to

945
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,520
happen right but

946
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,480
you you gotta you gotta give it the this

947
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,839
is somebody that had a lot of time

948
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,920
on their hand which was basically he was

949
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,760
scanning for pictures of women and then

950
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,520
it caught the uh

951
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
the the their face and then added to

952
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,960
a a different body um uh and that

953
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,800
happened that that's that would stop too

954
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
right so it's pretty embarrassing and

955
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,480
not nice

956
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,640
but this happened actually um so

957
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,400
let's move on so here remember that i

958
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
told you

959
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
that some of the links the conversations

960
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,560
were being

961
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,160
indexed and there you go there's one

962
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,960
uh you can see the number and you can

963
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,760
see what they were

964
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,640
trying to talk about

965
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,640
there it is if you actually look at site

966
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,839
awa than me steal and doctor though

967
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,200
they're still there

968
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
you can still find it that's this is a

969
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
vulnerability

970
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,400
and i wouldn't be surprised that this is

971
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,960
cash because one of the things that

972
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,440
the doctor go does is grabs from either

973
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
bing or google and then

974
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
puts in there and then they have to be

975
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,720
removed from those websites in order to

976
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,520
be removed from dot

977
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,000
though i just went through a a case that

978
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,480
i had to basically delete a link

979
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,320
and come to find that out

980
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,079
all right so here's the qrl hijack

981
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,119
so what you see here is me in my lap

982
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,400
uh basically what i did is

983
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
you you clone the the qr hijack

984
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,920
you create it creates has a php server

985
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
that emulates

986
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,920
the qr code you then need to send this

987
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
to the victim obviously

988
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
uh there is there is a part where you

989
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,839
have

990
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,320
to uh you had to compel or

991
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,320
uh or persuade the victim

992
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,079
to uh actually either scan it or click

993
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,359
on the link

994
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,960
and then this is what happens you you

995
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,480
mirror the the conversation

996
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,000
they might not even uh realize what's

997
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,440
going on and everybody's

998
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,640
reading everything you're talking to

999
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
this person in fact i

1000
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,400
had two burners i did this with two

1001
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
burners uh just to make sure

1002
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,400
uh uh that um

1003
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,320
uh you can get it done look

1004
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,440
i use this in an iphone i use this in a

1005
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,599
in an android and it worked there's the

1006
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,640
um

1007
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
there's the proof and i did it with two

1008
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
completely unrelated

1009
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,560
uh brand new no updates nothing uh

1010
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,839
and uh latest version of whatsapp got it

1011
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,839
as you can see i'm able to snoop

1012
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,680
in the conversation between this and i

1013
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
will be able to see all the

1014
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,599
conversations

1015
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,440
and media as you can see i i actually

1016
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,240
sent myself a picture

1017
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,440
to see if i could get actual media from

1018
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,079
uh the actual conversations as you can

1019
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,920
see there it is

1020
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,160
so uh there is another app by the way as

1021
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,240
uh that was developed on their own wasp

1022
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,560
there's

1023
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,920
always uh current hijacker i had issues

1024
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,880
um with uh because i was trying ubuntu

1025
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,760
20

1026
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
and uh i guess my libraries weren't

1027
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
right it was not working so i went back

1028
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,119
to this one

1029
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,440
uh this one as of now works um

1030
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,880
okay so it's no telegram so here's

1031
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,160
the demo for the telegram scraper so of

1032
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,800
course

1033
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,359
you know i wouldn't do anything to

1034
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,880
anybody i wouldn't do to myself

1035
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,200
so i decided to scrape my own chat

1036
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,320
well it's not mine it's our channel so

1037
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,839
um in this obviously

1038
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,480
you open the scraper right you have to

1039
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,599
create you have to give it some

1040
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,560
permissions there's

1041
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,160
there's some process there are things

1042
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,319
that i'm admitting here

1043
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,319
for obviously i don't want everybody

1044
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,839
going crazy

1045
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,280
after this uh presentation but but

1046
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,319
um basically look you're able to scrape

1047
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,640
everybody uh that is in the channel and

1048
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,800
then you can send in text messages

1049
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,720
check it out that's everybody

1050
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,359
that is in our channel or was the time

1051
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,040
that i

1052
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,839
scraped it and then i send it a message

1053
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,480
so does this tell you that maybe a

1054
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,960
nation state or an agency or a company

1055
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
with more resources may be able to

1056
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,000
link that metadata that we have on the

1057
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,480
left two actual phone numbers

1058
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,560
absolutely and i think the iranians

1059
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
actually did it at one point

1060
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,160
so be careful i just did this um

1061
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,599
so this this is valid this still works

1062
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,520
and this is a way to to uh

1063
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,880
basically identify because some people

1064
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,480
um by innocence or

1065
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,599
or or or naivete

1066
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,359
right they put their names

1067
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,520
so you can for example go right now

1068
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
choose a channel a scrape and you see

1069
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,119
names you see action names you can then

1070
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,119
google them you can research them

1071
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,480
right obviously i i sanitize everything

1072
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,839
but you can do this right now

1073
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,000
and it's getting crazy because this is

1074
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,680
becoming incredibly popular like i told

1075
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,160
you guys

1076
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,839
the telegram is the refuge uh

1077
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,079
of all these people that don't want to

1078
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,520
have anything to deal with

1079
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,359
with with the silicon valley tank

1080
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,680
and it's not just in the u.s it's

1081
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,640
everywhere

1082
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,839
i mean telegram is exploding right now

1083
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,319
so um uh there you have it there this

1084
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,680
this this this thing is

1085
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
really pretty effective again you can

1086
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,599
use it for fantastic use it for osint

1087
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,640
um you can use it for many things uh and

1088
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,720
it does work

1089
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,760
so wait i got more

1090
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,760
so uh

1091
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,359
so why you know instead of worrying

1092
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,480
about these apps

1093
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,160
why don't we just take over the phone

1094
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,240
right so i said

1095
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
instead of attacking the app i want to

1096
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,920
take over the whole phone right

1097
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,280
so here are a couple of tools that i

1098
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,200
research right one of them

1099
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119
is underwrapped which some of you

1100
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,319
already know

1101
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,119
uh it's a popular android trojan and

1102
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,520
then

1103
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,640
and then i tested the m spy and spy is a

1104
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,839
is a

1105
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,760
uh popular as well um surveillance tools

1106
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,839
for for kids it's it's all under the

1107
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,960
flag of

1108
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,319
uh protecting kids um

1109
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,520
and uh monitoring what they're doing uh

1110
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:05,839
so

1111
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,079
i'll tell you a little bit of uh what i

1112
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,359
found

1113
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,800
so underwrite i i've done it before uh

1114
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,400
here's uh as you can see instructed on

1115
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,720
my contacts

1116
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,760
um here is

1117
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,359
uh look you got my imei

1118
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,599
of the burner tells you the country

1119
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,000
serial number a bunch of other stuff you

1120
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,960
can send

1121
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,680
messages uh i know underwrite has

1122
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,359
actually plugins this is a version that

1123
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,160
i found

1124
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,280
somewhere on the web um

1125
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,760
so it still works i tested it on under

1126
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,040
android 9

1127
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,319
and stewart's um and uh

1128
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,400
this is a way of uh at one point it was

1129
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,359
very very popular

1130
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,000
and uh affected a lot of people you can

1131
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
get messages and

1132
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
get the android data send commands

1133
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,119
so this is for nothing it's free

1134
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,520
and then here's me

1135
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,079
testing the sms messaging you can put

1136
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,040
spam here

1137
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,680
you can put uh payloads you can do so

1138
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
many things with this so

1139
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,160
this tool still works uh if you have i

1140
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,839
would say somebody with a phone that is

1141
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,200
two or three years old

1142
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,560
which is not uncommon you could probably

1143
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,880
use this tool right there is there's a

1144
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,400
good chance that the updates will kill

1145
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,720
it

1146
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,040
or or the agent sometimes it's not

1147
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
working

1148
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,240
but uh definitely it does

1149
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,880
it does work right and then let's see if

1150
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,920
we go into

1151
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,079
this guys and spy and and spy

1152
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,440
is um

1153
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,480
is a tool for uh

1154
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,440
monitoring some people

1155
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,200
or his soul under the umbrella of

1156
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,160
protecting kids and this may as well be

1157
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,640
the

1158
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,280
the purpose of the developers uh but

1159
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,200
unfortunately like any great technology

1160
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,720
and this is a great tool you're about to

1161
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,680
see why

1162
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,520
uh can be used for malicious purposes

1163
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,280
right uh so i don't

1164
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,079
i don't necessarily accuse them

1165
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,040
i don't necessarily accuse them of of

1166
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,720
using this

1167
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,359
for malicious purposes right and i

1168
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,280
consented to everything you're about to

1169
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,520
see so i'm not blaming them for anything

1170
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,920
uh i actually think that their

1171
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,720
applications

1172
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,400
is is it's pretty cool

1173
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,400
um and what this type of tool does

1174
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,560
against everything like if you have an

1175
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,319
android phone

1176
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,839
just few things that you will not get

1177
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,680
from this like in this case you can see

1178
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,000
it i tested it on android 9.

1179
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,480
uh what you see to the right is the

1180
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
numbers

1181
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,359
that were called that were used uh it

1182
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:57,920
gives you

1183
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,400
the exact date it gives you the text

1184
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,839
messages

1185
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,200
they even have further more

1186
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,560
features when they can actually see

1187
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,640
whatsapp they can see snapchat they can

1188
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,280
see facebook

1189
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
they can actually detect if what are the

1190
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,640
wi-fi networks that the phone is at and

1191
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,000
you can actually block

1192
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
the phone from accessing the wi-fi

1193
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,640
network um

1194
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,000
here's some other examples

1195
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,319
here's uh me for example so i said

1196
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,319
i'm gonna i'm gonna set up an alert that

1197
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,640
every time i type hack miami

1198
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,280
in this phone no matter where it's gonna

1199
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,319
send me an email

1200
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,200
it works there it is what you see on the

1201
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,000
right

1202
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,480
is the actual alert when you see on the

1203
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,119
left

1204
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,160
is the filter that i created at their uh

1205
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,040
platform they do have a platform they

1206
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,200
send you the apk

1207
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,319
yes it costs money uh and

1208
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,880
uh but it's pretty effective i like i

1209
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,079
was

1210
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,839
surprised to see this you you don't need

1211
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,319
to you need to spend 500 a

1212
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,680
thousand dollars all you need is

1213
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,200
three to four minutes with

1214
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,560
target cell phone and this

1215
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,000
and if you're on the phone it's even

1216
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,040
uh faster the case is not the same

1217
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,599
for apple i tested it on apple too and

1218
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,079
it's

1219
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,040
not the the level of encoders to apple

1220
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,599
for

1221
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,960
by the way because apple uh was

1222
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,800
very restrictive and you can see almost

1223
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,160
anything i'm going to show you just in

1224
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,920
just a second

1225
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,280
so um you can track my keywords you can

1226
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,720
get all the pictures i think i have them

1227
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,839
here as me

1228
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,960
um extracted all the pictures

1229
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,000
uh that had in the phone gives you all

1230
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,960
the calls

1231
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,559
and gets your calendar show you the

1232
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,000
the the wi-fi networks uh install apps

1233
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,680
uh geolocation um everything

1234
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,160
everything this is like industrial grade

1235
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,760
uh surveillance

1236
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,000
um and one thing that i

1237
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,160
taught because i when i did set up

1238
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,200
this um i did not

1239
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,839
select and make it undetectable which

1240
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,200
was the last step

1241
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,520
uh there are a lot of stuff that i

1242
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,839
didn't put here for obvious reasons but

1243
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,640
um if you ever see something like this

1244
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,760
dude you are

1245
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,079
more than compromised uh there is no way

1246
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,599
to detect this

1247
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,440
there's just no way to detect this um

1248
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,839
and also i discovered that sometimes

1249
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,559
when

1250
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,599
the phone disconnected uh

1251
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,119
uh or or i turn it off um

1252
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,160
i will get an alert and you can you can

1253
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,880
actually send

1254
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,119
a a message to the target phone and it

1255
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,119
activates again so if you start seeing

1256
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,280
weird messages in your phone with

1257
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,599
like very long codes you may want to

1258
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,040
worry about it

1259
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,400
because that's that was a way to

1260
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,559
activate this by the way uh

1261
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,559
but this this application is incredibly

1262
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,160
difficult to detect

1263
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,559
if you're using this uh or if you think

1264
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,839
about using this

1265
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,680
because you want to monitor

1266
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,720
your child um i'm not going to say a

1267
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,839
a your partner because i think that's

1268
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,040
illegal

1269
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,160
unless you're on the phone but

1270
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,760
if you if you are i've seen cases

1271
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,680
i myself uh where um

1272
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,240
i saw a case of a person whose uh

1273
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,520
daughter minor

1274
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,000
uh was leaving the house two three a.m

1275
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,079
and then one of the things that the

1276
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,880
she was doing in order to avoid uh being

1277
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,559
tracked even with the normal fine

1278
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,319
friends or whatever that

1279
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,359
that you can use uh with the ios was she

1280
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,960
was turning off

1281
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,200
the cell phone and then the other party

1282
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,559
was sending in an uber

1283
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,319
so basically there was no way to track

1284
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,079
her on the until she would

1285
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,680
turn back up the phone which basically

1286
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,280
went she was coming back so kids

1287
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,480
nowadays

1288
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,200
are pretty smart uh and um

1289
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,559
if you have something like this uh which

1290
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,520
um again it's legal you can use it it

1291
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,960
depends on the way you use it you may

1292
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,319
get in trouble right if you're violating

1293
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,680
the privacy of somebody

1294
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,920
or you're installing it in an authorized

1295
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,280
manner

1296
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,400
uh this is uh

1297
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,040
this is commercial grade uh surveillance

1298
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
it's got everything you want this is

1299
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,680
this this

1300
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,000
is no i understand why they are so

1301
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,960
popular because

1302
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,119
it's a good it's a good tool if for the

1303
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,559
purposes that's trying to do obviously

1304
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,160
i'm not saying you should do this

1305
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,400
uh and i myself wouldn't do that i did

1306
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,200
this for

1307
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,520
uh research and because i was curious

1308
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,200
because i get constantly

1309
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,880
uh called rod my my my daughter is doing

1310
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,359
this

1311
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,599
my song i i suspect that he's

1312
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,599
meeting with people that are doing drugs

1313
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,599
or they're they're they're doing crime

1314
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,839
i need to know what's going on and many

1315
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,040
times they

1316
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,240
they feel like that their hands are tied

1317
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,960
um i still feel like there's a great

1318
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,839
area here

1319
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,040
and between privacy and uh uh

1320
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,440
trying to protect your your children but

1321
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,920
it's available it is there then

1322
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,680
i didn't create it and it's there and

1323
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,279
these things are becoming popular

1324
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,200
so here's the uh um

1325
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,640
uh i used the uh the apple so i actually

1326
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,079
got an apple phone all iphone

1327
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,920
and i said let's test it let's see how

1328
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,760
good this is because i was very

1329
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,480
impressed

1330
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,839
of what this tool can do with android um

1331
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,839
and uh i said let's see if it's that

1332
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:46,880
good without because

1333
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,280
we all know apple is harder to

1334
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,119
compromise and it's harder to

1335
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,400
to to to hack unless you you

1336
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,440
uh basically uh uh um

1337
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,000
your break the phone uh so the first

1338
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,960
thing i found

1339
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,200
which kudos to a boy and this is i was

1340
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,599
pleasantly surprised to see this

1341
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,200
um apple will not allow you to install

1342
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,839
this app

1343
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,880
unless you install it on your own

1344
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,599
so you have to install this app on your

1345
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,599
own phone before you can put it

1346
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,599
on somebody else's right which i think

1347
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,040
it makes sense to be honest because if

1348
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,319
you're saying hey

1349
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,160
i want to see where my kit is okay well

1350
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,680
then you should have it you

1351
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,599
uh yourself in your own phone so you

1352
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,440
have to authorize it

1353
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,480
uh you have to authorize it at your uh

1354
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,040
phone and then it sends you a link put

1355
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,760
it on

1356
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,640
the target phone um but it's not much

1357
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,359
you can get actually i can show you guys

1358
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,720
all what you can get is basically

1359
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,119
location and it has something called

1360
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,440
which is the sos button

1361
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,520
which you can press and it will tell you

1362
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,040
exactly where the person is

1363
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
but other than that you can you you can

1364
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,119
see context uh but you can see

1365
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,400
anything else uh really nothing else

1366
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,960
you can see text you can see what's up

1367
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,480
you can see

1368
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,800
uh all the other features

1369
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,920
i like keylogger none of that so

1370
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,240
again apple is and again

1371
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,040
this is this is uh they they're

1372
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,000
definitely

1373
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,319
uh highly uh secure in perspective of uh

1374
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,920
when you compare it with the things that

1375
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,240
you can do with an android uh

1376
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,960
off the shelf so um i was pleasantly

1377
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,599
surprised

1378
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,240
i i tested both of them uh for those of

1379
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,960
you

1380
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,119
who are like me security consultants and

1381
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,400
people sometimes people gets to you

1382
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
desperate hey i need something

1383
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,720
uh you get cases of people that go to

1384
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,200
foreign countries and get laws

1385
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,920
and stuff like that this tool is

1386
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,000
pretty effective if you're using it on

1387
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,559
android

1388
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,559
and with that let's talk about

1389
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,280
mitigation so this this are sort of uh

1390
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,040
sort of my uh uh what i after doing

1391
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,000
all this uh research and executing all

1392
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,880
these tools

1393
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,839
this is what i what i sort of concluded

1394
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,480
of

1395
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,200
ways of mitigating uh if these things

1396
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,480
are going to be used

1397
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,920
in a malicious manner uh against anybody

1398
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,920
so do not root uh do not jailbreak that

1399
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,880
should be

1400
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,319
uh a given if you're gonna root

1401
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,119
or jailbreak use a partner right if most

1402
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,240
of you guys

1403
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,400
are researchers like me uh don't put

1404
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,839
this in your phone

1405
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,480
um whatsapp is definitely great for

1406
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,680
business

1407
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,640
but not for privacy i'm sorry i i think

1408
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,000
i think that the

1409
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,520
whatsapp is going to have to either

1410
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,520
change or address

1411
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,160
in a different manner uh and actually

1412
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,440
prove us

1413
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,280
uh the way they're managing this

1414
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,040
information and and

1415
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,720
and who they're selling this to how

1416
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,160
they're using it uh

1417
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,599
so i usually tell some of my uh

1418
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,520
friends and colleagues and and and

1419
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
people that that ask me for help that

1420
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,960
you should never mix

1421
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,359
business with pleasure you should have a

1422
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,160
cell phone

1423
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,000
for business you should have a cell

1424
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,599
phone for private and never mix

1425
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,319
any of them don't mix the contacts don't

1426
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,160
mix the apps

1427
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,520
um and don't put sensitive information

1428
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,160
in your private sensitive information in

1429
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,520
your

1430
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,400
work or a business cell phone so if

1431
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,839
you're going to use whatsapp for

1432
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,440
business it's an amazing tool

1433
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,880
um it's a decision

1434
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,000
that you have to make if you want to

1435
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,559
continue using it i know people that

1436
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,880
you know my family i myself have friends

1437
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,799
and family abroad

1438
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,319
and i will continue using it i assume

1439
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,640
the risk but it is at risk

1440
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,839
and you have to assume it um you had to

1441
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,880
set up mfa

1442
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,920
at every sensitive application not just

1443
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,119
the

1444
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,200
the banks not just the uh healthcare

1445
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,240
uh everything set up mfa

1446
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,680
everywhere may save your day

1447
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,720
the iphone is still the most secure

1448
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,280
device uh as you can see it you just saw

1449
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,000
it

1450
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,720
um and this was me accepting everything

1451
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,240
i accepted everything modified

1452
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,000
permissions everything

1453
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,799
you can so this is proof and again

1454
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,000
kurosu

1455
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,440
that um probably the the device to

1456
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,559
to to that is most more secure at this

1457
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,520
point

1458
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,720
is the iphone unless of course uh

1459
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,400
you use nation state level uh payloads

1460
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,160
uh which cost a lot of money and if

1461
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,480
you're not really

1462
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,160
jeff visas or a governor or president

1463
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,319
very rather you'll be targeted by this

1464
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,880
um signal is

1465
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,799
the most private messaging application

1466
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,400
hands down you wanna

1467
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,799
you wanna protect your conversations

1468
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,480
it's the way to go

1469
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,160
um lock up your phone

1470
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,520
uh do not even show text on your screen

1471
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,720
when locked this means you know the otps

1472
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,280
when you get the otps back on the codes

1473
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,599
uh there are people you you don't know

1474
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,119
you know if you're in a bar or you're

1475
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,160
somewhere

1476
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,920
somebody uh bumps you is they

1477
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,040
is able to see the uh uh

1478
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,599
the otp code and and then you're in

1479
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:20,960
trouble

1480
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,280
uh do not install apps from no sources

1481
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,240
this is also a given um

1482
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,480
do not even open messages for unknown

1483
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,599
sources

1484
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,400
uh when in doubt factory reset and this

1485
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,760
car device

1486
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,880
and this is true if if i know

1487
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,000
how difficult was to detect this until i

1488
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,880
myself tried them and if i had selected

1489
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,799
that option to make it undetectable it

1490
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,440
would have been

1491
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,720
it would have been literally

1492
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,880
undetectable and the only way to get rid

1493
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,520
of that

1494
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,440
is by resetting the phone to factory uh

1495
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,160
factory research so when in doubt that's

1496
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,680
the first thing you need to do

1497
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,559
and depending on the situation you may

1498
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,839
discard it

1499
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,040
use cash create a different account

1500
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,400
buy a different different uh

1501
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,920
which may be you know i i seen some uh

1502
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,200
consultants that basically they

1503
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,280
themselves buy the funds uh for the

1504
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,160
victims so

1505
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,520
so so uh um harasser or

1506
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,720
or uh whoever is targeting them

1507
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,280
it takes them more time to find out what

1508
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,760
sort of new device they're using

1509
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,799
uh telegram is a very cool

1510
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,680
tool for research but i would only use

1511
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,119
it in a burner

1512
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,160
as you can see i'll show you today right

1513
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,119
i mean it can be more clear than that uh

1514
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:41,520
but

1515
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,040
pay attention to tell her i think

1516
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,960
telegram is going to places

1517
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,799
and uh it will continue to grow i'm

1518
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,839
positive they will

1519
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,160
um uh you need to activate

1520
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,880
my phone or equivalent and be ready to

1521
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,040
wipe it out if it's if it's lost or

1522
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,839
stolen

1523
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,880
that goes without saying you know

1524
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,680
whoever you go whatever you go wherever

1525
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,880
you spend the night at

1526
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,400
don't let your phone unload because

1527
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,280
many times that is the vector of

1528
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,960
installing

1529
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,599
this type of payloads uh do not back up

1530
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,040
your whatsapps

1531
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,400
uh if you still use it because like

1532
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,440
i told you before uh the the backup is

1533
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,400
not encrypted

1534
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
and if the account is hijacked the

1535
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,640
all the data will come down um

1536
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,280
keep the phone updated and you can use

1537
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,760
uh there are not gonna

1538
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,920
pinpoint specific products but there are

1539
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,680
some good products out there for

1540
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,720
for securing mobiles uh google fi is

1541
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,319
definitely

1542
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,400
the most secure phone carrier uh it's

1543
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,079
almost impossible to do a scene swap

1544
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,200
on google fi uh if you add the titan key

1545
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,240
by the way it's even more difficult uh

1546
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,720
to to do a scene swap or an account

1547
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,720
hijacked

1548
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,880
and again like i said before do not mix

1549
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,559
business with pleasure

1550
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,480
uh use a phone for business use a phone

1551
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,000
for private and with that

1552
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,599
i i think i'm done for now

1553
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,400
so um

1554
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,040
we can proceed with the questions if you

1555
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,440
want to

1556
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,200
thank you steve glad to see you man

1557
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:30,799
so let's see do we have a chat here

1558
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,079
okay briar i looked at bridge yesterday

1559
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,680
um in breer is um

1560
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,720
i haven't had time to actually research

1561
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,799
it but it seems like it's a p2p

1562
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,319
uh something similar was being used by

1563
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,799
the hong kong protesters and i think

1564
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,400
that bought them some time

1565
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,160
uh i think what they were trying to what

1566
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,040
the the government ended up doing was uh

1567
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,920
finding out the the board that the the

1568
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,200
app that we're using

1569
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,400
and blocked it um

1570
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,839
but i have to uh uh

1571
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,720
have to actually research all these apps

1572
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,520
uh

1573
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,440
like i said this is the result of what i

1574
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,040
said before uh

1575
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,599
there's there is there's there's a

1576
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,040
doesn't have a name

1577
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,799
but there is a movement to um

1578
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,079
to actually um stay away

1579
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,200
from from anything big that means uh and

1580
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,319
and it's not just

1581
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,559
in the u.s i'm telling you it's not just

1582
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,440
the u.s

1583
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,720
many people around the world so what

1584
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,319
happened and said uh uh-uh we're gonna

1585
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,000
create our own thing

1586
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,960
so so um expect this and expect you

1587
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,799
to have to research those things because

1588
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,720
eventually those things will affect us

1589
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:53,680
here you'll see any other question

1590
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,520
uh no i don't see anything uh

1591
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,960
a little bit about the state of android

1592
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,280
phones that go out of support

1593
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,319
yes they are they are a big problem uh

1594
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,200
because a lot of the payloads um some

1595
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,799
payloads that may

1596
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,119
um

1597
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,480
make steel valid you're exposed to them

1598
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,200
uh

1599
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,720
and there are not updates um

1600
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,839
some of the apps are indeed

1601
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,599
uh discarded they may not work or or

1602
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,960
they might be impersonated so i i

1603
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,400
wouldn't suggest to have a

1604
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,000
an out of date uh uh android phone

1605
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,079
unless it's a cut down i only use it for

1606
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,599
uh boys and text messaging and even then

1607
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,280
you know i'm sure there will be some

1608
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,720
sort of a a exploitation code found

1609
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,240
in all libraries or kernel

1610
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,039
how well do trollians get data

1611
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,720
partition phones um

1612
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,119
listen i used i have used my temperature

1613
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,000
before

1614
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,599
and you can get everything as long as

1615
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,920
you allow the apk in the case of android

1616
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,200
as long as you allow the apk to access

1617
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,960
or give them the permissions i was able

1618
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,280
to

1619
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,400
do this is how i know if you guys seen a

1620
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,720
a documentary that i did with cbs miami

1621
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,240
i was able to actually strike the actual

1622
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:22,880
pictures

1623
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,200
i saw the libraries i was actually going

1624
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,319
to look into

1625
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,440
extracting the key from whatsapp because

1626
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,680
whatsapp leaves the key uh in some of

1627
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,640
the folders

1628
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,720
but i didn't get to do it but it's

1629
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,319
something that is uh

1630
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:40,319
definitely good for for the research

1631
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,599
on the team of the centralized solution

1632
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,280
have you investigated

1633
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,799
any day ab blockchain base for secure

1634
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,319
messaging there was one

1635
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,920
there was also a um

1636
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,390
a wallet i had not really

1637
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,880
[Music]

1638
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,480
researched it the thing about blockchain

1639
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,000
is how you use it

1640
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,039
um because if if blockchain

1641
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,640
if you're gonna put the messages on

1642
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,400
blockchain

1643
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,559
it's not private that's going to stay

1644
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:13,680
there and it will be

1645
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,160
attributable to your no right

1646
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,680
so depends how you use this if you want

1647
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,839
to do it in a decentralized manner

1648
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:22,559
meaning

1649
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,839
you can take me down from the

1650
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,599
connectivity perspective

1651
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,240
and the and the nodes and anonymize then

1652
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:28,720
yeah

1653
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,359
absolutely i'm all for it uh

1654
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,400
lineage os you know third-party androids

1655
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,799
i don't know i haven't i haven't

1656
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,079
researched on that

1657
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,640
uh for me the the way to approach this

1658
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,160
will basically be

1659
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,760
install that os into any device

1660
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,799
grab a device install a uh that

1661
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:51,839
operating system

1662
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,640
and do a pen test you know use it look

1663
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,280
at the

1664
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,119
permissions look at the restrictions

1665
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,000
look at the the vlog the applications

1666
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,280
uh what is it doing where is it

1667
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
connecting and then from there we can

1668
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,799
take a look and see okay well if we had

1669
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:05,520
an app

1670
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,000
that did x y and z maybe this app will

1671
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,280
be able to do

1672
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,760
x things so um unfortunately i'm not

1673
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,160
there yet

1674
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,359
uh p irl has a message insisted i don't

1675
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,240
know about that

1676
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,880

we're always on uh let's see what we got

1686
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,640
from victor um

1687
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,440
what is the best mfa otp google

1688
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,440
authenticator

1689
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,280
google authenticator i researched on

1690
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,960
this before uh when i was

1691
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,000
uh when i was doing sms and

1692
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,599
and sim swap and google authenticator is

1693
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:16,240
the best

1694
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,160
alt has some issues they're probably

1695
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,520
fixing at this point

1696
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,039
uh but um microsoft also

1697
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,160
uh microsoft authenticator uh works

1698
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,760
uh what happens sometimes with those

1699
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,599
apps by the way

1700
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,000
is that uh and the hat changed because

1701
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,880
um

1702
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,559
the attackers found out that if like

1703
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,200
if i can keep pushing let me in let me

1704
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,319
in let me in

1705
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,160
uh then some people for example when

1706
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,079
they were lunch or dinner they just said

1707
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,119
yes

1708
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,720
so now you have to actually look at the

1709
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,960
number and match it in order to approve

1710
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,039
it

1711
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,039
see what else we got oh

1712
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,799
um that's a good point um

1713
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,079
the mfa's like juviki or

1714
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,200
or you can have duo or you can have uh

1715
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,640
the titan key

1716
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,960
uh from uh from google um

1717
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,240
physical tokens are great the physical

1718
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,839
tokens wear off

1719
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,119
they wear off and then they don't fit

1720
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,720
or they don't they're not detected that

1721
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,559
happened to me whether you wiki

1722
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,880
uh the where i was constantly doing the

1723
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,559
whole mfa and then at one point it

1724
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,400
wasn't detected uh

1725
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,839
i actually i'm that old yes uh i had an

1726
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,799
rsa

1727
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,920
real secure uh and i lost it or

1728
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,200
well tsa took it and uh

1729
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,599
uh then i got blocked from everything uh

1730
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,359
and another course i had to actually go

1731
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,880
to an interview in order to get a second

1732
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,000
token

1733
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,799
but yeah if you if you take care of them

1734
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:49,920
then you can use them

1735
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,559
by all means when you actually purchase

1736
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:53,200
titan

1737
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,760
they force you to have two which is cool

1738
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,960
they force you how to do

1739
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,280
because that way you have a backup if

1740
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,400
you lose your titan key

1741
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,039
see i'm trying to address your oh here's

1742
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,079
a good question

1743
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,200
uh aside from other countries are

1744
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,359
seeing a trend in the u.s to simply stop

1745
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,238
using some big tech platforms

1746
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:20,000
um is this like

1747
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,600
um what other platforms are being used

1748
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,238
uh

1749
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,359
in the light of what's going on i don't

1750
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,880
i don't see a a in a specific trend

1751
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,640
on what platform uh they're going

1752
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,359
i can see that there that's why i asked

1753
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,640
blue fox

1754
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,040
i asked chris to to do a presentation of

1755
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,960
this because we we need to have some

1756
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,880
context of what's going on

1757
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,158
where this is what happened

1758
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,000
after what happened with butler right

1759
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,080
right or wrong um

1760
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,000
many people went to other places but

1761
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,520
what made things worse

1762
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,799
was that apparently partner had all this

1763
01:08:58,799 --> 01:08:59,679
information

1764
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,238
that then exposed all these people right

1765
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:02,719
uh

1766
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,279
this was almost like the ashley madison

1767
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,198
where everybody was exposed

1768
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,000
right and so now i see more of a

1769
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,839
distrust

1770
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,000
of actually using this platform and

1771
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,960
that's that's

1772
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,719
in my opinion one of the biggest dangers

1773
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,000
of this that

1774
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,600
we have come to a point where people say

1775
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,040
you know what i don't want to deal

1776
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,960
anymore with any social media i don't

1777
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,799
want to know anything about this

1778
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:28,640
um and um one of the perspectives of

1779
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,600
that i can tell you

1780
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,560
if we if i had to choose on a specific

1781
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,238
platform where

1782
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:38,399
it's almost uh i would say 50 60 percent

1783
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,198
uh that people are going it's telegram

1784
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,399
tell them why because

1785
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,839
they perceive that it's outside of the

1786
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,719
united states and because

1787
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,640
it's uh there is not this uh perception

1788
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,640
that people are being observed censored

1789
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,158
the stuff that is being

1790
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,400
taken but as i show you uh i'm sure

1791
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,000
foreign intelligence services are using

1792
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,080
these tools to unmask

1793
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,600
and find out who's using it and saying

1794
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,520
what

1795
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,880
let's see let's just continue

1796
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,280
uh how realistic do you think will

1797
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,440
maintain linux based mobile os in the

1798
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,280
future

1799
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,320
yes um but again is

1800
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,679
is is a canon mouse game right

1801
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,840
you know uh windows for example in

1802
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,080
microsoft i had to give them

1803
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,080
kudos they had gotten much better at

1804
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,679
exploitation but they still get

1805
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:34,880
exploited why

1806
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,600
because there is that is what most of

1807
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,280
the enterprise uses

1808
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,239
and because of that then there are

1809
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,640
adversaries are putting resources

1810
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,880
time uh and money into that and

1811
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,480
eventually you will find a way

1812
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,600
to break into it it's it's saying that

1813
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,480
i mean well-maintained helps uh and it

1814
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,199
may reduce it in comparison to others

1815
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,560
however uh that that does not guarantee

1816
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,840
he won't be exploited

1817
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,040
and in fact i think that the likelihood

1818
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,480
of a platform to be exploited

1819
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,760
is its popularity and the value of who

1820
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
uses it and what they carry on

1821
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,440
so uh

1822
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,400
a workaround hold on trying to jailbreak

1823
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,640
my own iphone but when i go to all store

1824
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,600
and try to connect to my iphone yeah

1825
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,080
this

1826
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,360
this i this is probably out of the scope

1827
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,880
for this presentation

1828
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,280
but i i can i can give it a look

1829
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,440
afterwards

1830
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:42,239
uh if mfa is on your phone hold on

1831
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:46,080
if let's see if mfa is on your phone and

1832
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,679
you can access sites apps

1833
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,120
uh they lost it sorry

1834
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,320
uh you use them if they

1835
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,600
absolutely yes that's true

1836
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,640
bb yeah that's absolutely true that's

1837
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,360
absolutely

1838
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,760
when you when you do mfa in your phone

1839
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,199
that's not everything

1840
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,640
uh uh and uh if you have a if you have a

1841
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,560
a um uh and if you have used one of the

1842
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,320
tools like we just saw like an

1843
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,080
underrat or an empty spy

1844
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,760
that won't do anything by the way and

1845
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,760
there's other tools by the way like

1846
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,280
like evil jeans uh a much leshka

1847
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,080
uh that you know presented perfectly you

1848
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,280
know you won't even be able to tell

1849
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,600
is there any resource you recommend for

1850
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,199
comparisons on the security

1851
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,480
almost common current that are better

1852
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,640
a few issues registering with carriers

1853
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,840
for manufacturers like google pixel

1854
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,440
uh no i don't uh the best way to do this

1855
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,679
is basically go on the developer forums

1856
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,880
um do open source research and uh

1857
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,800
uh you do your own testing uh i'm sure

1858
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,080
if we work to get the the uh

1859
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,320
competitive landscape will get

1860
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,920
incredible info but

1861
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,960
it's not that easily available i'm sure

1862
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,560
you have to find it but there's not

1863
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,960
there's not a set there's not like

1864
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,239
there's no like cis benchmarks or or

1865
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:21,040
um any other type of maybe a miter

1866
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,480
attack or something that

1867
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,239
that will tell us hey these are

1868
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,040
performed and perpetual none of that yet

1869
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,360
