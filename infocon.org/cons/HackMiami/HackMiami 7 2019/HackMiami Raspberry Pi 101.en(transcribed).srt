30
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,500
all right so one of the things that

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,000
you'll notice the other slides there's a

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,450
whole bunch of information that thermal

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,450

00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:53,519
both certainty forwards but when I'm in

37
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:57,909
us resistors pastors soldering top

38
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:01,769
headers closer look one of them is an

00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:01,769
actual form computer and the other one

40
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:09,639
they have different cons so Raspberry Pi

41
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,010
can everybody see this or is it really

42
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:17,349
really super tiny and first generation

43
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:19,839
and a super tiny so basically yeah a lot

44
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,699
of information I'll share it in 2012 it

45
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,489
was designed device as an educational

46
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:27,009
tool that can help teach children to the

47
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,669
home and they wanted to load it up with

48
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:33,430
Python Java got the name pie and wanted

49
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:36,758
the price it around $35 so it could be

50
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,680
practically right so they were kids even

51
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,599
afraid to touch it to handle it

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,599
it's not a $5,000 if you

53
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,540
and basically

54
00:04:47,729 --> 00:05:00,449
I have a weekend here a minute sent me

55
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:04,379
here cool little vivid it and in this

56
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:07,620
life one of articles where you know he

57
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:10,949

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,710
okay so the Arduino 2008 it was worth it

64
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,440
it's an open-source prototyping board to

65
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:47,270
award the microcontroller so different

66
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,580
for the microprocessor that powers the

67
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,950
Raspberry Pi the Arduino can be easily

68
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,020
connected to bread boards where the pie

69
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,409
has its own operating system and can run

70
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,090
as a mini computer the Arduino hardware

71
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,690
that can source there's many different

72
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,340
varieties and additional components LEDs

73
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,980
will differentiate regulators and the

74
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,128

a huge kit

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,339
whereas the demonstrator microcontroller

78
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:26,649
and the micro processors of the Arduino

79
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:29,830
already has a 16 megahertz pot for you

80
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:32,080
two kilobytes of memory GPIO fans are

81
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,068
only 14 and the operating voltage of 5

82
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,619
volts the Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ clocks

83
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,289
at 1 point 4 gigahertz memory at 1 gig

84
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:44,439
and forty-fifth dominant and same

85
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:48,849
operating voltage out of the prize so

86
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:50,249
100 times faster than handling and we

87
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:52,430
have different statements

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,420
for and wanna read through that and just

91
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,440
efficiency

92
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,180
you should find a new things if you know

93
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,640
and it's microcontrollers would never do

94
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,340
but some applications full-fledged

95
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,140
full-fledged computers cumbersome and

96
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,380
unnecessary which is where you have the

97
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,000
breakout boards for the Arduino and

98
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,430
beyond today I mentioned a little bit

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,560
about the u.s. so you guys very high

100
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:25,180
rise with special version of Linux and

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,070
that usually refer to as Class B and

102
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,430
they also have adjusting and a couple of

103
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:34,570
others that I played with but on all the

104
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:38,260
ones that can happen here and around to

105
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,599
keep the lights flash forward is about

106
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,240

same way we will load up tailored mingle

110
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,100
or I would eat a little bit of a

111
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,620
compiler that we play with their costs

112
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,090
are going to be approximately 35 35

113
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:06,639
bucks the Arduino is

114
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:08,679
20:25 and being able to run programs on

115
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:23,740
that

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:27,570
but with it and so one of the things

117
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,570
that keeps people from getting into

118
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,558
don't worry too much about that because

119
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,809
there are

yes yet the Elsi interested in that as

124
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,730
well keep in mind to go to retro

125
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,860
Raspberry Pi foundation all the

126
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,259

sale in a book stores you can get copies

128

examples

131
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:17,160
sometimes they have a special ball where

132
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:19,770
you can get free with it all right so as

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,740
I said earlier I knew given purpose as

134
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,090
an educational tool or when we converse

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,160
with expect raspberry pi to support

136
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,220
health ring programming language and so

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,719
it does again I get different examples

138
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,550
here there I'm not actually built

139
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,430
anything from scratch on my own it's

140
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,709
using the examples and having fun with

141
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,959
those now our problem things that I have

142
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,259
done

143
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,469
I'll show you as I had the specific

formal camera with a 5-0 because it's

146
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:56,649
such a tiny footprint one here if I zero

147
00:09:52,819 --> 00:10:01,029
has such a footprint it makes for a good

172
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,200
Raspberry Pi to easily mount up here

173
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,700
however I have a a truss rods on about

174
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,690
Packer boxes really what happened right

175
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:43,970
one of those and I made a different

176
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:47,890
manner so we have a really cool

177
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,890
connected computer wireless

178
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,059
[Music]

179
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,279
[Music]

180
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:55,870
[Music]

181
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,870
the camera

182
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,870
u.s.

183
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,879
[Music]

184
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,830
[Music]

185
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,140
after camping

186
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:37,949
all right so which one is that right

187
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,079
so as we said in the beginning you may

188
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,269
not be a fool or f-35 I'll give

189
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,219
everything under the Sun just like to

190
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,459
work on a project right so my current

191
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,610
standard that works very well the rules

192
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:52,179
and your

193
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,009
that funding these projects and it is

194
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:57,089
build on these projects well because

195
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:57,089
that things that plug into

196
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,459
[Music]

197
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:08,220
and basically it just says they're built

198
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,220
to achieve vastly different consider and

199
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:25,230
[Music]

200
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:25,230
again we're going to

201
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,410
[Music]

202
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,700
[Music]

203
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:53,860
the library Wireless is a disaster so if

204
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:56,959
you want to break out to play welcome to

205
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:00,610
you guys we have some toys here if you

206
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,610
look at play with I'm going to want

207
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,569
[Music]

208
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,899
[Music]

209
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:24,708
all right so a couple of us should lay

210
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,839
out for you guys how many of you in here

211
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:35,909
are funny with raspberry pi stuff and

212
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:47,178
are giving this up alright so some

213
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:47,179
lessons learn what's not okay

214
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,570
okay couple of useful commands to the

215
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,490
Raspberry Pi and obviously Google these

216
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,240
as well but I put together a little

217
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,470
underneath sheets of cheat codes so the

218
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,900
one that you're going to get to know

219
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,280
most is pseudo graske conveys this is

220
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:22,000
where you're going to be able to give

221
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:24,580
your wireless and network as a base

222
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,700
turned on or

223
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:31,449
others Larry Teel use a lot there is a

224
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,420
movie interface as well however you can

225
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,250
do a headless install and let's go five

226
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,230
minutes in just a second and you can

227
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,100
actually just use SSH to get in as well

228
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:44,370
so a lot of the command line another one

229
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,370
here

230
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,339
[Music]

231
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,039
[Music]

232
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,729
[Applause]

233
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,619
[Music]

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,960
what's up with the passwords the default

235
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,780
installation for raspbian it defaults to

236
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,030
the UK so your time zone your language

237
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,280
including your keyboard layout so if you

238
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,649
type in the password without changing

239
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,970
those settings that passwords though

240
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:45,870
they're not gonna work I can show you

241
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:53,160
guys in the box a PI zero and then we

242
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:59,639
have the PI a 3 and B that's a hard

243
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:03,410
kernel oh joy right yeah three folks you

244
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,410
can put version of Android

245
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,239
[Music]

246
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,820
also in reference to keyboard we have a

247
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,600
really cool people are here that

248
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:24,340
Jonathan that that's nice most people

249
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,340
never use for that with the truck bed

250
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:31,379
[Applause]

251
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:36,469
I also have parents or that they

252
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,470
announce that on the side and white

253
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,330
there's a part question

254
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:59,280
nothing so far each dinner table with

255
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:02,070
the 5-0 team I plug in it will plug

256
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,430
directly into here if we get rare moshus

257
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,429
enough

258
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:19,309
so I show you have to play together

259
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,309
[Music]

260
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,350
so some other commands that we are going

261
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,750
to want to use change directories list

262
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,959
directories little file show contents of

263
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,450
a file and nano lots and lots of Nano

264
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,740
and rasp it config when you're in the

265
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,210
beginning and you just learning this

266
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,010
stuff you're going to use this over and

267
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,800
over again and as I said if you don't

268
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,840
set the country and keyboard in the

269
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,399
beginning you're going yourself as well

270
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:53,250
so you'll get a copy of this and a

271
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,400
couple of little projects the spycam

272
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,660
project now to give you my experience

273
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,759
with this I wanted to

274
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,759
[Music]

275
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:26,590
let me daresay okay so what we did was a

276
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:29,380
security camera spy camera project was

277
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:36,970
that was my learning ground for from the

278
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:39,429
air on the step out and so as I was

279
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:44,670
going through working on this I also

280
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,670
wanted to do a headless installed

281
00:22:54,550 --> 00:23:00,909
[Music]

282
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,469
[Music]

283
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:25,810
and playing with zero so pro tempore the

284
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,280
pi0 you are doing a necklace install and

285
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,940
I believe I have some instructions up

286
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:37,540
here in here somewhere

287
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:41,040
in the configuration part of it are your

288
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,040
headless install will not work

289
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:56,310
you haven't played with the pi0 yet okay

290
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:59,160
so with the camera our trips needed 5-0

291
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:01,700
an SD card with news everybody familiar

292
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,700
news

293
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,259
so new this is the nice little intro

294
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,119
just really gives you it's a pretty

295
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:14,579
little graphical user interface you plop

296
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,339
it in there get everything connected to

297
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:19,739
turn it on and it says start here and

298
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,809
you could which one do you want you say

299
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:23,070
I want grasping it and it goes up with

300
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,229
those at all for you so that's where

301
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,178
beginning to start right so you might

302
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:29,249
see alive

303
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,349
and you can do all that you can actually

304
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:35,969
download grassman and you can put the

305
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:38,460
full this room for asking problems so

306
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:40,019
that little things I was doing the noobs

307
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,399
make other than eating Porter way that

308
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,000
walks you through everything step by

309
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:46,639
step what country are you in

310
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,789
because as you said you don't set your

311
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:53,270
initial country code word color product

312
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:56,580
you're gonna be messed up and actually

313
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,129
we ran into problems because I didn't

314
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,360
know that

315
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,770
[Music]

316
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,419
but I just have a trunk with my keyboard

317
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:11,060
because I've actually set as the

318
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:14,210
keyboard like you need a camera or no IR

319
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:17,210
camera for the nitrous vision you also

320
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:21,260
need a smaller cable ribbon for the PI

321
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:24,040
zero so you'll actually cameras in

322
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,040
camera will work

323
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,159
but the regular start kicked out the

324
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,710
camera is my 27 box on Amazon

325
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,580
[Music]

326
00:25:49,710 --> 00:26:03,559
well alright first option we're getting

327
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:03,559
this camera and at pieces parts

328
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:17,560
all right so we have a 5-0 we have our

329
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,560
fire here and also have

330
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,700
the options for like GSM SIM card

331
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,929
they what they call the top hat

332
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,070
you can probably get that hacker box

333
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,190
[Music]

334
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:54,960
okay so first option that we are going

335
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:59,360
to work with raspbian stretch for point

336
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,360
2-1 there's lots of hiking

337
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,870
starting with a new in charge of the

338
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,700

while and I remember that being a

455
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,830
problem because it looks like 4 1 2 but

456
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,168
it's actually in hell so be very very

00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,569
ctrl 0 and control X to exit and then

459
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:56,319
you're going to install motion with the

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:59,059

top there's plenty of

472
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,690
you can do a streaming in-house you can

473
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:59,330
do streaming outside we have a couple of

474
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,720
what I've done is stream local host is

475
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:05,000
off webcam local host off webcam port is

476
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,779
80 81 right pick your own court doesn't

477
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,940
matter to me control local host off

478
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:22,160
control port 8080 stream max rate of two

479
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:25,070
to ten with the regular 5 you're going

480
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,100
to have more options than 5 0 is limited

481
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:32,710
right so that's why I have to go some of

482
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,710
these numbers into the pie

frame rate rates they can also do motion

485
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,779
detect right it's the motion detect in

486
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,609
here one of your options is motion

487
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:48,069
detector so you can have it one of the

488
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:49,720
ways to set up is if it's text motion

489
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:53,410
it'll take a picture and send that email

490
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,209
to me instead I'm gonna run screen for

a-and you get that working

a problem that you so start talking me

to twerk and then speak from there now

499
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,119
72 run the units run Damon first we need

500
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:12,049
seven motion five so again pursuit of

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:17,310
nano into the config file promotion

save and control oh and control X to

505
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:26,009
exit reboots and once it reboots you

506
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,619
should be able to open up a browser and

507
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:31,800
go to our report and can pick your board

508
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,109
I think address : 80 81 and see the

509
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,970
stream and taste the rainbow

510
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:37,828
now if you turned on a B and C and

511
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:40,020
possibly access eight you can also cut a

512
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:42,780
or B and C into your machine so that you

513
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,099
don't have to have a monitor and also

514
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,589
have the same

515
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:51,109
right here that is basically what

516
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:52,480
happened on the project now some of the

517
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,940
things that I can tell

518
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,619
happen to me so some of these exceptions

519
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,630
are in here because I had difficulties

520
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,280
you know who have indestructible out

521
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,410
there kind of doing that didn't

522
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,630
work for me right so I thought only easy

523
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:06,839
you know my workshop is like two weeks

524
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,840
away

525
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:17,328
[Music]

526
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:17,329
right

[Music]

531
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:32,040
so I want to put in new distros I heard

532
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,029
about the dish room is that part about

533
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,029
that endless install

534
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,480
[Music]

535
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:48,020
I turned off the buoy and I even started

536
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,799
everything

537
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:54,788
[Music]

538
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:54,788
gars still what

539
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,290
[Music]

540
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,089

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:38,538
[Music]

542
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,330
is it a patriot

543
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,069
Brian or Sanders

544
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:16,650
you can use a district called motion on

545
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,689
us and all uses download it and write it

546
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,880
up solve it and it just works every

547
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,100
single time your camera setup you can't

548
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,070
move it you can't really tweak it all

549
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,440
that much all it does most in iOS and

550
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,930
that is it only wants a couple of

551
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,820
instructions living here together in 20

552
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,160
minutes per month and I will tell you

553
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,270
that this piece of board that won't

554
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,759
run by a truck

555
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,970
it actually runs this so it's still

556
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,970
useful

557
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:26,699
[Music]

558
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,890
[Music]

559
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,879
all right once we have this we can

560
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:08,390
actually put it into i0 again having to

561
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,390
take a flip

562
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,849
[Music]

563
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,650
[Music]

564
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:17,410
some have a place for your backs and

565
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:20,769
another place with pins back here you

566
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:25,118
pop it in and this is one on top with

567
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:28,629
the camera and there's a add-ons that

568
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,180
you can do one of them that I saw is a

569
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:33,579
case that has suction cups from the

570
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:42,220
front of it so you can suction cup it to

571
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:45,359
your window use it as uh as what's

572
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,359
covered driving camera

573
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,280
[Applause]

574
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,170
some of the really cool projects and I'd

575
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:08,250
like to accuse him with the Raspberry Pi

576
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:10,770
is a type a peon plaque hole so afraid

577
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,450
her is ever actually tried though way

578
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,540
awesome so with the pie hole basically

579
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:17,939
you're turning a Raspberry Pi into a TNS

580
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,330
blacklisting so we'll put that on my

581
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,670
network

582
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,460
anybody who drops on my home network it

583
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:26,760
eliminates ads so whether it's my phone

584
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,650
tablet laptop it basically scrubs a lot

585
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,250
of the other titles that your laptop or

586
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:34,260
your device would get and with I'm

587
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:37,260
running a sheet pile and my VPN on the

588
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,790
same Raspberry Pi no problem when I beat

589
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,790
the end no matter where I am

590
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:56,599
network through the Raspberry Pi the

591
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:05,959
regular little blown Raspberry Pi has

592
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:10,509
anything important so so the best way

593
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:10,509
that I had like mine setup by using 453

594
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,729
exactly so you go to like the airports

595
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:18,709
whatnot I've got like oh we've got Wi-Fi

596
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:21,049
but it's paid Wi-Fi the one port that

597
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:23,149
they do a lot out is Deanna and port 53

598
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:24,979
so if you're tunneling through port 53

599
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,819
just looks like a lot of DNS requests

600
00:47:24,979 --> 00:47:27,439
are going through them through their

601
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:30,380
network traffic you know I need you're

602
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:33,098
actually on YouTube or every one way to

603
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,099
get around there

604
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,540
[Applause]

605
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:04,919
[Music]

606
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:10,299
give me the wireless LAN it does it take

607
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:13,540
up more power if you have a very slim

608
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,160
connects - yeah and then it's like

609
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,960
you're doing like projects like this you

610
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,839
can always try and do the headless

611
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,880
install so you don't need a GUI desktop

612
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,470
don't think that stuff on there that's

613
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,690
more resources that we will actually

614
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,730
consume and thus making your picture

615
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:32,400
sizes a lot smaller I've actually gotten

616
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,400
a full 1080p even a Raspberry Pi zero

617
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:57,859
[Music]

618
00:48:50,500 --> 00:49:00,040
that's basically distribution you go

619
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:00,040
ahead

620
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:09,170
actually if anybody needs any of the

621
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,020
images I brought most of the ones just

622
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:17,869
fresh off of the website this morning

623
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:20,089
yeah okay so is the motion iOS and

624
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:42,470
here's the instructions we just download

625
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:44,000
an administrator so alright so edger

626
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,529
windows everything we're doing here

627
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,669
today

628
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,669
[Music]

629
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:14,240
removing that that we'll look at here in

630
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:17,880
212 of ways yes they're already updated

631
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,799
crap my god yeah I've got the headless

632
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,270
I've got the full-blown I've got the

633
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,750
recipe and lights

634
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:26,850
I brought the there's a 8 bit basic

635
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,460
distribution orderly what anybody wants

636
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:33,540
to go back to the program to do their

637
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:36,870
basic I think I also grabbed a copy of

638
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:38,730
Kali latest versions of caliper arm

639
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:41,150
which will run on the Raspberry Pi so

640
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,150
again

641
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,850
I didn't come to help us install here

642
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:50,380
it's basically make sure you said you

643
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:53,960
are going to put wrap up footrest

644
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:58,330
raspbian upon the part and you are going

645
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:01,790
to definitely a supplicant config file

646
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:03,980
once you get in there things you've set

647
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:06,560
up easy way to do is just using notepad

648
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:09,320
plus bus you're going to put again this

649
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,700
is not touch this is so if you're gonna

650
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,200
put in the country I was put in the

651
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:18,980
country to have this installed won't

652
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:20,720
work without it update the big one is

653
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,180
when it boots out it looks for this file

654
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,259
when it finds respire the drops into the

655
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:31,120
right place I've been in my Wi-Fi router

656
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,120
and my SSID and my Wi-Fi password

657
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:42,139
[Music]

658
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,849
[Music]

659
00:51:56,449 --> 00:52:09,509
understate the file into the microSD

660
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:12,660
route as in every bar so this is the

661
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:15,029
motion is this full distribution right

662
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:19,410
here beside these instructions right

663
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:23,400
here require absolutely zero for any of

664
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:26,339
this so this is the quick and dirty

665
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,280
version and again no I do not include

666
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:30,570
that

667
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,940
[Music]

668
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:34,650
so again normally have a lot of

669
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,450
configurations in here there's just a

670
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:38,100
few to do we can't use it for

671
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:42,089
alternative things it's just this

672
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:45,330
operating system and that's it so that

673
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:47,190
is in the security camera all right it

674
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:50,430
does have everything in there

675
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,490
and listen saw a couple of projects that

676
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,759
I

677
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:54,759
[Music]

678
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,999
really recommend getting with the

679
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:22,509
kohanga go cable so you can plug that on

680
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:24,700
the regular if you've got like regular

681
00:53:22,509 --> 00:53:27,430
switch stuff that we get you put in CLE

682
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,720
the GPIO pins some people have done that

683
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,700
too like to be able to turn the

684
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,980
Raspberry Pi off there's unfortunately

685
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,348
by default all the way the operators are

686
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,720
set up there's no way to actually unless

687
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:39,849
you log into it to shut it down so most

688
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:48,038
people are just unplug the power was can

689
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:49,930
forever micro SD card there is the GPIO

690
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,970
pins on there yes people actually have

691
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:54,249
installed our actual own switch and

692
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,439
added a configuration file into the

693
00:53:54,249 --> 00:53:59,759
operating says hey if this switch has

694
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,759
been detected shut down

695
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,650
whatever

696
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,580
[Music]

697
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,580
Lizzy

698
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,790
[Music]

699
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:37,080
you can also set this to login directly

700
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:37,080
without a password or you can set it to

701
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:44,339
so theoretically we should be able to

702
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:54,280
plug this that way in any program part

703
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:57,780
and this is a board as well one of the

704
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,780
other projects that I wanted to

705
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:13,129
[Music]

706
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,269
[Applause]

707
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:27,550
so basically this is the pinky fastest

708
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,970
way this length and the way that we keep

709
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,970
works

710
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,429
[Music]

711
00:55:45,480 --> 00:56:11,380
all right the ink is electronic

712
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,560
technology it's low-power

713
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:16,900
paper like this was used primarily for

714
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,430
readers like the Amazon Kindle so this

715
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:22,120
basically gives you a background on it

716
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:25,690
how it was developed but the whole point

717
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:27,549
is that it is very low-power you would

718
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:31,330
typically have just the black and white

719
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:35,200
like you were like your Kindles

720
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:37,779
however in 2016

721
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:43,169
20:16 incorporation maps advanced color

722
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:46,750
paper which should be delayed until 2019

723
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:50,799
it was supposed to yeah so we have this

724
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:53,500
uh and basically the way that he ink

725
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:55,630
works is applying negative electrical

726
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,430
field causing the white particles to

727
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,109
come to the surface and applying the

728
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,118
positive electrical field that causes

729
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:03,250
the black particles that come to the

730
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,140
surface so by plying different fields of

731
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,990
various types various parts of the

732
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:10,290
screen that evening produces the text

733
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,290
display

734
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:17,910
this little guy here is like 30 bucks

735
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:17,910
maybe 35

736
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,510
so I know that are sold out and Adafruit

737
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:27,759
but I put enough within the slap that

738
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:31,089
you can get it at my room I'm ready for

739
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,940
like 26 bucks now what I did here I

740
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:35,950
might have all get to this this is

741
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,799
nothing that put together like the

742
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:40,480
Raspberry Pi security camp this is

743
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,950
straight off of their website so I

744
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,730
learned under proper the pace of this

745
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:45,410
just because I'm going to show

746
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:48,390
[Music]

747
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:49,950
so that this is just a little copy and

748
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,328
paste of their instructions make that

749
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:54,270
very good instructions here that go

750
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:56,339
through install the software it just

751
00:57:54,270 --> 00:58:02,099
installed a Python library so it's a

752
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:06,930
Python library and I was going to try to

753
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:09,359
explain what my hats is P hat but it's

754
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:12,660
both in help me out here out with the h8

755
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,950
e stands for so basically the PI hat you

756
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,660
will be like almost like a car that

757
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:18,270
would install your computers that you do

758
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,770
other things like people a video card or

759
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:21,750
it's not perfect this is basically think

760
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,790
there at these hats do all kinds of

761
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,800
different things

762
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,110
you put like the they have one for

763
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:31,160
cellular networks they've got some for

764
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:32,900
actual additional displays really I mean

765
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,520
I've actually without using the hands

766
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,860
behind the chief down as itself I've

767
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,410
actually even turned a Raspberry Pi into

768
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:41,360
a radio station so you can put them in

769
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:43,220
for three-mile on their broadcast out

770
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,570
and it'll actually get up to about make

771
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,049
the antenna correctly about two football

772
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,050

01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:09,940
monitor your humidity and their

environment around you the entire

781
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:15,970
library because you all

782
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:15,970
[Music]

783
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:25,270
questions on the back

784
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,890
it is not that kind of the things

785
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:41,449
calendar

786
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,449
[Music]

787
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:51,219
with it and just a small tax react so

788
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:55,809
this way here they make

789
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,570
there I'm gonna cover sit among these

790
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:15,800
No

791
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:18,060
consumption 5 so the power consumption

792
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,070
depends

793
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,480
it's generally speaking pretty low but

794
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,550
you definitely don't want to like be

795
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,020
grabbing your cell phone charger plug it

796
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,520
in there this is what you'll notice is

797
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,410
that when you're powering it up and will

798
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,210
see the little lightning quotes on your

799
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:32,670
screen and that usually means you're

800
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:37,500
underpowered so if you can get the

801
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:39,390
actual Raspberry Pi power it makes a

802
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,630
really great one I think there are two

803
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:45,900
points you have the problem with your

804
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:48,410
phone one okay it's not a solid 2.1 amps

805
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,790
so it's not a good solid by tolerating

806
01:01:48,410 --> 01:02:02,819
either the I won't boot up

807
01:01:50,790 --> 01:02:05,279
or Raspberry Pi doesn't have an actual

808
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,110
hardware clock so when you turn it off

809
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:12,830
and if you don't connect back to a

810
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:17,820
network or NTP or get an NTP

811
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:19,200
Network yeah it's gonna well it's going

812
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,990
to just continue from where I left off

813
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:28,529
so you turned it off for like two hours

814
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:32,600
72 hours all right so on this one that I

815
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:32,600
actually put on a hardware clock

816
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:42,680
Oh Maria so forward since I did a

817
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:47,630
capture that packet for our for our all

818
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:50,060
of our socks and some of other rooms

819
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:54,110
didn't have access to the wire so I can

820
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:56,600
reach for the access $20 connected to so

821
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:59,690
when they love it and plug it back in to

822
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:03,110
another another room I don't have to

823
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:05,360
worry about the cocking wrong and a cron

824
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:07,460
job that actually paid the packets for

825
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:11,500
the duration of the game play it at the

826
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,500
right time instead of two hours today

827
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:25,049
I put this is my

828
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:39,099
Cody complex flex works as well on there

829
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:39,099
yeah I saw a pony with less deflection

830
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:47,440
Cody it's like do you have a Cody server

831
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,880
in your house or actually Cody clinics

832
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,250
that you brought to the internet and

833
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,410
actually streaming videos right on the

834
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:55,480
Internet be careful using Cody because

835
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:57,069
there are a lot of plugins that will get

836
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,560
envy videos that can also get you in

01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:02,240
power strip yeah

858
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,990
they stuck a Raspberry Pi inside of the

859
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,640
UPS so it took like it had several

860
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:09,899
batteries inside you get they took one

861
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,299
of the batteries out for the Raspberry

862
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:14,700
Pi in it and one go to a company like

even gets in there plug into the network

865
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:20,279
now we have a Raspberry Pi computer

866
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:23,630
scanning and sniffing and doing all the

867
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,630
things on that works alright

868
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,750
one of their other popular things you'll

companies are dealing the breath for it

871
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:45,410
by digital signage you can have a set of

872
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:47,240
total execute like almost like a

873
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:49,430
PowerPoint type of presentation or have

874
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,259
a code just to a website or play a video

875
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:55,549
and like from one of my previous

876
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:57,560
companies as a demo on a Raspberry Pi we

877
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:01,550
were actually gifted video Big Buck

878
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:03,920
Bunny you know full 1080p excellent

879
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:05,540
quality video to reuse for demonstration

880
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,930
purposes and it ran just fine on the

881
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,930
raspberry

882
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,970
[Applause]

883
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:18,790
Raspberry Pi is not good I'm not nobody

884
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:20,799
gonna get into I think Nintendo uses red

885
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:22,840
berry pies for our third digital signage

886
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,160
and every once in a while from across

887
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,160

902
01:08:56,929 --> 01:09:07,158

the camera

915
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:13,469
I think Garnica could I borrow the

916
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:16,000
camera look at it it's not on the wires

917
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:18,599

01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:48,380
all right so that may have been the

934
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,500
reason fall on me looks like a separate

935
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,500
power

936
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,330
so they'll have a lender bowl you see in

937
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:57,550
the upper right hand corner that's

938
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,809
occasionally in class showing up that

939
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:05,620
means that means your power supplies

940
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:07,540
under under power oh yeah so let's see

941
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:15,040
we are to the door

942
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:17,850
the senator pi/3 use the u.s. keyboard

943
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,850
sure

944
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:33,699
and I have the wireless adapter here too

945
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:41,330
all right

946
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:46,100
and turning password

947
01:14:52,260 --> 01:15:11,459
nice and secure everyone could see you

948
01:14:55,429 --> 01:15:14,999
NEX next the camera driver we do have to

949
01:15:11,459 --> 01:15:17,219
turn the camera on because it's not

950
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:20,360
online somewhere the first thing you do

951
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:25,559
is turn on the SSH

952
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:28,429
B&C if you want alright now we just have

953
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:28,429
to be boots real quick

954
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:56,980
what the only DS me necessarily

955
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:59,780
it's actually YouTube so they actually

956
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:09,589
listen this setup is the way to

957
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:19,360
dependably reaction Sam has one of those

958
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:19,360
oh yeah all right so we're how do we

959
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:27,980
where you get to the config model is

960
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:28,400
also available on the drop-down menu as

961
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:33,980
well

962
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:37,129
preferences yeah references you can use

963
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:48,190
the GUI script either straight up let's

964
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:48,190
go figuration all right

965
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:55,140
Oh juice you need to conquer that I mean

966
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:58,860
the camel kid wasn't related starting on

967
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:00,810
e 2.1 and again the raspberry like

968
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:03,230
handle kid ones are a solid to my boy

969
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:03,230
over there

970
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:09,700
but that's like pee it's not sustainable

971
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:12,429
think that's about it right there and

972
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:18,940
then charging the phone and wire remote

973
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:22,180
chicken guys every see with a camera in

974
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:24,070
SSI tips you want to enable those

975
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:27,310
they're off by default - this is where

976
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:28,870
you turn those on offer for the this has

977
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:33,490
the hardware clock you have to enable

978
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:41,380
the eye to eye to see or that's a hard

979
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:45,370
work talk marketing that's the first

980
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:47,590
thing they know the power sources then

981
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:49,630
they're gonna scan for the Wi-Fi buy

982
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:52,090

01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:36,330
Oh mr. country I saw just it's a bitch

1006
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:38,009
it turned on the camera and turned on

1007
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:44,969
the camera or waited a second then it

1008
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:47,270
took a shower and this is live on

1009
01:20:44,969 --> 01:20:47,270
YouTube

1010
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:57,680
all right so if we go back to the junior

1011
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,679
directory

1012
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:10,440
yes oh sorry so that's what this is the

1013
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:14,220
instructions for this it's not installed

1014
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:16,139
okay yeah it's it's the instructions in

1015
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:24,120
here all of the motions some stuff is

1016
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:27,060
going to be in here this camera and the

1017
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:30,230
settings in the software okay so we can

1018
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:30,230
see there it's saved there right there

1019
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:43,610
we're talking about identical

1020
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,030
[Music]

1021
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:58,389
let's say what we wanted to do tonight

1022
01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:00,849
you need a battery map and then you need

1023
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:08,350
to sit this evil emotion connection

1024
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:10,210
because I mean if you guys any of you

1025
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:11,890
have come out candles and you know they

1026
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:17,710
get a hundred thousand alerts

1027
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:19,930
whatever so I have the camera set up as

1028
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:21,490
far as if a change detection but like

1029
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:24,250
what you're actually talking about

1030
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:26,650
d-link sells a camper on Amazon for like

1031
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:28,990
20 bucks and it does change detection

1032
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:31,420
low power consumption you can have a set

1033
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:32,980
up so that it's triggered through an

1034
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,920
external power source or an internal

1035
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:37,240
switch of some kind like a motion sensor

1036
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:45,970
and will actually do that it's cameras

1037
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:48,040
like 25 bucks easily quit some place my

1038
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:52,000
spy cam and then I want the detector

1039
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:54,730
camera to see to comparison what we're

1040
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,790
finding it basically the drinkable flash

1041
01:22:54,730 --> 01:23:02,110
camera high that the eye comes back

1042
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:03,460
that's basically when I learned you know

1043
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,630
through that so make sure you sure like

1044
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:07,540
definitely remember the way I have it

1045
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:09,220
set up so I've actually like to pull up

1046
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,250
the picture what the camera sees and

1047
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,840
laid out a huge like massive grid and

1048
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:17,060
you just basically say highlight this

1049
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,700
area here so I'm not like it's not you

1050
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:21,170
my neighbor's tree moves but if a car

1051
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:25,429
moves within to this portion of the

1052
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:31,790
screen that military camera software or

1053
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:37,580
another default 2500 camera did he want

1054
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:39,920
to Lincoln then most of my senses I was

1055
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:42,860
talking about in here these some of the

1056
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:45,080
items that you have is the frame frame

1057
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:47,750
that ring frame rate the Refresh and

1058
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:50,120
then it's also got motion detect some of

1059
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:52,340
the settings for the manual one that I

1060
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:56,690
had earlier some of these settings that

1061
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:59,420
you're going to have here is going to be

1062
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:01,549
for the motion detector and the frame

1063
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:03,620
rate so it'll look at the frames and

1064
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:05,120
whatever changes within that crandall

1065
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:08,090
for changes within the frame and if it

1066
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,010
finds X amount so you said it for how

1067
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:12,320
many pixels are going to be challenging

1068
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:14,180
so when it finds that many pixels change

1069
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,009
but then it will snap the picture so

1070
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:17,920
with the PI 0 and the power consumption

1071
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:22,400
you're going to want to change that

1072
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:25,430
number for the power that you have one

1073
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:30,589
here this is PI will do it smoother than

1074
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:33,380
the by zero bill and there's some

1075
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:35,810
there's also other manufactures that

1076
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:38,600
makes these small boards like a hard

1077
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:41,840
kernel and oat and Odroid they have more

1078
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:44,600
memory they have more peripherals so

1079
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:47,150
this one has an IR as well as a heat

1080
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,840
sink a bigger heat sinks know that this

1081
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:49,839
one has IR

1082
01:24:49,909 --> 01:24:54,768
and actually put a Android image on that

1083
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:56,119
works perfectly for the Google Play

1084
01:24:54,769 --> 01:24:58,249
Store so if there's any particular

1085
01:24:56,119 --> 01:25:05,630
Android apps in wonder for doing stuff

1086
01:24:58,249 --> 01:25:07,969
like that and there's tunnel mountain

1087
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:10,130
options as well so say for instance if

1088
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:13,400
you're running this in the final server

1089
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:16,880
rack and just one particular rack you

1090
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:21,709
can 3d print a bunch of cases this is a

1091
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:25,280
one raspberry pie cake raspberry pie be

1092
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:30,289
case it fits this raspberry pie there's

1093
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:31,999
a 3d printed a PI cluster ring which is

1094
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:34,699
that's why these are on these little

1095
01:25:31,999 --> 01:25:39,199
plastic sheets they actually slide into

1096
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:42,999
a little holder so that holds 14

1097
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:46,249
raspberry PI's in to use so do that for

1098
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:47,780
if you want to help just cluster a bunch

1099
01:25:46,249 --> 01:25:50,840
of raspberry PI's together so they're

1100
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:53,239
not in their individual cases so there's

1101
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,300
a lot of fun things to do with Raspberry

1102
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:55,299
Pi

1103
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,090
google search for raspberry pi Digital

1104
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:19,920
Signage get a ton of companies out there

1105
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:21,750
know that really easy to use I haven't

1106
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:25,950
seen yet I'm sure it wouldn't be hard

1107
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:27,450
implement most everywhere did that scene

1108
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:29,519
with the digital signage they're setting

1109
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:31,019
them up with like restaurants so I can

1110
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,310
even a restaurant they've got the menu

1111
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,620
and of course it does some little

1112
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:37,880
turnaround there video of the burger

1113
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,880
sizzling or something like that

1114
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:48,159
[Applause]

1115
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:58,030
all right our next project is a little

1116
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:58,030
teeny tiny rubber

1117
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,160
okay so basically we want the rubber

1118
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:29,050
ducky there's a hack five is about fifty

1119
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:29,050
bucks and so do keystrokes and

1120
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:40,929
baeksan I did Raspberry Pi 0 do that so

1121
01:27:38,889 --> 01:27:51,880
we need to plug it in computer side of

1122
01:27:40,929 --> 01:27:54,070
the keyboard I do have some textures in

1123
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:56,110
your case they were sold out or you

1124
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:58,210
could not find them somebody had posted

1125
01:27:56,110 --> 01:28:03,160
they aren't attractive reviews yet they

1126
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:06,330
all mushy news but I'm through oral

1127
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,330
[Music]

1128
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:18,489
so these guys

1129
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:18,489
[Music]

1130
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:25,840
[Music]

1131
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,480
all right bad you must mean your rubber

1132
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,530
ducky from hack five that's what it's

1133
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,179
called we're going to use something

1134
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:35,670
called the digi stomp it's a keyboard

1135
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:37,410
device deliver our payload and Windows

1136
01:28:35,670 --> 01:29:01,140
machine so what I'm doing today again is

1137
01:28:37,410 --> 01:29:04,519
just windows a few pins on it when you

1138
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:04,520
initially plug it in I got mine

1139
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:18,310
mine's

1140
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:21,489
grobin

1141
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,489
[Music]

1142
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:49,739
[Applause]

1143
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,420
that's good noise

1144
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:16,989
[Applause]

1145
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:24,960
Karen hemorrhoids which one the jump

1146
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:26,990
done done the down come up and then go

1147
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,990
down

1148
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,060
Oh

1149
01:30:54,900 --> 01:31:06,160
yes it's appreciate outside yeah you can

1150
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:09,880
easily get her there's a lot of scripts

1151
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:12,530
are you could say well disable the

1152
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:15,600
firewall you could set up

1153
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:15,599
[Applause]

1154
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:46,070
comes up you guys back down right so it

1155
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:49,430
doesn't say the reason for that is it's

1156
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:52,340
very teeny-tiny it does not have a lot

1157
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:54,590
of pins on it so basically the pins are

1158
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:57,320
programs you've got to pin said come up

1159
01:31:54,590 --> 01:32:09,860
under your Z and then after a second or

1160
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:16,059
two so what we do to combat that and

1161
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:16,059
plug it we bring up device manager sorry

1162
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:25,280
when you ran a device manager you will

1163
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:30,110
see it come up as a device in here but

1164
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:32,120
then you'll see it disappear the loop us

1165
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:33,860
Peter yeah this I already have the

1166
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,300
drivers installed but it's not going to

1167
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:36,920
be little bit up for you to actually

1168
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,530
install the drivers when you initially

1169
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:42,050
plug it in so what you're going to want

1170
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:44,449
to do go download the drivers that I

1171
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:47,690
have here I have the link I have the did

1172
01:32:44,449 --> 01:32:51,379
you stop zip 64 bit and stolen drivers

1173
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:54,019
once you plug it in you're going to you

1174
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:56,469
and show the hidden devices and you're

1175
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,469
gonna see

1176
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:08,559
so in device manager you're going to

1177
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:09,699
show the hidden devices and when you

1178
01:33:08,559 --> 01:33:11,530
show the hidden devices

1179
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:13,150
it'll be grayed out you'll be able to

1180
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:15,249
right click on it and install the

1181
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:17,079
drivers right so once you right-click

1182
01:33:15,249 --> 01:33:19,059
philosophy what directory do you want to

1183
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:21,459
look in you'll install the drivers for

1184
01:33:19,059 --> 01:33:23,320
there and then when you plug it in it

1185
01:33:21,459 --> 01:33:27,039
already from that recognize it as if the

1186
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:29,409
well IO device at that point there are a

1187
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:31,119
couple of different packages you're

1188
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:33,749
going to want to download the arduino

1189
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:38,348
ide is here that's the main software

1190
01:33:33,749 --> 01:33:40,119
your once we get it installed it's gonna

1191
01:33:38,349 --> 01:33:44,409
take a minute to install it's gonna take

1192
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:46,989
a minute to load the fun part about the

1193
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:48,999
arduino is you get to use the same ide

1194
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:50,289
for different projects you're going to

1195
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:55,289
go in and choose your different board

1196
01:33:50,289 --> 01:33:55,289
preferences so when I'm working with

1197
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:03,639
when I'm working with this board I'm

1198
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:06,610
gonna go in and tell it that I am

1199
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:10,479
working with the digispark board so if I

1200
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:12,549
go to five references when I get into

1201
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:14,920
preferences I'm going to tell it I need

1202
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:17,920
to load some extra libraries here for my

1203
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:20,559
device manager so I put a link in here

1204
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:23,729
for the digi stop digi smart device

1205
01:34:20,559 --> 01:34:27,699
manager you're going to paste this URL

1206
01:34:23,729 --> 01:34:30,639
into here so that when we go into the

1207
01:34:27,699 --> 01:34:31,440
board manager you will be able to find

1208
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,580
the news

1209
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,599
once they let me see if I can make this

1210
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:39,430
bigger it's not going to get any bigger

1211
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,080
so here I have where the board is the

1212
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:43,720
Arduino Nano that's left when I was

1213
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:46,920
playing with on this machine if I come

1214
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,920
down here to

1215
01:34:51,079 --> 01:34:55,730
managed libraries once I get manage

1216
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:58,130
libraries it's going to go out and find

1217
01:34:55,730 --> 01:35:00,759
my digi stuff I can type in did you

1218
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,760
stuff here

1219
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:07,699
done

1220
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:12,710
yeah

1221
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:24,889
I do already have them installed here so

1222
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:35,580
Oh

1223
01:35:40,699 --> 01:35:45,419
anyway one of your options is going to

1224
01:35:42,929 --> 01:35:47,399
be did you stop the AVR board so you are

1225
01:35:45,419 --> 01:35:53,219
going to want to install then you stop

1226
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:56,119
baby our board and it is in here

1227
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:56,119
somewhere I promise

1228
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:04,950
mine is already installed so let's go

1229
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:07,170
ahead and bypass this however we are

1230
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:09,780
going to want to go and choose the

1231
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:13,110
correct board so as you saw I had mine

1232
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:15,599
set to the Arduino Nano so we are going

1233
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:18,150
to go down to which board once we get

1234
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,370
the digi stump AVR installed it's going

1235
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:21,570
to give us extra items at the bottom so

1236
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:23,460
we're going to choose the digi spark

1237
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:26,000
default sixteen point five megahertz

1238
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:29,400
click on that and now we have the proper

1239
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,710
board installed and then under tools and

1240
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:33,450
programmer we are going to choose the

1241
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:37,470
Micra nucleus programmer if it's not

1242
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:41,099
already set up so under tools programmer

1243
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:44,070
this is set for a PR ISP so I'm going to

1244
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:46,890
go down to the micro nucleus now we're

1245
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:48,480
set you have at the beginning like I

1246
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:51,360
said the Arduino is going to give you a

1247
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:55,830
whole bunch of examples so under the

1248
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:58,530
file and examples here we are going to

1249
01:36:55,830 --> 01:37:02,960
have the extra digi spark down here at

1250
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,960
the bottom so that digi spark examples

1251
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,370
and I have digi digi smart Keyboard here

1252
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:15,960
so I want to set this one up as a

1253
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:18,090
keyboard I'm going to tell it to act

1254
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,940
like the keyboard into the USB Drive or

1255
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:22,680
whatever else all right it's gonna bring

1256
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:24,780
her a little guy up here and it's going

1257
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:28,950
to actually start with include did you

1258
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:30,990
keyboard age and it's going to ask you

1259
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:34,410
to put in a couple items here so you can

1260
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:37,230
actually play with this file what I did

1261
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:42,000
was I loaded the pause up here at the

1262
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:44,099
top so I took the pause put it after the

1263
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,650
send keystroke to get it to stop for a

1264
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:49,020
second pause for a second and then you

1265
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:50,969
can have it put in you know type that

1266
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:54,560
what everyone here so I'm just going to

1267
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:54,560
have it type out below let's go slow

1268
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:06,650
great I have screenshots of where

1269
01:38:02,989 --> 01:38:11,599
everything is I move the delay up so it

1270
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:15,139
shows that here we're going to click on

1271
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:18,290
sketch and we are going to upload it do

1272
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:20,239
not plug your device in until you do

1273
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:20,660
your upload because otherwise it won't

1274
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:23,959
work

1275
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:25,670
recognize it only plug it in when it

1276
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:26,960
asks YouTube so in this particular face

1277
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:29,390
like when we're working with the Arduino

1278
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,760
Nano we can keep it plugged in we can

1279
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:33,920
run some code we can compile it upload

1280
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,620
it and see it works we can plugged in

1281
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,630
change our code compile it up on it with

1282
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:42,830
this guy we have to wait for it to tell

1283
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:46,500
us because those two pins that tell us

1284
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:51,670
it's a USB or get out of turn

1285
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:55,239
it tells us everybody okay yeah alright

1286
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:58,590
so what we're going to do here we're

1287
01:38:55,239 --> 01:38:58,589
going to go ahead and verify

1288
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,219
and we have an error already

1289
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:50,510
all right hold on I got let me go grab

1290
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:50,509
something talk about yourself

1291
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,260
so

1292
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:20,830
I expect the Congress that should be

1293
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:20,830
much much

1294
01:41:22,599 --> 01:41:25,599
yeah

1295
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,909
the same each episode

1296
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:01,688
[Music]

1297
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:20,610
by

01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,870
all right put in

[Applause]

1308
01:44:52,499 --> 01:45:00,860
no we're out of work it always there's

1309
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,860
always second second

1310
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:38,089
a university trying to finish

1311
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:50,710
no she was going to show us with them

1312
01:45:47,429 --> 01:45:54,570
alright guys so obviously when you're

1313
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:54,570
doing crap line everything's gonna break

1314
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:14,530
what's gonna happen here is you're going

1315
01:46:10,929 --> 01:46:16,750
to add your example code setup you're

1316
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:19,719
going to run that it's going to ask you

1317
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:21,429
to plug this in when you must love it

1318
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:23,469
you're going to plug it in and it will

1319
01:46:21,429 --> 01:46:25,630
program a little bit yourself or you're

1320
01:46:23,469 --> 01:46:27,250
gonna take that out immediately once

1321
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:30,880
that's done you're going to close this

1322
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:32,350
down open up notepad for our testing

1323
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:38,860
because basically what we've done is

1324
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:41,460
we've asked it to open up notepad to

1325
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:41,460
show that

1326
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:55,820
all right so this you can also drop down

1327
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:57,679
to a shelf you can push something out

1328
01:46:55,820 --> 01:47:00,679
into a payload and write a script it'll

1329
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:05,420
download things and do it for you this

1330
01:47:00,679 --> 01:47:07,969
is this really quick and simple when I

1331
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:11,110
stick this into somebody some Windows

1332
01:47:07,969 --> 01:47:11,110
machine USB

1333
01:47:20,199 --> 01:47:23,619
get it straight

1334
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:55,370
let's say if you're running a train to

1335
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:56,928
run something and then proxy unlike the

1336
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:58,820
UAC a like if you want to run as

1337
01:47:56,929 --> 01:48:05,060
administrator' connection pump it select

1338
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:10,030
yes understanding everything right

1339
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:10,030
what is the interpreters interpreters

1340
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,769
whatever you said it

1341
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:56,540
I believed again the only person who

1342
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:56,540
just plug it into shape

1343
01:49:13,159 --> 01:49:18,210
all right

1344
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:19,619
you want to cook no I say ready I know

1345
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:23,550
the last thing I was going to mention is

1346
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:27,509
what Natalie just said there's half a

1347
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:34,980
program I will also include this as well

1348
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:37,880
but they have a program here that will

1349
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:41,699
convert the rubber ducky scripts into

1350
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:43,440
your this is a script converter so you

1351
01:49:41,699 --> 01:49:45,330
can look at all the rubber ducky scripts

1352
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:49,460
that they have already examples for and

1353
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:49,460
you're going to convert them to this

1354
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:55,740
cool and actually five above this

1355
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:58,500
website that they created for the rubber

1356
01:49:55,740 --> 01:50:00,240
ducky or even actually there's options

1357
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:02,190
already can select what accept we want

1358
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:04,400
to do and I'll create the table for you

1359
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:04,400
