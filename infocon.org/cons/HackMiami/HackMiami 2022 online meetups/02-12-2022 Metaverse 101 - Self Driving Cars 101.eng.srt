and we come closer to the mic we

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
organized record and i said miami uh

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
we've been doing this for now what

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,559
oh my gosh whatever

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
for a long time

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,680
i know

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
eight ten years already yeah over a

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
decade yeah you've been over ten years

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
yeah it's been over ten years uh

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
we did the conference at the

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,039
skin to build

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
which just so you know has been

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,520
i think his order to be demolished which

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,239
is kind of sad

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
we may bring an event this year we don't

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,760
know yet how

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,360
there is a uh

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
a lot of news about

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
the mandates going away and that's

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
awesome because as soon as the mandates

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
are off

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
people start traveling

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
and then maybe we have a chance to do an

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
event we don't know yet

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,439
i don't want to go back to spending

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
hotels where they treat you that is very

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,720
bad i don't want to do that again we're

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
trying to find a venue that's suitable

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
that we can have like

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
the first two three and half minutes

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
which we're the best ones one of them

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
was and rolling stones um

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
but we had to do some research and

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,119
hopefully um the disease the pandemic

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,399
will not pick up

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
and then usually i was actually

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
negotiating with a

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
venue in december and as i was about to

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,079
sign and we got all my

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,040
so

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
i wasted my time right so

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
uh we're going to try to find a suitable

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,799
venue

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
i started making a of a open conference

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,280
like free

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
right but obviously if it's straight

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
it's not going to hit the beach front

62
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
right or something that fancy

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,920
but uh we would do an event this year we

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,239
had to if if the

65
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,000
conditions are there we are going to do

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
an event uh and we will inform you when

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,360
i don't think it will happen

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,959
by may

69
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
it's probably december we're going to

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
really hold off into december we'll

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
probably if we do december we'll

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,760
probably be in the winter hacker fest

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,959
again

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
but we do like a mini cone right or it

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
was a mini con this year was at the

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
renaissance charter school this year

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
in cooper city it was a

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
great event we had 15 people show up

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,440
right

80
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,680
during the plan that during the 10th

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
week so

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
hopefully we'll get about

83
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,840

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
more conversations going closer it was a

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,519
really good small conference that day

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,640
we had locked the footage we had our i

89
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
brought out the 3d printer and gave out

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,959
some commemorative tokens so that you

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
guys could collect them if you weren't

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
if you weren't there you

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
didn't get this year's token so

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,360

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,519

we have an excellent recruiter which is

164
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
right there she's the only recruiter

165
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
he's the only one we don't let anybody

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,319
else we actually don't even let

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
recruiters in the discord because

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
we had had some past bad experiences

172
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
unfortunately but

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
we do certainly

174
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
intend to become the

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,000
the

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
help that you need to connect with other

177
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
professionals we go to conferences we

178
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,319
have teams that compete at defcon

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
example of this is young women right

180
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,639

enough how proud we are and he won black

182
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
patch at death don't capture the package

183
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,120
so this gentleman right here is

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
living

185
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360

186
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
him and

193
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
during hacker summer camp which is

194
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
usually what we all go through that's

195
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,599
thanks uh so i think it's better if i

196
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,800
sit down now

197
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
yeah okay so

198
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
um before i start

199
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
i want to say the following things uh

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
what you're going to see today is a lot

201
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
of my opinion here

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
right

203
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,039
i don't hate

204
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,479
these companies

205
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,759
i had nothing personal against the ceos

206
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
or the individuals that works at these

207
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,039
companies these are my opinions and

208
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
nothing to do with my employer

209
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
um

210
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,800
it is very possible that all of us

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,720
eventually will work for this company

212
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
this is actually happening

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
so um

214
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880

let me oh you have the uh the actual uh

247
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
presentation

248
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
sorry

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
all right there we go

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,760
so again i don't hate this company

251
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
i don't i have nothing personal against

252
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
the people that work at these companies

253
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,000
in fact i know a lot of people that work

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,519
at these companies they're geniuses

255
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
they're great people and they mean well

256
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,279
uh but there are certainly some

257
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
challenges and some things that are

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
already happening in fact before i even

259
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,959
finish

260
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
this presentation some of the things

261
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,279
that i i was already predicted uh

262
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,240
already uh happening um

263
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
the idea of this is to basically further

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
discussion the idea of this is to

265
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
question

266
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
what's going on with these technologies

267
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,360
and then

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
it's an intro to one i don't intend to

269
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
to cover it uh

270
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
in terms of

271
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
the technical uh details of what three

272
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,279
for example we're going to talk about

273
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
what three uh or other technologies uh i

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
did my research through

275
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
uh my best

276
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
uh

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
availability

278
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
and uh access to the technology um and

279
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,760
then obviously because i work in the

280
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,320
security industry and i'm familiar with

281
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,279
the crypto uh industry i'm an advisor

282
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
disclaimer an advisor for a blockchain

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
security company i started some of these

284
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
things i already have seen them

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,279
so

286
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
uh i what you're gonna see today is

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
basically what i put together about it

288
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,320
this is me

289
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
uh what you see there since we were

290
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
talking about the metaverse

291
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
is the google

292
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
these are the google glasses

293
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
and this is uh

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,800
kind of timely because um

295
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
that's the planet linux cafe right

296
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,240
so uh uh those glasses uh where

297
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
i bought all those glasses for one of

298
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
our members

299
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
he's actually part of the ubuntu project

300
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
uh

301
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
he's pretty awesome we

302
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
we don't see him very often but he was

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,079
actually testing them

304
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,519
you know and i have to tell you that i

305
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,640
actually walked outside

306
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
with those glasses

307
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,800
and i was able to grasp a little bit

308
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,079
because it was very

309
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,200
it was very raw and basic uh

310
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
augmented reality right so the glasses i

311
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
can tell you as you can see they're not

312
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,959
really covering

313
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
and you can see it has it has like a

314
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,720
little screen that you can see like if

315
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,040
you sort of looked up

316
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,920
and

317
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
uh it was i was able to walk and

318
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
actually see the information and i

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
thought it was promising unfortunately

320
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,160
for some reason this project folded it

321
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
never became because it's gonna it was

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
gonna be

323
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,399
it would

324
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
be um

325
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,959
uh revolutionary unfortunately this did

326
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,200
not happen better but one of the things

327
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
that you're gonna find out today is that

328
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
what you what is called the so-called

329
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
metabours many of those technologies are

330
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,279
already here many of those things

331
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,800
seen as realms of interaction have

332
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
already been on the internet for some

333
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
time so

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
um i also created uh

335
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
for the um

336
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
the purposes of this presentation my

337
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,680
first nft which is that wrote solos or

338
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
pth and it cost me quite a bit of money

339
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
cost me uh over 200 dollars in gas feeds

340
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,200
and that's actually one of the things

341
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,639
that we're going to talk about what

342
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
things are challenging uh or it can even

343
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,680
become a trend for these technologies

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
that are related to the metabolism

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,880
so that's me right there uh

346
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,399
that was probably what seven eight years

347
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,360
ago

348
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,399
oh yeah

349
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
all of you were there

350
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
yeah this is like very old right

351
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,360
right all right

352
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
so okay so the word metabours comes from

353
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,000
the snow crash noble

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,880
written by neil stephenson who has

355
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
distanced himself from whatever

356
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
um the mark zuckerberg which i think is

357
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
in my opinion is the the leading uh boys

358
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,399
or

359
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
figure that is promoting the metaverse

360
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
right so what you see there is me it's

361
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
my avatar

362
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,399
it's my alter ego in the center line so

363
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,000
what you see in the back is the central

364
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
line so um i'm going to show you some of

365
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
some technologies that are considered as

366
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
being part of the meta control of course

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
in order to understand the matters i

368
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
needed to go into the matter

369
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,720
right so

370
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,959
uh that's me that's as you can see

371
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,079
there's some time i can customize myself

372
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,519
and what you see in the back of it

373
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
believe it or not are events

374
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
in these realms that i'm going to talk

375
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
about a little bit in a minute there is

376
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
all kinds of stuff going on all kinds of

377
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,560
stuff for

378
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,839
concerts um exchange of goods some of

379
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,560
them uh

380
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
talking about in in terms of

381
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,440
cryptocurrency

382
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
and in other

383
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
we even had gartering depending on what

384
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,440
what virtual world you are

385
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,040
um

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
so

387
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
to get back at it right the word was

388
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,320
taken for neil stephenson's no crash

389
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,680
noble

390
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
uh i'm not sorry but this is like

391
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
covering the

392
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
yeah yeah just like i just met him

393
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
exactly

394
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,639
let me minimize this for a second okay

395
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,680
uh

396
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,040
this novel was written in 1992. i

397
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,720
haven't read this novel uh disclaimer

398
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,600
um

399
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,920
and he actually

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,320
he actually tweeted that whatever for

401
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,199
example facebook or now called meta

402
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
is doing has nothing he has nothing to

403
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
do with it right but that's from where

404
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
the word comes from

405
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
um

406
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
a lot of what you would call in the

407
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
meadowverse is uh

408
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
based on pirito rails

409
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
in in their two realms have been around

410
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,680
for some time they are not new

411
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,199
um

412
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,360
metaverse is promised to be the next

413
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
evolution of the internet i'm going to

414
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,240
show you some projections that i took

415
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
from some other reports i'm going to

416
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
give you actually the links that you can

417
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
read them

418
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
uh

419
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,639
facebook who's now meta like i said

420
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
before speed heads the metabolism has

421
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
the ultimate social platform that's how

422
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,560
they call it

423
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,079
and uh it's basically a mix of reality

424
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,760
plus internet

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
plus virtual

426
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,519
augmented reality technology plus

427
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,519
cryptocurrency technology that's that's

428
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,560
somehow i i see this remember i'm not an

429
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,959
expert of this association of the things

430
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
that i research on

431
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,959
uh and a lot of these technologies some

432
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
of them have been there before and some

433
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,480
of them are evolving some of them are

434
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
being created

435
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
but this is a company which i found very

436
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
interesting called missouri which um

437
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
uh has some sort of a manifesto of what

438
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,959
uh web 3 is and they they claim that

439
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,440
web3 is is a promise of decentralization

440
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,199
increased privacy

441
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
new forms of income and new principles

442
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,560
of society

443
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,519
having trouble they're not seeing this

444
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
oh they're not seeing it i don't know

445
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
why

446
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
see if you can

447
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,079
go in applications

448
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,639
oh i know why why because you have to

449
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,759
give his

450
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
permission

451
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,120
uh

452
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,920
so we may have to

453
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
do that

454
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
main screen yeah you want the

455
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
presentation on the discord channel but

456
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,800
not on the uh

457
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,880
all right one second

458
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,160
why don't you just

459
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,759
i can share whatever okay

460
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,240
just take it out of this full screen

461
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
all right sorry guys we're working on

462
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,720
you seeing the presentation

463
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
on discord

464
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,519
no no go to meeting but the problem so

465
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,639
this will go to meetings is that the

466
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
permissions prevent you so sometimes you

467
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
have to get out and come back to them

468
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
there you go all right can can can i get

469
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,359
an affirmative for anybody in there

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
yeah i see it from i see it on mine so

471
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,599
this course should be fine all right

472
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,160
okay so again the etymology of this

473
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
and now

474
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
um

475
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,439
like i said before

476
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,960
there is some

477
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
um

478
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
there's some talk about this and i will

479
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
show you a graph that actually how they

480
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,240
uh predict

481
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,120
uh the the growth of what's going to be

482
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,360
the better person in terms of of i guess

483
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
hosted sites

484
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
uh some of this stuff i truly don't

485
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,960
understand uh how will come to happen

486
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
but i will show you what they're saying

487
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
okay so if we go

488
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,679
well what i call the road to metaverse

489
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,880
it's basically a potential trillion plus

490
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,440
dollar economy right

491
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,320
um

492
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
we're talking about mental reality

493
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
advertising

494
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,799
uh we're talking about having uh globals

495
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
of some sort of a um

496
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,039
device

497
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,640
while you're watching a football

498
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
um

499
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,280
a

500
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
game and you're connected to the

501
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,880
internet you can see the player

502
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,640
displays for example the statistics of

503
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
the player you can zoom in for example

504
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,760
like it was a video game but it's it's a

505
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,520
mix of reality and uh um

506
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,400
you know

507
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
what they call mental reality which is

508
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,919
any components

509
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,080
that you can do thanks to they use

510
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,799
certain devices so we're talking sports

511
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
events imagine the magic for example

512
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,919
having concerts and seeing holograms and

513
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
interacting with people in different

514
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,280
ways there's a lot the potential for

515
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,160
this

516
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,280
and the

517
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,679
the economy that this will bring is is

518
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
definitely there um

519
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,840
we have things such as education

520
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
manufacturing

521
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,039
is already happening the problem is

522
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,039
usually the the augmented reality

523
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
augmented reality technologies is

524
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
incredibly expensive so so there's still

525
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
some there are some there are some uh

526
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,440
issues and challenges

527
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
uh it's an aggressive expansion of the

528
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
tech industry

529
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
for sure we're gonna get we're seeing

530
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
for example what i would say the

531
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
renaissance

532
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
of uh arts right of

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,600
things that now are nfts of designers

534
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,480
being paid hundreds of dollars to create

535
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,760
avatars

536
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,720
right so so certain professions are

537
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
getting to to call it a certain way the

538
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,240
second win

539
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,120
with

540
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,600
the uh the uh

541
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
advance in the road to the metaverse

542
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
because the metaverse as you will see

543
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
uh has a lot of things that have to do

544
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,280
with the senses and how you perceive

545
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
things

546
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
obviously in order for us to have this

547
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,080
sort of

548
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,880
a

549
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
work on realm we we need higher

550
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
connectivity we need higher processing

551
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,679
power and most of all we need to have

552
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,600
that higher processing power at the

553
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,720
level of wearables right i got it my

554
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
my watch

555
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
i have some sort of glasses apple

556
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,919
announced that they're coming with some

557
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,360
glasses yet

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
um

559
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,919
talking about things at home ai at home

560
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,240
a computer stuff like that

561
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
uh gaming technologies are leading the

562
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
adoption in the direction of the

563
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,159
metaverse right now that's mostly people

564
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,400
that are in places that i will show you

565
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
in just a minute

566
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,559
uh are usually the ones who are

567
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,360
first-hand experiencing and in many ways

568
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,559
shaping

569
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
the culture and what's coming next

570
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,360
uh of course with the pandemic the

571
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,720
pandemic accelerated the online presence

572
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
and the is the interesting vr right we

573
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,640
all have there were actually a couple i

574
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,919
think it was a couple right security

575
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,000
conferences they had these avatars that

576
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
they were talking and then you go in the

577
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
rooms and in the rooms there was like a

578
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,440
screen and then there was a presenter

579
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
and then you would talk to somebody else

580
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,600
that did not last too long by the way i

581
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
think there were a couple conferences

582
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
and then that was it nobody pursue it

583
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,120
anymore and that's also another of the

584
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,840
challenges that we will talk about it uh

585
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,399
later on

586
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
i want you to pay attention to the to

587
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
the dollar signs here

588
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,760
right

589
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
i want you to to carefully pay attention

590
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
to the dollar signs here why because

591
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
there is there is there's a narrative

592
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
that this somehow

593
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,720
will be decentralized

594
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,320
will allow income distribution and would

595
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,360
allow us to sort of be more independent

596
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
and sort of balance the power of the

597
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
internet but when you look at these

598
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
numbers

599
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,159
i mean you don't have to be a genius to

600
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,520
figure it out

601
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,559
right

602
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,120
uh we do have uh

603
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,120
an incredible amount of wealth and money

604
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
uh that is already

605
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
put into play in what is called the

606
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
concert of the metaverse things like

607
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,360
fortnite

608
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
roblox

609
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
i would say roblox is one of the

610
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
spearheading places of at least features

611
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,840
for the metaphors and nvidia which is

612
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,159
the cards that we use for cracking

613
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,520
passwords right

614
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,840
that's what we use in bdr4 we're gonna

615
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,400
have to use it for something else uh

616
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
facebook that has oculus horizon

617
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,400
ventures we're talking about almost 871

618
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,799
billion dollars uh facebook is

619
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,559
definitely investing in the metaverse

620
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,440
and they are trying to be developed for

621
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
the metaverse and then of course we have

622
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,039
technologies that are related to virtual

623
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,280
reality augmented reality so then we

624
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,400
have the google has some of it apple is

625
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
getting into it as well and then

626
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,760
microsoft we had things such as uh the

627
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,799
enfts i'm not going to get into the

628
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,240
the the

629
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,000
the full thing about an nfd and now

630
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
fungible talking and its ownerships and

631
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,159
i think we should have an entire thought

632
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
about it if you've read moxie's paper

633
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,960
i think that settles right but but

634
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,240
the bottom line is that they're there

635
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
right

636
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
openc has

637
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,919
13 billion dollars a market worth they

638
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,120
they do an incredible amount of

639
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,799
transactions and i'm going to show you

640
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,159
actually how they sell this in the

641
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,679
metaphors i'm going to show you in a

642
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,559
minute

643
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
uh so they're going to stay there either

644
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,480
you like the nfts or whatever you think

645
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
about them they're going to stay there

646
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,159
one way or the other uh some people say

647
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,159
it's like the ico it's ico but now it's

648
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,760
nfcs but

649
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
we can discuss that and i can print the

650
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,640
 stuff they will not

651
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
we're not gonna be that focused on that

652
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
but there's one thing about the nft so

653
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
you have to pay attention one is the eip

654
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
721 which is the non-physical tokens

655
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,799
which can be incorporated into a smart

656
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,919
contract

657
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,039
that's what eip 71 is the centerium

658
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,760
right the tail is erc20 that's the

659
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,440
standard of ethereum and i don't want to

660
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,600
get too technical but for those of you

661
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
who understand crypto

662
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
if their you blockchains are based in

663
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,880
the standard erc20 eip 721 is where the

664
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
smart contracts where non-forgive tokens

665
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,960
are introduced and then an erp 1155 is

666
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
for multiple ownerships

667
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,720
41 fungible are introduced right

668
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
we can we can do an entire day you're

669
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,679
talking about this we're not going to

670
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,679
get into it but this is something you

671
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,520
should research right

672
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
um

673
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
second life i don't think they get much

674
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
love but they've been there forever

675
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
uh second life it's been there for a

676
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,520
long long time uh just like the sims if

677
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
you ever play the sims in the early

678
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
2000s those are realms those are sort of

679
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,760
available right

680
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,960
um they i try to put an approximate of

681
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
the numbers of people that they have

682
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,720
second life for example they had come

683
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
down a little bit but they have around

684
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
900 000 monthly users the central line

685
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
which is i thought i had a actually a a

686
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,919
very positive experience in the

687
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,200
centerline

688
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,960
uh uh it has around 465 000 users and 50

689
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,320
million in p2p right partner partner

690
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
meaning uh

691
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
entities that are interacting there this

692
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
is your market right for for uh for

693
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,080
alberto world this is remarkable so

694
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
uh that is very positive

695
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
and of course you have fortnite which is

696
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,520
in a

697
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
fight to death with apple we're not

698
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,240
gonna get into that either and then you

699
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,039
have roblox which is in my opinion the

700
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
leading place

701
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,919
and you may not know what roblox is but

702
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,679
if you have kids that are between 12 and

703
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,400
15 you will know what role

704
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
i mean they spend 24 7 in there there's

705
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
everything in roblox and actually i want

706
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,080
to show it to you

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,919
okay so here is something that i took

708
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,440
from goldman sachs

709
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
uh which is you know pretty mainstream

710
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,159
but this is a breakdown of what they

711
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,559
look at at the type of technologies like

712
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,440
it's one of the things that uh

713
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
comes up when you're talking about

714
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
metabolism is what is called the wet

715
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,679
treat what is the web3 so they talk

716
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,440
about things that are

717
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,480
um

718
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
uh

719
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
auburn the reality

720
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
uh the centralized and

721
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,120
when they talk about the center lines

722
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,320
web i think about something like ipfs

723
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,440
or i think

724
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,840
something about like like detours you

725
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
guys don't know what they do is it's a

726
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
blockchain

727
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,679
site like youtube

728
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,559
uh that type of stuff is what i

729
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
uh sort of visualize um but there are

730
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,840
some challenges that we are

731
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,480
going to look at in a minute right

732
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
uh they also claim that there will be

733
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,840
more anonymity uh i can tell you right

734
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
right now that's not gonna happen and

735
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,640
i'm gonna show you why uh but this is

736
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
sort of the breakdown of the

737
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
technologies that they come and to make

738
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,240
it easier and here's the link if you

739
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
want i will share this

740
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,039
so to make it easier let's take a look

741
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,600
at it this is the center one and this is

742
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
me my avatar my avatar is pay attention

743
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,240
to the concept of the avatar because the

744
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,679
avatar is your alter ego right that's

745
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,039
who you are

746
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
in the better verse and at one point i'm

747
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
assuming you will have to authenticate

748
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,520
with your fingerprint or your avatar

749
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
will become you or you will become your

750
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,320
avatar now there are some risks about

751
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,240
that which i will talk about it but

752
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,679
here's how it looks right now this is

753
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,200
sysento which is pretty cool i had a

754
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,559
very positive experience in this side

755
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
uh i was actually looking for trouble to

756
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,240
be honest um this is how it looks like i

757
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,320
walk around trying to to go to events

758
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,679
here's for example an nft like you walk

759
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
and there are galleries and these

760
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,360
galleries actually look pretty nice and

761
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
then in this case as you can see that's

762
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
a that's a

763
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720
a work of art that you can actually

764
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,679
purchase um you can see an open c like

765
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,600
like we talked about openc is the

766
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,399
reference for uh um exchanging uh buying

767
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,320
or selling uh

768
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,760
nfts right so here's an nfd

769
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,200
that is the price right

770
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
so here we go

771
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
we have now h m

772
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,440
in the metaverse

773
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,799
we have dance

774
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
in the metaverse

775
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,440
we had chipotle in the vetivers believe

776
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,399
it or not that is a chipotle store i was

777
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,039
wondering how to order a burrito but

778
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,799
uh that's pretty cool right

779
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,600
right i know it sounds silly right but

780
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
wait wait there is more there is there i

781
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
know this sounds silly and i know it

782
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,640
looks childish because the uh

783
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,320
the interactions of the avatars they

784
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,760
look like

785
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
they don't really look something like

786
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,159
like you would empathize with you know

787
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,640
what i'm saying it doesn't make it like

788
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,720
doesn't give you that sense of this is

789
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,480
really at least it makes you look like

790
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
it's a video game but this is the

791
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,480
beginning of it so you have to look into

792
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,960
the future this is this is the draft

793
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
this is what we're looking at is an mvp

794
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
a minimum viable product

795
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,960
so that's roblox that's me i created

796
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,640
uh roblox was very popular uh during the

797
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,320
pandemic

798
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,679
is a place

799
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,760
that is a company that i certainly look

800
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,159
at uh because they certainly have been

801
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,399
pretty successful at increasing their

802
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,960
usage to the use base and they have

803
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,440
concerts in it do you know that that

804
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,720
they have been

805
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,240
complete edi events in roblox where they

806
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,960
had them do you know that major artists

807
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,159
have human concerts in roblox

808
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,480
they have so there is an economy

809
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,559
and more than that there is an

810
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,480
incredible number of people that joins

811
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,440
this world to see and interact with us

812
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,159
and and also look i put that so you have

813
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,399
a reference you can buy roblox

814
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,600
right

815
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
a lot of these worlds have their own

816
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,279
currencies right what's happening is

817
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,360
that obviously

818
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,000
with cryptocurrency you know um

819
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,640
being like a driver for

820
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,120
for commerce and for for exchanging

821
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,360
goods uh

822
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
many of this either would trade a

823
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,840
bitcoin or or you can even do it uh from

824
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,960
person to person right

825
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,640
so that's problems i wanted to show you

826
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
look there's a concert right there this

827
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,320
is

828
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,240
21 pilots for example it's another

829
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,840
concert right there there's there's all

830
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,240
kinds of stuff going on in there and

831
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
believe it it's 24 7.

832
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,240
you can join um and interact with uh

833
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
this world

834
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
all right so

835
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,799
let me uh

836
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,799
go back

837
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,640
okay so let's talk a little bit about

838
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
the principles of web three right when

839
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,799
we talk about when three they talk about

840
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,399
what's next

841
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,039
um and they say

842
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,000
at least the ones who are professing or

843
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,399
who are trying to present this as the

844
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
next thing that's gonna happen

845
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,120
um it's open because it's built with

846
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
open source software

847
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,559
it's trustless

848
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,600
uh thank you

849
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,559
uh because it allows the network

850
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,760
um

851
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,159
the network itself allows participants

852
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,480
to interact publicly or privately

853
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
without any trust of their body i don't

854
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,399
think this is actually technically

855
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,600
correct but i'm just relaying what what

856
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,000
is being presented to us and permissions

857
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,159
less permission slides is that anyone

858
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,559
both users and suppliers can participate

859
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,559
without authorization from a governing

860
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,760
body that's also not exactly true but

861
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
that is just some of the principles of

862
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,880
it

863
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
here's a great

864
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,840
um

865
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,360
a great graph that i took from coinbase

866
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,840
coinbase of course it's like the federal

867
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,640
reserve a crypto right

868
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,480
i think there are no intervene they

869
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
don't do many things to it but you know

870
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,840
for me coinbase is the reference if you

871
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,720
do crypto coinbase at least in the us

872
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
it's a public company um they have great

873
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
people it works for them they are the

874
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,960
people at the edge at the ahead of uh

875
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,919
trading cryptocurrency so here is a

876
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,159
breakdown of technologies right for

877
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,159
those of you who are looking to invest

878
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,640
research or even get jobs of the

879
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,279
companies that are actually

880
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,320
participating in this number of web 3

881
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,240
technologies so we have things such as

882
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,919
access layers so

883
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,679
so check this out they compare it they

884
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,440
tell you in webtool you have twitter

885
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,320
discord and reddit and web3 you can have

886
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
things like that raider zapper or you

887
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,440
can have things like metamask which is a

888
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,200
actual uh

889
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,840
wallet or you have brave or found so

890
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,640
i suggest you that when i share this you

891
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
take a look at this and you go to the

892
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,880
links because this is something that if

893
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
you are basically technology you're

894
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,640
gonna have to interact with these things

895
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,559
at one point this doesn't mean that

896
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,840
these technologies are going to take

897
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,679
over or these companies are gonna be

898
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,720
successful but this is certainly an

899
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,120
ecosystem of new companies that are

900
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,000
focusing these technologies that are

901
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,240
supposed to define what's coming next

902
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,799
and to make it a little more easy

903
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,039
or easier better better said is

904
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,120
how they compare so they say what one

905
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,080
for example was read only

906
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,559
what do they claim is read

907
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,840
and write

908
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,240
what three they claim is read right and

909
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
o

910
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,240
right and with that they claim that the

911
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,720
the amount of users and the amount of

912
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
generated content

913
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,399
is going to increase right significantly

914
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,559
so this is one of the argument

915
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,399
so what's going to happen

916
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,480
once some of these technologies get

917
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
implemented

918
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,519
um

919
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,159
so let me move on

920
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,440
here's a

921
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,639
something that i took from a company

922
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,320
called missouri which i i think you

923
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,760
should check as well

924
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,239
that compares where to protocols with

925
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,040
wet trees again right it's just not

926
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,079
simply roblox and fortnite guys there is

927
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,918
there's like a lot of stuff happening

928
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,480
behind us and there's a bunch of new

929
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
technologies as you can see here that

930
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,399
may or may not challenge right

931
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,520
i personally have used ens right i use

932
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,599
if you want to create your nft and eth

933
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,839
and get your own domain i use ens

934
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,599
it costs quite a bit of money because of

935
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
the gas fees

936
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,480
but

937
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,359
i read the actual technical spec for ens

938
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,879
and it's something interesting does it

939
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,399
mean does that mean it's going to

940
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,079
replace uh dns or domain name systems

941
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,000
i'm not sure i don't think so to be

942
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,760
honest but

943
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,240
it's there right we don't know if one of

944
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,359
these things

945
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,359
either

946
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,400
block either by opportunity or either by

947
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,079
somebody creates a product based on

948
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,320
these things and stop breaking through

949
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,240
and taking out which is usually what

950
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,800
happens right so you can see

951
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,240
we are talking about

952
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,599
hosting

953
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,200
file hosting

954
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
um streaming

955
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
uh processing

956
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,240
and uh uh infrastructure in a few words

957
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,119
so i suggest you you uh also check these

958
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,920
companies as well

959
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
and with that i'm gonna get with the

960
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,280
technical threats right

961
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
i'm not going to

962
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,200
um

963
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
this is not going to be like uh okay

964
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,160
this is a demo of a

965
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,400
hack i'm going to go over

966
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
some of the technical threats that i

967
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,520
have found

968
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
with

969
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,560
technologies that are related to the

970
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,280
metaverse and web 3.

971
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,160
and

972
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,839
uh then basically down the road maybe we

973
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,440
can break it down like for example it's

974
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,520
my contract because my contracts have

975
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,800
been hacked

976
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,960
quite a bit and if you actually actually

977
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
i was trying you know honestly i was

978
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,640
trying to do a demo or hacking a smart

979
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
contract and when i went to type a cv

980
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,160
there were so many of them that i said

981
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,400
why would i even demo this

982
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
there's there's probably 100 plus to be

983
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,599
honest cves these are cves this is not

984
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,320
you know someone secure crypto oh

985
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,359
nobody knows about this these are public

986
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,960
cves from smart contract derived from

987
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,079
mainly

988
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,480
ethereum launch

989
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,040
which is when you hear a smart contract

990
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,200
you have to remember erc20 that's where

991
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
it comes from

992
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
so

993
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,960
another of the big problem that you have

994
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,160
with these technologies especially with

995
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,599
uh blockchain related is that many of

996
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,200
them use what is called now off chain

997
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,960
stacks in order to make unchained happen

998
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,440
so for example

999
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
because okay bitcoin i think is five

1000
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
transactions per second

1001
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,760
i believe

1002
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,599
um if there you go i think it's four or

1003
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,599
fifteen per second

1004
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,480
um

1005
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,280
this is obviously not scalable

1006
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
um

1007
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
as you add and add and add data to this

1008
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,400
change the transaction fees become more

1009
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
expensive that's why it's happening to

1010
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,359
bitcoin uh sort of happening right now

1011
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,920
with those gas fees the the

1012
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
computing fees are becoming obnoxious uh

1013
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,760
and they're a thread actually to this

1014
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,000
technology in my opinion so what happens

1015
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,640
sometimes it's they sort of use what

1016
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
they call off chain of what is off chain

1017
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
things that are not centralized at the

1018
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,599
blockchain for example so

1019
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,240
uh like ibm says right there i took this

1020
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,960
from ibm it says it's

1021
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,800
not

1022
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,079
non-transactional data that is too large

1023
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,960
to be stored in a project right so you

1024
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,119
have things such as

1025
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,079
mongodb my sequel already so because

1026
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,800
they use that and i'm going to show you

1027
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,119
an example of a recent hack because of

1028
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,400
that

1029
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,480
you can attack off-chain

1030
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,040
to then modify uncheck which is exactly

1031
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
what happened to openc

1032
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,680
so

1033
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,000
that's one example these technologies

1034
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
are vulnerable and can be attacked again

1035
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
to get foothold and on-chain

1036
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,280
technologies

1037
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
also you can have things that affect

1038
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,520
metaverse related technologies what you

1039
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,640
see right there is log4j right this is

1040
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,320
the lock4j on microsoft minecraft right

1041
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,560
minecraft is also par or will be a

1042
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,200
technology that can be considered also a

1043
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,119
metaverse right

1044
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,359
or you can attack

1045
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,200
another uh very common uh attack vector

1046
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,240
is trading platforms so my example that

1047
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,400
is what happened recently with

1048
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,800
i believe since i did this there were a

1049
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
couple more uh training platforms that

1050
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
were affected as well

1051
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
so here's a

1052
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,839
um another example if you go to youtube

1053
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,520
and you type

1054
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,359
technical or hack uh roblox

1055
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,000
then they they show you right

1056
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,720
they

1057
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,599
many of these things just have guise you

1058
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,760
download a gui and say oh i want to be

1059
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,839
immortal oh uh i want to kick this guy

1060
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,960
out and you may say but this kid's play

1061
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
okay skits play but what happens when

1062
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
hacks like this i'd apply to somebody

1063
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,359
that's working in a room

1064
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,760
right what happens when

1065
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,400
they steal your avatar i want you to

1066
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,000
start thinking about it

1067
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,480
what happens when they take your money

1068
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
your currency whatever it is in the

1069
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,040
realm right or they

1070
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,280
distill your identity

1071
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,880
what if you had to

1072
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,839
i don't know think about it what if

1073
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,000
we had something on

1074
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,480
to go to work and they would identify us

1075
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
with our avatars with some of these

1076
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,960
hacks you can literally in some cases

1077
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,560
take stuff from the avatars in some

1078
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,359
cases you may even be able to hack them

1079
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,319
right so although this sounds childish

1080
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:14,960
and

1081
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,040
and and you know it's like gamers oh

1082
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,359
i'll kick you out well that's not that

1083
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,480
funny when you kick a person out of a

1084
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
realm you are affecting the livelihood

1085
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,720
right

1086
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,880
so here's an example of the cbe right so

1087
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,359
i give you the example how it is outside

1088
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,480
and here's the the i mean this is nist

1089
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,359
can get more serious than that

1090
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,520
here's what happened with openc openc

1091
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,720
basically uh used a

1092
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,240
listing

1093
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
process that was based on an off-chain

1094
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
technology

1095
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
apparently the

1096
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,480
attackers were able to get a hold

1097
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,440
of

1098
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,319
the listing remember that many times

1099
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,880
when you went to these places that that

1100
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,760
that work on blockchain you can't delete

1101
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
it

1102
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,240
you understand what i'm saying that let

1103
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
me put this example

1104
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,119
when when i when i post a video on a

1105
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,680
blockchain broadcasting site they will

1106
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,599
not be able to take it off what they can

1107
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,240
do with off-chain technology is to

1108
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
shadow it and when you look for it you

1109
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,960
won't find it or change the link in the

1110
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,680
back end but somewhere that video is

1111
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,119
still there

1112
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,520
and that's usually some of the issues

1113
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
when you're dealing with this type of

1114
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,720
decentralized technology

1115
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,640
and openc actually did something cool

1116
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,240
they went and compensated some of the

1117
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,200
users

1118
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,640
that uh

1119
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,560
were affected by the export right so

1120
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,359
what happened is basically they manage

1121
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,800
by uh by

1122
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,400
apparently attacking one of these

1123
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,079
blockchain technologies which was the

1124
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,400
listing manager and then they found how

1125
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,960
much they were valued use that value

1126
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,680
which was accepted and then uh bought it

1127
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,319
for enough and sold for a lot

1128
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,800
consequently the owners of this art lost

1129
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,480
money but they compensated them

1130
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,640
okay

1131
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,760
here's more threats right

1132
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,079
crime always moves to new rails

1133
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,440
especially if there are more

1134
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,720
opportunities

1135
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,160
so

1136
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,319
second life has been known

1137
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,200
for

1138
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,720
uh um the terrorist activity i believe

1139
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,319
it was i think it was uh there was a

1140
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,359
series

1141
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,680
i don't remember if it was 24 where they

1142
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
were actually talking on the xbox

1143
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,599
um

1144
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,520
here's a woman that claims that she was

1145
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,200
virtually groped

1146
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,720
um

1147
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,079
i don't know just that if you saw the

1148
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,680
news now

1149
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,440
in the metaverse you have to be

1150
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,119
separated four feet so you can't grope

1151
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,880
anybody right and i know these things

1152
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,240
sound crazy right but this is guys this

1153
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,640
is i know we're here and you know i'm

1154
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,720
preaching to the core when you talk to a

1155
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,960
12 14 year old

1156
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,880
and they won't understand these things

1157
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,480
that we are looking at like oh that's

1158
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,560
crazy why would you even think that

1159
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,079
so

1160
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,599
here's another one

1161
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,319
this person claims that she was molested

1162
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,119
in the metaverse right and

1163
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,000
she says that it made it feel real and

1164
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,560
it may actually indeed feel real and i'm

1165
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,440
going to show you why

1166
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,040
in a minute i will go and this is what

1167
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,160
will come next is more my opinion right

1168
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,480
so here's some of the uh

1169
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,119
the more threats that that i you know

1170
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,160
came out of in this research one of this

1171
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,319
money laundering i don't know if you

1172
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,640
have been uh

1173
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
lately watching the crypto world there's

1174
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,880
something new called tornado cash

1175
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,680
uh which is untraceable

1176
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,800
uh and it's apparently technically very

1177
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
very sophisticated and it has a lot of

1178
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,920
uh uh regulators and law enforcement

1179
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,520
pulling the hair because it came they

1180
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,200
can't figure it out

1181
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
uh you can do laundering what i call the

1182
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
centrifuge which is basically you create

1183
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,839
a bs nfd by yourself

1184
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,319
transfer to fiat pump and dom on nfds

1185
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,200
uh

1186
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,720
sometimes there's a little bit of a

1187
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,160
confusion for fugible versus confusible

1188
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,760
which comes from the eip 1155

1189
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,440
uh sometimes you can own one thing but

1190
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,359
sometimes there are certain things that

1191
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,560
um

1192
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,359
can be owned by several people uh that

1193
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,359
for me is not clear yet but maybe i

1194
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,599
can't comprehend it but i i found that

1195
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,680
confusing and of course some of the

1196
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,119
things that i just told you identity

1197
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,440
theft if you steal the avatar you're

1198
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,720
still in the other ego this person okay

1199
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,839
you still proceeds from online activity

1200
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,680
it's like when you cancel an influencer

1201
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,760
right you cancel influences you take

1202
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,079
away the likelihood right what happens

1203
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,440
when you

1204
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,960
become

1205
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,800
this personality in the middle earth and

1206
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,599
somebody takes your roblox for example

1207
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
or take you know sometimes it takes a

1208
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,760
lot of

1209
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,960
experience

1210
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,040
or points in the game to to get certain

1211
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,119
skills and they're taking away so this

1212
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,200
is how i want you to see this not

1213
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
because you want to play a game but

1214
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,839
because this sort of gaming rules may

1215
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,960
become

1216
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,000
sort of an alternate reality that we're

1217
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
gonna have to go through in the better

1218
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,440
verse

1219
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,440
uh we were talking about the et cash

1220
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,319
fees

1221
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,560
if if it is too expensive to create

1222
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,960
anything how would you sell it

1223
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,880
so that's a threat that's definitely a

1224
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,240
threat it cost me a lot of money to

1225
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,839
create that adh right

1226
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
okay so here's some other

1227
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,000
threats

1228
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,760
um that you know i'm now let's look at

1229
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,599
what will happen

1230
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,520
should we continue the path and these

1231
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,359
things um basically develop into

1232
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,920
mainstream technologies we go to work we

1233
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,599
connect we have all these new um devices

1234
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,440
that we have to invent that and what to

1235
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,760
create and we're connected to this whole

1236
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
entity one of the things that's gonna

1237
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,079
happen in my opinion is abuse of cheap

1238
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,240
labor this is a move we call the sleep

1239
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,280
dealer and these guys basically go every

1240
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,560
day with some sort of a um

1241
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,160
a headset and operation robots on the

1242
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,359
other side of the world that we're doing

1243
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,480
hard work

1244
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,720
right

1245
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,680
inequality

1246
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,800
right what we're seeing here is the

1247
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,680
current i took this from a a

1248
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,520
gentleman named

1249
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,480
um

1250
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,200
scott uh

1251
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,640
and what he did here is uh show

1252
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,800
the actually own accounts

1253
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,040
in the nfp market

1254
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,359
own accounts in bitcoin

1255
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,800
uh we

1256
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,960
okay

1257
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,880
so as you can see is that no people

1258
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,040
living here

1259
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,880
i don't know somebody

1260
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,079
eats the mute itself

1261
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,920
okay it did okay

1262
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,599
so here's here's another thread right

1263
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,760
inequality this is happening already

1264
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,760
it's not projection this is right now

1265
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,400
move forward

1266
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,960
mentally illness right

1267
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,200
uh we're already experiencing some of

1268
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,559
this right

1269
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,319
overuse i took this in psychology today

1270
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,400
by the way overuse of digital technology

1271
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,640
is associated with many mental health

1272
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,000
issues

1273
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,839
somatic symptoms

1274
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,800
depression psychoticism paranoid

1275
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,280
ideation and serious material this is

1276
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,480
happening

1277
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,400
right now right this is this we're

1278
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,480
talking about instagram we're talking

1279
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,880
about social media we're not yet in the

1280
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,119
full-blown members right

1281
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,400
and with that

1282
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
i wanted to

1283
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,119
bring up certain things that i believe

1284
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,040
right again this is my opinion i may be

1285
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,319
wrong

1286
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,000
certain things we're gonna have to

1287
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,720
create in order to make this

1288
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,359
feasible and at the end what we want is

1289
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,800
kinesthesia anesthesia is the ability of

1290
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,520
myself or knowing that i'm moving that i

1291
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,480
have limbs and i'm here right in order

1292
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,040
to do that we need three in my opinion

1293
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,760
three elements we need sensory input the

1294
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
sensory input will be some sort of a

1295
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,640
headset

1296
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,160
so sort of a um

1297
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,440
suit

1298
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,079
or uh other sensors will be incorporated

1299
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,280
smell

1300
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,839
um touch taste

1301
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,000
right so this is something that we still

1302
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,359
have to figure out

1303
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,760
we need connectivity we need things that

1304
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,079
we wear and connect to the internet and

1305
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,280
send us feedback cenos kinetic feedback

1306
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,359
so when i touch something

1307
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,599
i touch it and i feel like i'm touching

1308
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,000
it again it's kinesthesia we need

1309
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,440
anesthesia

1310
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,640
in cyber

1311
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,720
and in order to do that

1312
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,200
we need to create new technology

1313
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,160
like for example this

1314
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,000
some of you may have watched it it's

1315
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,480
super funny right and this looks silly

1316
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,720
right but it's an example

1317
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,319
this is an example

1318
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,880
of things we're gonna have to come up in

1319
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,599
order to give you the entire experience

1320
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,599
inside the mirrors right

1321
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,440
i suggest you watch the series it's

1322
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,400
pretty funny uh super funny

1323
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,040
and this is a sex suit right yeah look

1324
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,200
at that that's that's the least succeed

1325
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,920
ever you would see but this is a this

1326
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,200
there is actually a scene with this

1327
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,359
person who goes into a store and they

1328
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,440
show this right but what this is doing

1329
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
is showing it's sending you feedback

1330
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,680
everywhere in your body

1331
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,800
and besides that is connecting you to a

1332
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,079
virtual world where you're going to

1333
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,839
ignite with somebody

1334
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,920
else

1335
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,000
you know what you're going to rent

1336
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,040
oh yeah well they show when they're

1337
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,359
washing them

1338
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,640
yeah nasty okay so here's a uh

1339
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,040
one of the the problems that i see with

1340
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,160
this right

1341
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,280
i this

1342
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,079
when you have anesthesia right it's not

1343
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,160
that you just have anesthesia there's

1344
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,240
also perception right i speak i hear i

1345
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,359
touch something reacts i interact with

1346
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,000
people so there will be cognition there

1347
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,319
will be some cognition process that

1348
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,559
you're gonna have to form inside that

1349
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,680
world

1350
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,800
and so

1351
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
i created this

1352
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,079
um

1353
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,640
graph what i call this is something i

1354
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,280
made up called the ego where the ego for

1355
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,000
me

1356
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,319
is that problem that we're going to have

1357
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,200
where we have a real life me

1358
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,680
and an alter ego on the metaverse right

1359
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,559
and if you read to the right

1360
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,880
i want you to read what this lady says

1361
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,000
she says right in some capacity my

1362
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,520
physiological and psychological response

1363
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,599
was as though it happened in reality and

1364
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,319
we

1365
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,680
we're not having people wearing suits

1366
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,920
yet

1367
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,720
right so this is an issue this is gonna

1368
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,920
happen

1369
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,599
right um

1370
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,640
i i found this afterwards by the way

1371
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,440
i sort of found this afterwards so we do

1372
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,720
you have an issue where you have two

1373
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,680
worlds

1374
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,960
and you have

1375
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,400
your your

1376
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,280
your ego you if you talk in enough

1377
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,240
freudian terms and then you have an e

1378
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,640
another eagle in the middle

1379
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,400
so eventually this will bring some sort

1380
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,640
of an issue

1381
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
here's another example

1382
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,440
we have an esc soy schiso means they're

1383
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,720
torn apart

1384
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,480
reality so for example this is an

1385
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,000
example for example

1386
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,720
you can be weak physically or you can

1387
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,160
have a physical handicap and in the

1388
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,079
metaverse you can fly

1389
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,720
you can have super stamina level or you

1390
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,960
can gain anything by purchasing or or

1391
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,800
gaming experience

1392
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,119
you can have you can live

1393
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,200
in a small home but you can have a

1394
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,760
mansion in the metaverse and it would

1395
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,000
feel like you have it right if we can

1396
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,119
achieve

1397
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,079
the

1398
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,800
kinesthesia and cognition in it you will

1399
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,960
feel like you can walk for squares

1400
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,720
square miles of

1401
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,280
of terrain of land which by

1402
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,599
the way for sale already in the central

1403
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,359
land

1404
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,079
so

1405
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,400
another example you need to drive

1406
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,800
walk take public transportation the

1407
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,599
metaverse you can be literally anywhere

1408
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,760
in reality you're limited by your

1409
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,920
circadian rhythms you have to go to bed

1410
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,599
you have to go to the bathroom you have

1411
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,040
to eat

1412
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,200
in the very verse you'll be your limit

1413
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,559
i'm not sure if you're catching water

1414
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,160
turn your daily

1415
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,040
right

1416
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,160
this this this this interaction this

1417
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,359
immersion in this new world will bring

1418
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,520
this disparities and what i show you

1419
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,079
right here right is a

1420
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,559
example black mirror when this person

1421
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,800
gets mad at these people and she blocks

1422
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,920
them

1423
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,520
see that that's how they look like she's

1424
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,040
lost she said i don't want to talk to

1425
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,839
you

1426
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,160
so i suggest you see why christmas when

1427
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,920
they decide to block everybody so

1428
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,200
imagine down here i don't want to see

1429
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,760
half of you they look like that

1430
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,599
and they bloom they sound like like

1431
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,800
they're trying to talk to you but you

1432
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
can't so this type of things will happen

1433
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,359
at one point so think about this if you

1434
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,119
spend more time in metabolism physical

1435
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,240
world

1436
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,000
you had a better body you can fly you

1437
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,440
have a mansion

1438
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,880
what would you care about your physical

1439
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,839
home

1440
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,240
what would you care where you live

1441
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,839
right

1442
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,920
next ready player one there you go i was

1443
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,200
gonna say that

1444
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,480
exactly

1445
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,960
ready player one you live in a container

1446
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,119
but you you have everything you want in

1447
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,319
that world

1448
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,040
so what happens when people feel

1449
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,920
that i can be better than online instead

1450
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,480
of irl

1451
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,359
in my opinion this is on new

1452
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,920
manipulation basically is the obscuring

1453
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,800
or deeming of awareness or mental

1454
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,079
faculties

1455
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,800
and to to show it to you this is already

1456
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
happening

1457
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,599
we have a major company that has to

1458
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,000
tweet that they can't eat their products

1459
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,040
huh

1460
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,200
this is right there it says it's for

1461
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,920
doing laundry don't eat it right

1462
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,440
we have

1463
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,760
a person that says oh no

1464
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,800
i want to have horse in real life

1465
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,640
i'm going to wear them hey that's fine

1466
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,040
as long as you you know are functional

1467
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,599
and know what your reality ends

1468
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,400
and your gaming styles i'm fine

1469
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,319
or

1470
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,359
of the

1471
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,000
tragedy this person did a

1472
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,079
a challenge of holding their breath and

1473
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,760
die

1474
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,000
or somebody driving from one place to

1475
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,520
the other saying that they're torturing

1476
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,520
children in their arm

1477
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,400
right so we're having already

1478
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,680
we're already having the sort of issues

1479
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,440
with the effects of this technology this

1480
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,079
is this is some of the things that i i

1481
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,799
don't worry because if we're having this

1482
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,720
type of things now imagine when you have

1483
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,400
somebody that says you know what

1484
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,559
i'm just gonna spend my day

1485
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,119
connected

1486
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,839
well

1487
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,000
there you go i'm gonna i mean there's

1488
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,839
more stuff that i can throw in there i

1489
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,040
was gonna put some cute stuff on i said

1490
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,319
that's it now

1491
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,920
all right so with that you know right

1492
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,720
right so this this is not me speculating

1493
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,799
this is already happening right and like

1494
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,480
i said yesterday there is a new they

1495
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,000
were saying that they're gonna force you

1496
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,799
to be four feet away in the metaverse

1497
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,720
the metaverse is virtual yeah

1498
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,480
probably you measure four feet of the

1499
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,559
metaverse right you see now we're going

1500
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,480
back and forth

1501
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,480
and that's what in my opinion there's a

1502
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,920
huge risk

1503
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,880
right

1504
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,359
so here's a i wanted to put this just as

1505
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,880
a reference the russians are looking at

1506
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,599
this as well and they you know they say

1507
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,920
something that in my opinion is true the

1508
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,720
importance of of

1509
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,000
regardless right norms and uh

1510
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,960
when you are with an avatar right

1511
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,559
how are we gonna

1512
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,559
how are we going to uh regulate this

1513
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,200
once there there are many questions that

1514
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,040
are not yet answered

1515
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,520
but if we have people already

1516
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,920
eating detergent

1517
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,160
right

1518
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,640
all right so

1519
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,920
this is another thing we have to

1520
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,280
consider

1521
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,200
what i showed you is a scenario where

1522
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,400
you have to have some sort of a

1523
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,079
functional body

1524
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,480
right so you're gonna

1525
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,720
you have to you have you have to

1526
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,119
willingly put that stuff on connect

1527
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,680
you may not have to at one point i'm not

1528
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,720
saying elon is for this but definitely

1529
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,040
elon is doing things that all you have

1530
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,880
to do is a wi-fi car dude

1531
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,559
actually i just saw an article the other

1532
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,079
day that most of the monkeys said that

1533
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,319
they updated

1534
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,319
i know that's that's terrible by the way

1535
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,200
but if this succeeds right and you add a

1536
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,040
wi-fi card to it

1537
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,119
or whatever protocol is then you're

1538
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,040
connected right

1539
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,880
don't need to buy the

1540
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,160
whatever oculus or whatever right so be

1541
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,319
on the lookout for new deck that may

1542
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,440
allow

1543
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,160
the joining of the so-called metagross

1544
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,118
even more aggressively

1545
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,799
so in closing

1546
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,119
i had to bring this up right

1547
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,119
that is the arcade that

1548
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,559
for those of you who don't know the

1549
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,799
architect is was made in reference to

1550
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,000
pin surf

1551
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,079
the creator of the internet so google

1552
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,880
being surf it looks a lot like the earth

1553
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,400
uh and then the analysts which is the

1554
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,920
last guy

1555
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,319
the reason why i put this is because

1556
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,720
that's how i look in the matrix and what

1557
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,839
is the left is the humans connected

1558
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,000
right and i wanted to close this with

1559
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,160
this reference right

1560
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,079
the adoption will depend on the

1561
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,680
usability and attractiveness

1562
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,839
of this technology for people who join

1563
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,359
or use it

1564
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,359
economic models are still certain we

1565
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,640
don't know if this is going to work or

1566
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,200
not we do know they're going to pour a

1567
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,000
crap-ton of money on this

1568
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,920
none of this seem to be pointing to

1569
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,520
fixing current challenges with social

1570
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,960
media platform

1571
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,640
if anything it will enhance them

1572
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,880
um there is a risk of furthering

1573
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,760
inequality tackle nubulation and

1574
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,799
subjugation of non-tech uninformed class

1575
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,400
i'm sorry i don't want to

1576
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,440
sound snowy but the people that are not

1577
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,839
able to learn and understand technology

1578
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,400
are likely to be exploited that's

1579
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,240
probably what's going to happen

1580
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,040
a lot of this tech will take decades to

1581
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,359
develop and it's still improving

1582
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,040
by no means

1583
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,839
by no means this will enhance privacy

1584
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,079
and it's neither the centralized i don't

1585
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,319
believe it's decentralized a suggestion

1586
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,960
read marxist

1587
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,760
commentary on what three

1588
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,200
when we

1589
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,079
use things such as augmented reality and

1590
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,319
we want for example a certain technology

1591
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,760
to say oh this is my room well

1592
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,319
there will need to be some scanner right

1593
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,799
that gets your room there's cancer

1594
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,960
that sees that you are i don't know

1595
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,480
taking pills

1596
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,720
uh four thumbs and then he presents you

1597
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,520
an advertisement of a psychiatrist you

1598
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,040
understand what i'm saying all this will

1599
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,240
be used

1600
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,040
this will be used to be profitable right

1601
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,400
to make profit

1602
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,920
um

1603
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,760
in my opinion most of this stuff is an

1604
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,480
mvp it's a minimal viable problem there

1605
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,200
is potential in it but it's not there

1606
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,480
uh but ingredients are there and with

1607
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,960
that you know i also i wanted to leave

1608
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,200
you with this um

1609
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,880
my question is do we really need this

1610
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,359
even though most of us i think if this

1611
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,119
happens we'll work on it we'll have to

1612
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,680
break on it we have to

1613
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,680
work secure it

1614
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,400
my question at the end is okay

1615
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,359
this

1616
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,400
i think

1617
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,720
the amount of risks

1618
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,280
that this brings to the users is bigger

1619
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,280
than the benefit so honestly you can

1620
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,960
prove me wrong on that

1621
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,559
uh i still the the word is not yet there

1622
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,200
even though i may end up working you or

1623
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,359
you if we'll make a crap ton of money

1624
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,200
but that doesn't mean

1625
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,079
this thing's gonna do well right

1626
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,599
and like i said before in my

1627
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,400
introduction i had nothing against the

1628
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
people who are behind these things

1629
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,480
uh what i'm worried is that the effects

1630
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,599
and the use

1631
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,440
that this is gonna um

1632
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,400
i guess

1633
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,440
drive

1634
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,319
once

1635
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,680
people are exposed to this 24 7.

1636
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,799
and that's it for me

1637
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,359
any questions if you have any questions

1638
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,480
on

1639
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,920
go to meeting

1640
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,839
if you're on the go to meeting uh go

1641
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,200
ahead and post them on there we'll go

1642
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,799
ahead and review them if you have any

1643
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,960
questions on discord

1644
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,799
i've posted a

1645
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,359
a thread in our events channel for

1646
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,040
questions

1647
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,319
uh

1648
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,240
and then we're gonna take a two

1649
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,440
a

1650
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,200
four minute break

1651
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,319
for

1652
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,240
the setup for the next present

1653
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,319
presentation

1654
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,559
which is

1655
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,119
um uh strong driving cars

1656
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,599
self-driving cars

1657
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,160
an extra slice of pizza if anyone wants

1658
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,240
it

1659
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,240
all right where's the helix

1660
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
i couldn't find the um

1661
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,200
thread inside of the events page but um

1662
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,160
it said i went to the hack miami week

1663
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,079
on uh two weeks ago right which was

1664
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,359
uh the uh event where they sponsored 20

1665
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,079
different like mansions and

1666
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,119
that um developers put them in uh in the

1667
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,880
same house and in five days we had to

1668
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,319
come up with an application most people

1669
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,880
are centralized on web3 and uh

1670
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,520
decentralized applications and

1671
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,280
that's the first time that i was able to

1672
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,079
see what's actually going on right

1673
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,920
in regards to all these brand new

1674
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,720
applications what's what's web 3

1675
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,599
which still hasn't been fully defined it

1676
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,079
looks like the space is pretty much

1677
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,200
broken up into three genres the

1678
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,760
ownership of uh digital assets uh

1679
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,240
decentralized and then um there's

1680
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,599
something that has to do with it

1681
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,520
blockchain technology

1682
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,920
uh with that said i i do believe that

1683
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,880
we are going to end up in the same place

1684
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,920
where

1685
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,760
that this is where the web is going

1686
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,880
towards

1687
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,920
right uh and us in the security sphere

1688
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,960
there's so much potential uh

1689
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,599
specifically from what you just outlined

1690
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,480
uh

1691
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,880
in open season across the site scripting

1692
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,520
um the differences between uh

1693
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,119
that's completely insanely vulnerable

1694
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,160
right now

1695
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,559
um uh another exchange just lost 300

1696
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,760
million

1697
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,160
uh incredible that they had to replace

1698
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,880
so i i think it's really beneficial for

1699
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,280
us in the security space to go to these

1700
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,119
uh types of events and actually speak

1701
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,119
with those uh developers

1702
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,280
that are gonna be building uh these

1703
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,039
brand new applications because

1704
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,319
everybody's

1705
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,480
super hungry looking for talent

1706
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,039
right and all this talent just looks at

1707
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,839
a platform picks uh um

1708
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,400
a language and just believes that the

1709
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,839
language is going to be taking care of

1710
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:08,880
security

1711
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,200
um i've spoken to developer after

1712
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,599
developer after developer

1713
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,000
and uh when you ask them about security

1714
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,760
they're like oh no i don't have to worry

1715
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,920
about security

1716
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,760
so he went to ces

1717
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,119
and he saw

1718
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,520
what's it called um so basically uh

1719
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,039
they're using an ultrasound with

1720
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,839
magically to control

1721
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,640
the i guess there's a preview to the

1722
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,279
archives

1723
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,559
yeah so we're literally i'm feeling the

1724
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,480
controls because there's feeling the

1725
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,880
control yeah

1726
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,000
there you go

1727
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,760
can you show this to the meaning yeah

1728
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,680
they're seeing it right now oh excellent

1729
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,440
you can you're sounding to what i'm

1730
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,880
doing yeah

1731
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,440
music yeah

1732
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,599
uh

1733
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,960
oh you do that's awesome

1734
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,520
oh man

1735

so like using like kind of a

1737
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,520
kind of like a

1738
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,280
mario kart type thing

1739
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,000
you know basically has like their own ai

1740
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,760
on

1741
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,799
autonomous agents um

1742
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,920
that's pretty awesome you think you can

1743
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,079
give us them all down here

1744

uh this will be autonomous vehicles 101

1762
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,359
with my my experience with a selfish

1763
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,920
driving vehicle

1772
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,520
stuff

1773
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,000
uh formerly a a principal software

1774

engineer at a company that won't be

1775
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,960
named

1776
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,839
uh

1777
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:21,040
formerly uh of akamai prolexic and

1778
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,719
or at well i've been around

1779
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,719
techmiami.com

1780
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,080
and uh it can be found at mark

01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,040
daschler.com

1782
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,120
so

1783
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,719
my previous vehicle

1784
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,000
my kind of sort of excuse

1785
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,920
uh a 2014 volkswagen cc

1786
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,800
uh that ended up being a disappointment

1787
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,679
uh it was a great car until it wasn't

1788
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,560
uh average daily fuel cost was about

1789
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,120
five dollars had it for about over six

1790
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,960
years and the last six months of

1791
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,760
ownership oh boy uh almost twenty

1792
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,400
thousand dollars winning went into it

1793
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,640
uh i'm so glad about that extended

1794
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,880
warranty where i had a hundred dollar

1795
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,400
deductible

1796
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,000
uh one of the repair bills was over

1797
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,400
seven grand

1798
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,320
uh then the warranty expired and i got

1799
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,920
hit with the one of the full bills

1800
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,280
thankfully it was only like a 500 thing

1801
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,719
uh traded it at 58

1802
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:34,239
666 miles

1803
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,960
i highlighted the 666 for a reason

1804
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,199
you know when uh you know for the last

1805
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,719
six months of ownership it's in the shop

1806
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,440
for half the time

1807
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,400
um

1808
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,760
i even had a friend of mine an old

1809
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,840
friend of mine from high school i from

1810
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,600
canada uh fed him my then and he uh

1811
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,280
he was able to see everything he told me

1812
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,880
straight up that uh

1813
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,960
my that particular year was a very hit

1814
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,880
and miss mine was clearly miss

1815
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,360
and i already uh

1816
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,360
before i got rid of it i already ordered

1817
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,800
the cyber truck

1818
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,760
um and i was hoping this vehicle uh

1819
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,480
was gonna last till until i got that but

1820
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,159
nope

1821
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,920
so you ordered a cybertron i ordered the

1822
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,719
cyber truck first and then uh too many

1823
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,280
issues and just and i tried to go into

1824
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,120
tesla saying hey what can we do to ride

1825
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,440
into the cyber truck and ultimately

1826
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,400
they're like

1827
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,400
uh elon's uh

1828
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,000
kind of sort of this but nothing

1829
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,880
official nothing concrete so uh we have

1830
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,640
no clue

1831
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,320
and here we are at the beginning of 2022

1832
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,159
when they were supposed to already be

1833
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,480
rolling off the line

1834
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,760
that's the late

1835
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,480
yeah like i'll be i'll be glad to even

1836
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,560
get my email saying hey your cyber

1837
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,239
trucks uh we're ready to do something

1838
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,199

1839
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,960

standard rage plus

1845
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,280
uh it's a wheel rear wheel drive so all

1846
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,719
the single uh motor uh

1847
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,719
vehicles uh from tesla are gonna be

1848
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,560
rear-wheel drive

1849
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,400
uh supposedly has a range of 250 miles

1850
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,719
top speed of 240.

1851
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:25,520
uh

1852
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,960
currently i've put on uh over 27 000

1853
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,080
miles

1854
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,960
uh

1855
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,120
warranty at this time was pretty decent

1856
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,280
four-year bumper-to-bumper

1857
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,360
uh in eight years on the powertrain

1858
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,840
which is the engine and the battery

1859
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,719
so

1860
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:43,920
i don't have any batteries

1861
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,520
i don't have to pay to replace the

1862
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,440
battery at least

1863
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,880
i've heard you pretty much gotta replace

1864
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,800
the car batteries

1865
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,840
um

1866
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,880
it depends on which um

1867
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,640
which chassis they went with with the

1868
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,960
model year i know they're gonna put some

1869
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,840
uh

1870
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,480
batteries built into the frame

1871
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,840
uh which

1872
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,199
is going to be interesting when they

1873
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,080
need to be replaced

1874
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,679
hopefully they've left themselves some

1875
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,280
room

1876
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,480
so i'm going to start off with some

1877
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,159
basics i'm not going to get into like

1878
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,480
every little feature detail but just

1879
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,400
enough to get into into some of the head

1880
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,800
space here so because it all kind of

1881
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,950
builds up

1882
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,199
[Music]

1883
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,880
uh so

1884
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,480
just looking around the car let's talk

1885
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,800
about let's go to the front

1886
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,880
uh keep my emergency stuff in here it's

1887
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,600
not that big and uh you know keeps the

1888
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,760
uh the trunk nice and clean for uh for

1889
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,040
bigger things

1890
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,760
uh there is a little kit that's not

1891
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,960
really in this picture because i just

1892
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,040
pulled this from the web

1893
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,679
uh there is a uh for the tow hook that's

1894
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,480
up up front

1895
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,040
so there's the trunk

1896
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,960
you know nothing all that spectacular

1897
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,480
but

1898
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,239
oh look we got a little secret trunk too

1899
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,040
so no spare tire

1900
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,199
uh

1901
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,960
self-rippings the vehicle has actually

1902
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,040
gotten better with age more functions

1903
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,840
more features better better everything

1904
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,199
um uh

1905
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,600
updates are handed out on a pretty much

1906
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,920
bond of thin basis um

1907
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,880
so

1908
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,120
if really release x is released today

1909
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,960
you can't just grab it like you can like

1910
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,520
with your iphone or android uh

1911
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,040
so it may take two weeks for the push

1912
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,480
notification to be actually sent to your

1913
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,520
vehicle

1914
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,480
um

1915
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,800
when i when i got it i like i had a six

1916
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,719
month old release

1917
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:37,600
uh

1918
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,120
when i first got it and it took about a

1919
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,800
month to start for all the updates to

1920
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,679
start rolling in and to get current and

1921
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,880
uh you know

1922
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,320
whenever i hear that there's an update

1923
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,679
it's usually like

1924
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,679
at least a few days to like a week

1925
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,600
before i see a notice of my vehicle

1926
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,400
uh there is a daily power drop just

1927
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,360
um

1928
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,719
because the car needs to maintain the

1929
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,239
battery temperature you know make sure

1930
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,679
that it's all nice

1931
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,840
uh so

1932
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,280
the internal heating and cooling system

1933
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,880
from the battery can drain the battery

1934
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,480
significantly

1935
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,880
uh it's not like it's gonna drain to

1936
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,600
zero in a day but you will definitely

1937
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,000
see anywhere from five to ten percent

1938
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,360
from sitting

1939
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,679
uh but yeah it's i've experienced like

1940
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:24,480
you know especially in the summer uh

1941
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,000
vehicle parked out at a coffee shop i

1942
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,760
was there for five hours and when i came

1943
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,520
back to my vehicle it was ten percent

1944
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,760
less but that would be if it's like

1945
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,920
fully cool the appreciation would be

1946
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,800
much higher versus if it's lower right

1947
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,400
i haven't really

1948
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,760
gone

1949
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,679
really measured it out but it's uh it's

1950
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,840
just it's kind of like i'm

1951
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,440
kind of sort of blind to it i just i'd

1952
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,120
kind of account for it

1953
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,000
um but yeah like uh

1954
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,960
say

1955
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,719
probably this place i rolled into it

1956
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,159
probably about eighty percent when i

1957
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,199
went back to the car it was at 70.

1958
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,520
and then charging the same rate

1959
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,239
charges slower as you get closer to

1960
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,560
being a hundred percent yes yes because

1961
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,120
the battery gets hot and i better cover

1962
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,400
that in a bit

1963
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,679
um car will turn off features when it uh

1964
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,560
gets gets to 20

1965
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,679
um

1966
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,719
like there is

1967
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,440
a different

1968
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,960
security features very secure features

1969
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,040
that turn that that if anybody walks up

1970
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,440
to your car or record them so like if

1971
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,440
somebody tried to key or doing damage or

1972
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,480
whatever uh you got a record of it

1973
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,120
uh dot the uh that century no central

1974
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,679
tension would turn off and some of the

1975
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,800
management would uh would also turn off

1976
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,320
in order to try to preserve you know

1977
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,840
make sure when you get to the vehicle

1978
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,679
you can actually get in and hopefully

1979
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,800
get somewhere to charge

1980
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,760
if you're gone for any more than a few

1981
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,199
days make sure that the vehicle is

1982
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,320
plugged in

1983
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,560
uh i once took a flight

1984
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,760
park a couple was just a couple days

1985
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,679
uh got to the airport with probably

1986
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,320
roughly 80 percent battery and by the

1987
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,640
time i got back uh a few days later it

1988
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,360
was at 40. so if you leave the vehicle

1989
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,040
for any extended period of time leave it

1990
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,239
plugged in

1991
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,520
um

1992
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,600
able to power all this uh all the cells

1993
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,960
at the same time so it will return

1994
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,040
energy and then just make sure

1995
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,159
everything's nice and healthy

1996
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,640
charging

1997
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,000
there'll be levels

1998
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,840
because i'm sure you've heard lightness

1999
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,199
level one

2000
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,360
um oh yeah

2001
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,719
battery house do not let the vehicle get

2002
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,880
below 20

2003
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,719
charge will charge over 90 percent

2004
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,640
unless uh on a trip

2005
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,159
uh at the end the energy will be used

2006
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,760
immediately

2007
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,840
keeping the battery between 20 and 80

2008
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,080
should make the i've heard that make the

2009
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,440
battery last

2010
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,360
uh 20 years

2011
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,800
um

2012
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,960
okay so take that with a grain of salt

2013
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,120
uh expect a one to two percent drop

2014
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,480
every year

2015
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,239
uh i haven't really noticed anything

2016
01:17:58,239 --> 01:17:59,600
significant

2017
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,480
and i'm almost two years in

2018
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,440
um

2019
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,760
do not always use a supercharge

2020
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,960
um

2021
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,520
when you're on a trip yeah use it

2022
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,920
but if uh if you're at home if you have

2023
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,920
the ability uh

2024
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,679
lower and slower there's healthier

2025
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,080
battery uh supercharging can generate a

2026
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,719
lot of heat thus can kill by baking the

2027
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,000
battery

2028
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,040
um

2029
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,960
oh wait it gets quite hot here i'm glad

2030
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,320
i got that eighth year warranty

2031
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,480
uh so the levels

2032
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,960
uh so i'm sure you guys have heard you

2033
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,880
may have heard about like level one

2034
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,800
level two level three charging

2035
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,520
um level one is essentially just your

2036
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,120
house out

2037
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,400
um

2038
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,199
can charge my car in about two or three

2039
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:50,480
days on him

2040
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,159
uh

2041
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,600
yeah it's not great very slow charge

2042
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,080
uh and not very useful

2043
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,520
um

2044
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,159
uh level two is 208 to uh 240 volts and

2045
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,159
this is all these two are level one on

2046
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:10,000
level two or ac um

2047
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,920
so level two has a little bit of a

2048
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,280
wiggle

2049
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,280
for what the voltages are

2050
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,480
um

2051
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,960
can usually charge the car in about four

2052
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,960
or five hours on empty uh level three

2053
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,440
which would be which operates at 480

2054
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,199
volts at least the superchargers do it's

2055
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:28,480
dc

2056
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,679
um

2057
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:32,080
there's also a couple other

2058
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,760
level threes uh

2059
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,480
chatimo or charge.ju

2060
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,800
and the ccs port

2061
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,679
and you know in 20 to 45 minutes

2062
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,880
the car is charged

2063
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,159
so

2064
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,760
speaking of superchargers how do you

2065
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,880
find them

2066
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,960
well in a tesla

2067
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,159
um you just

2068
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,960
put in uh where you're going and uh

2069
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,120
or just go into the little mode and say

2070
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,560
with all the superchargers and just

2071
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,640
point to one and tell you where to go so

2072
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,679
it's got it all on the uh the in

2073
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:08,480
in dash system essentially

2074
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,520
so

2075
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,199
sometimes it's like a lot of estimating

2076
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,120
and sometimes those estimates are not

2077
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,400
really all that good especially

2078
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,159
uh so supercharging is the fastest and

2079
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,199
most economical paid charging provider

2080
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:26,560
um they do come in different sizes

2081
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,560
uh 150

2082
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,080
200

2083
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,360
so that can

2084
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,000
dictate how fast you actually charge

2085
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,960
um

2086
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,000
teslas are identified when plugged in

2087
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,480
uh requires a ccm file usually done at

2088
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,480
the time of order when you put down the

2089
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,760
deposit

2090
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,120
um

2091
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,800
or you can change it within the other

2092
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,719
website and it'll just automatically

2093
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,040
charge from that from that card

2094
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,360
um

2095
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,360
you most of these place for the tesla's

2096
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,880
you have to back into the charging

2097
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,440
stalls uh there are some stations that

2098
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,880
have uh

2099
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,400
uh

2100
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,719
uh chargers situated for when you need

2101
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,560
to pull in

2102
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,239
um

2103
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:09,679
there are also vehicles that have been

2104
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,760
banned from using the network

2105
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,239
um it will have been repaired and have

2106
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,800
not paid the tesla taxes

2107
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,040
so tesla hadn't looked at it and so

2108
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,880
they'll just grab the id and just say no

2109
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,920
no

2110
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,320
we're not letting you charge

2111
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,120
uh there are idle fees

2112
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,840
um occasionally if i'm like at a wallow

2113
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,440
or whatever or at a station and i'm

2114
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,360
gonna realize i'm gonna take a little

2115
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,920
bit longer so instead of being charged

2116
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,600
an idol fee i just go to the app and

2117
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,679
tell it to charge even higher

2118
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,040
and if i'm traveling going past 90

2119
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,719
it's i'm good to go anyway because i'm

2120
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,440
using the energy immediately

2121
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,600
um

2122
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,360
some locations when you pull in will

2123
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,719
tell you that you're only allowed to

2124
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,480
charge to 80

2125
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,560
yeah screw that you can just still slide

2126
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,679
it over and

2127
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,679
what's the reason for that just time

2128
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,960
high high volume areas

2129
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,080
so so for others other drivers so that

2130
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,600
you're not taking this it's more of a

2131
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
request

2132
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,920
let's face it there's not a supercharger

2133
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,440
around every corner

2134
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,560
you know like

2135
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,880
you know like i can for a regular gas

2136
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,760
vehicle i can just go uh right

2137
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,520
pretty much anywhere right you know

2138
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,920
they've got 100 800 freaking gas

2139
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,199
stations up and down the street right

2140
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,560
here alone

2141
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,520
um

2142
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,199
so it's more of a request

2143
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,280
you pull in it'll warn you it'll set

2144
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,280
your charge limit to 80 but you can just

2145
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,239
go right into the app and override

2146
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,280
um

2147
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,440
tesla is testing non-tesla vehicle

2148
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,600
charging in the eu at those and at

2149
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,199
select locations

2150
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,360
uh saw from the video that requires one

2151
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,679
to download the tesla app register the

2152
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,520
payment and identify the stall that

2153
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,480
you're at

2154
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,520
uh

2155
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,760
this may cause some issues at heavily

2156
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,480
used uh charging stations because

2157
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,080
the charging parts are not always on the

2158
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,000
same side of the vehicle unless the car

2159
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,080
may not need to take up effectively two

2160
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,520
spots in order to uh to do it to a short

2161
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,480
cable

2162
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,320
um because

2163
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,159
the uh the charge ports on the driving

2164
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,800
side driver's side and some vehicles

2165
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,679
have it on the passenger side

2166
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,679
not so big of a deal for say like i

2167
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,280
think it's the leaf that has it like

2168
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,199
right in the front

2169
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,880
but uh

2170
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,880
as especially in the video i saw

2171
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,040
demonstrating the uh the european

2172
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,199
non-tesla charging the guy had his

2173
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:35,839
charge part on the passenger side

2174
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,840
how to identify circuits at a

2175
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,280
supercharger

2176
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,920
this is this is kind of important

2177
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,000
because each each stall will have an

2178
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,320
identified tag at a time at space so you

2179
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,040
can see right there we've got 2b

2180
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,080
and

2181
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,400
like 2a or whatever

2182
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,600
um

2183
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,360
so

2184
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,600
2 is the circuit number

2185
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,719
and

2186
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,199
b is the letter is the port

2187
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,960
um

2188
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,199
so

2189
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,880
there's

2190
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,159
three so

2191
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,760
ultimately

2192
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,600
different so really when you pull in and

2193
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,880
when you're charging and there's a bunch

2194
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,800
of people there

2195
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,760
try to find uh a set uh

2196
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,159
and only take one because it's actually

2197
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,159
kind of hard to draw you should share

2198
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,599
the circuit and you don't charge as fast

2199
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,800
um

2200
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
so while one has a bunch of charging

2201
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,880
stage to superchargers you guys already

2202
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,159
know about them

2203
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,559
um

2204
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,719
spoke to manager a while back uh i was

2205
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,400
getting something inside waiting um

2206
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,320
get the impression they don't get that

2207
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,560
much from uh

2208
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,400
they don't generate much revenue from

2209
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,280
them

2210
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,520
but they should seem to hope that if the

2211
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,480
more people

2212
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,080
they're hanging around for about a half

2213
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,520
hour they're going to come into the

2214
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,480
store and buy something

2215
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,000
um but yeah like i don't have to do

2216
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,560
anything to charge a supercharger aside

2217
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,480
from make sure my credit card has the

2218
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,960
room for the charge that's that's

2219
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,520
because i walk up just plug it in it

2220
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,600
detects the vehicle it talks over the

2221
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,080
network blah blah blah and it knows

2222
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,159
whether the charging station is up or

2223
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,719
down or whatever and just automatically

2224
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,120
so once it realizes fruit for my car and

2225
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,880
goes to my account and sees that my

2226
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,199
payment info and it just starts charging

2227
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,520
did you cover pricing for this yeah

2228
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,159
what's the price of that it varies from

2229
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,639
state to state and i i think i get into

2230
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,199
that a little bit later but um

2231
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,159
to

2232
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,520
start like at some areas it's by time

2233
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,199
other areas it's by uh by kilowatts

2234
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,120
so uh

2235
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,760
paper charge yeah it's like it's i like

2236
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,280
later on in the presentation i do

2237
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,040
mention like

2238
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,560
driving up through

2239
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,199
from florida to georgia to south

2240
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,840
carolina and taking into north carolina

2241
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,239
it was like a night and day difference

2242
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:18,400
i'd be charged say 12 here for a charge

2243
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,199
and then get an equivalent charge

2244
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:26,080
in south carolina and charge six dollars

2245
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,320
so

2246
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,400
it's another nice place kind of wawa

2247
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,440
esque

2248
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,920
open 24 hours decent restrooms that

2249
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,600
that's kind of important

2250
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,800
um

2251
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,000
uh and just like wawa many made to order

2252
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
items so it's

2253
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,520
it's it's

2254
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,159
it's it's another wawa asked like thing

2255
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,080
so not bad

2256
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,440
most superchargers

2257
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,360
they seem to have a waffle house nearby

2258
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,679
like from here all the way through uh

2259
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:04,960
ohio

2260
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,560
um

2261
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,080
yeah like to see a waffle house with

2262
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,440
just look down the road and poop there's

2263
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,600
our waffle house this one was right next

2264
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,159
to uh so i'm standing

2265
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,360
right

2266
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,880
uh the superchargers are right behind me

2267
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,520
in this picture

2268
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,679
uh so like this one

2269
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,480
is hardyville south carolina first one

2270
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,320
in south carolina that i hit

2271
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,560
not all super charging locations are

2272
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,000
people

2273
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,080
some superchargers are literally stuffed

2274
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,360
in there wherever

2275
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,679
somebody's willing to put one uh many

2276
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,239
are in parking lots at malls airports in

2277
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:44,840
the

2278
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,600
hotels um

2279
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,440
a super charging location on the map may

2280
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,120
say it has restaurant restrooms

2281
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,280
restaurants and other amenities

2282
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,920
well the restaurants may not be 24 hours

2283
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,760
and restaurants may be only available

2284
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,080
for customers

2285
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,679
and if it's the restrooms and it's

2286
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,199
something you don't particularly care

2287
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,520
for well

2288
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,440
figure it out um

2289
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,880
some supercharging

2290
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,320
locations actually charge for parking

2291
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,440
uh so

2292
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,920
skip savannah georgia airport if

2293
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,600
possible

2294
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,000
it's only 150 but an annoying one dollar

2295
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,480
extra for parking norm no nearby

2296
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,678
restroom or restaurant

2297
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,480
home charger

2298
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,040
cheapest way

2299
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,920
uh so i got so they sold the uh when i

2300
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,639
went well when i got it they sold the

2301
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,120
tesla home charger for 500

2302
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,639
and i was actually able to get an

2303
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,400
electrician to install it for

2304
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,000
three hundred dollars to make sure they

2305
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,719
do it all right so 800 in total

2306
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,600
uh some of places are charging more than

2307
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,320
a thousand dollars just for the install

2308
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,560
um most days it only cost me about a

2309
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,480
dollar to recharge my vehicle with the

2310
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,400
my current driving habits

2311
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,280
um and yet again it's just best to leave

2312
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,520
the vehicle plugged in at all times so

2313
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,520
that it can cycle the batteries and do

2314
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,400
other fun stuff

2315
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:12,000
on the rece on a recent update like last

2316
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,639
week or two weeks ago tesla actually put

2317
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,840
in uh some uh charge uh charging

2318
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,560
statistics where i was actually able to

2319
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,920
select fpl

2320
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,840
and

2321
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,840
it'll grab the the current price for

2322
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,040
like a kilowatt hour and roughly i'm 40

2323
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,880
bucks a month to

2324
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,639
drive around my vehicle

2325
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,920
how many months per month though

2326
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,800
i had over 27 i've put on over 27 000

2327
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,000
miles

2328
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,360
in a year

2329
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,760
uh since i owned it

2330
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,960
[Music]

2331
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,920
what's your monthly mileage right my

2332
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,800
monthly mileage

2333
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,120
i'm not even sure a thousand is the

2334
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,320
average

2335
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,799
that was great

2336
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,520
i'm well probably a bit below average

2337
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,600
because i'm working from home so how

2338
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,400
long did you get it

2339
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,520
yes

2340
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,040
uh

2341
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,000
uh

2342
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,520
granted i'm wondering where they pull

2343
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,280
the price from but they estimate i would

2344
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,800
have spent 153 dollars

2345
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,639
yeah that's

2346
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,480
that's great

2347
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,920
uh charging at home

2348
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,480
another thing uh which i actually have

2349
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,239
right here

2350
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,920
they used to give this with the vehicle

2351
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,040
uh thankfully i got mine

2352
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,880
so this is

2353
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,679
their

2354
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:19,280
an oh oh

2355
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,639
charger

2356
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:21,840
so

2357
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,880
here we go

2358
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,440
so this can be either level one or level

2359
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,560
two

2360
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,159
so really just changing out

2361
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,520
so

2362
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,679
just 240 charges faster

2363
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,440
uh yeah 240 yeah 240 30 minutes put it

2364
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,440
this way the in the documentary

2365
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,719
in the documentation they say

2366
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,320
um

2367
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,280
three

2368
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,120
for level one you'll regain three miles

2369
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,920
of of charge for the charge

2370
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,880
just by going doubling the voltage

2371
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,800
33 miles per um per hour of charge

2372
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,679
right and then you go to the

2373
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,920
supercharger and you see it stats as

2374
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,719
it's charging and it's saying almost 400

2375
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,840
miles per hour per charging which means

2376
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,920
you know you're struggling

2377
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,360
so so if nikola tesla would have won

2378
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,040
that we would have pl

2379
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,880
uh 480 already

2380
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,159
because it would be actually i don't

2381
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,679
know

2382
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,600
yeah

2383
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,280
yeah so it would be nice to have a 480

2384
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,639
at home and charge two buttons uh

2385
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,639
unfortunately the pigtail can cost

2386
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,320
on the depending on what you pigtails

2387
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,440
you need

2388
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,000
um that one's like a 30 or 40 dollar

2389
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,080
pigtail for the 220 that i had to buy

2390
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,520
extra

2391
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,480
um

2392
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,920
or 240.

2393
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,480
um but there's some especially like

2394
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,040
chattanooga adapters that top like 400

2395
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,800
600

2396
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,040
um

2397
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,080
thankfully i've really only needed to

2398
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,159
use this

2399
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:13,280
uh really once recently it's gonna do

2400
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,440
the 220 or 110

2401
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,280
canada matches the us for the most part

2402
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,679
this one did yeah there's some

2403
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,480
uh i understand that uh canada doesn't

2404
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,600
have the backflow issues that that's

2405
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,199
that are here

2406
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,040
so hence we know we'll talk about

2407
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,199
various solar things but that's

2408
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:32,800
but for the most part

2409
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,400
relatively the same

2410
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,920
also if you're charging if you have

2411
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,120
solar power

2412
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,639
you don't remember

2413
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,000
the mirror

2414
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,920
you don't reverse the meter here come on

2415
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,960
there

2416
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,520
uh well you know you know how like if uh

2417
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,400
for solar here if the power goes out

2418
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,840
uh you're not allowed to use your own

2419
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
solar power yeah because you're back

2420
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,600
feeding into the grid and you can cause

2421
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,639
electrical shock yeah and apparently

2422
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,480
canada changed its code or was doing

2423
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,159
something a little bit different that

2424
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,800
that back fee doesn't happen

2425
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,480
because i was actually talking to a

2426
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,239
relative of mine who's

2427
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,800
going to be becoming an electric

2428
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,040
getting involved in ontario hydro and

2429
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,920
also getting uh first on the american

2430
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,239
electrical grid just in case a natural

2431
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,239
disaster happens and everybody gets

2432
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,879
called down here

2433
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,679
so

2434
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,920
um must have apps

2435
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,480
uh so these are all on

2436
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,199
ios android and they have their own

2437
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,040
function standalone websites

2438
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,960
uh a better rep planner uh allows you to

2439
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,880
plan your route with not just tesla

2440
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,280
superchargers but other third-party

2441
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,040
superchargers how many chargers in

2442
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,639
general and plug share is uh

2443
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,480
it's very useful just but like you open

2444
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,560
it up and you can see like everybody

2445
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,719
that like there's people offering free

2446
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,520
to go into their driveway in charge

2447
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,520
so if i wanted to i could put myself up

2448
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,159
on there and say hey you can become a

2449
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,480
charge at my place for free or something

2450
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,040
state five dollars or whatever

2451
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,119
um

2452
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,360
i usually just look for places that are

2453
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,599
free

2454
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,560
so

2455
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,960
my oh kit my emergency stuff

2456
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,560
uh keep it in my front

2457
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,960
i have a tesla portable charger got 100

2458
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,280
feet of outdoor extension cord

2459
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,320
uh my electric tire pump uh windshield

2460
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,600
washer fluid

2461
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,360
some small screwdrivers and pliers

2462
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,119
note the asterisks

2463
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,679
uh my snow scraper

2464
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,440
uh it's still good i brought it with me

2465
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,520
when i moved from up north and i still

2466
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,480
have it

2467
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,718
in fact

2468
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,320
sorry i can't give a demo how to use

2469
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,440
this noise

2470
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,480
[Music]

2471
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,159
the gauge of the extension cord should

2472
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,320
be covered because if you're

2473
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,760
putting a lot of current through that

2474
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,679
it's going to get really hot right

2475
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:17,280
well

2476
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,679
let's go back over here

2477
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,800
he had a orange an orange one that uh

2478
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,960
well

2479
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,269
[Music]

2480
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,280
but i have it just in case

2481
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,239
and

2482
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,719
you ever tried like going in a hotel

2483
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:44,239
blowing in the room

2484
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,560
and jumping into the car

2485
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,679
i haven't been in a hotel that uh

2486
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,199
where you want to get the windows open

2487
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,480
that much

2488
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,159
well you just have to choose the first

2489
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,480
floor

2490
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,119
you see those american hotels are like

2491
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:02,080
at least in florida

2492
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:11,440
so

2493
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,000
third-party chargers

2494
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,800
so

2495
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,280
pretty much at least in my world popular

2496
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,920
ports for charging so we got our tesla

2497
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,199
one

2498
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:24,320
and then we got this j1772

2499
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,560
those seem to be everywhere

2500
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,360
not so popular are the chatimos the

2501
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,639
nema's uh 1450s

2502
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,080
well you don't really want to do wall

2503
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,800
charging and then there's that css one

2504
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,040
and then there's tesla's old roadster

2505
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,080
one which requires an adapter

2506
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,199
what do you mean you don't want to do

2507
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,440
wall charging well you really want to

2508
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,119
wait uh

2509
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,040
10 hours for him to get that's what it

2510
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:49,920
takes

2511
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,960
yeah

2512
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,199
well there's a hotel a little bit

2513
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:55,360
well it's something you charge for the

2514
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,920
next morning that takes two days two

2515
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,119
days fully charged

2516
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:14,669
[Music]

2517
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,840
oh look i got 10

2518
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,080
yeah not getting home

2519
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,119
uh so

2520
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:28,560
popular

2521
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,000
starting off with the tesla so i've

2522
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,239
already shown you my kit uh locks into

2523
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,719
the place when you plug it in

2524
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,320
um

2525
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,400
it can't easily remove it people have

2526
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,560
supposedly tried kicking it to try to

2527
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,920
dislodge it

2528
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,360
to no avail

2529
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,400
uh

2530
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,159
normally just push the button on top of

2531
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,440
it to uh

2532
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:50,080
to unlock it and if you press it 10

2533
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,920
times you get some pretty colors right

2534
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,080
next uh right next to the charge board

2535
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,360
one of their

2536
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,759
easter eggs

2537
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,280
come on

2538
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,840
so j1772

2539
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,400
level two

2540
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,239
so

2541
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:10,960
it's a circular one

2542
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,679
you know a little adapter i can use to

2543
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:16,000
plug into uh

2544
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,480
into my tesla which i have in my uh you

2545
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,239
have all of them

2546
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,639
i got that and i got the i have you have

2547
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,639
that uh uh

2548
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,040
changer right there and i keep it in my

2549
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,159
components

2550
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:30,159
just so when i roll out you know that

2551
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,440
black mirror

2552
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,320
yeah issue yeah

2553
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,719
uh i also have a karen ring essentially

2554
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:38,239
affectionately called

2555
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:40,560
because uh

2556
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,840
the uh the j17 72s can be easily removed

2557
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,440
while you're charging so if some

2558
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,360
wants to come around and just

2559
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:51,199
jack your charge they can

2560
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,679
so you put this on you slide it in and

2561
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,600
it uh locks up

2562
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,000
that little that little clip so like the

2563
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,880
it's a

2564
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,719
you can see there might be a button-ish

2565
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,520
there but to unlock it so it keeps that

2566
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,800
actually happens

2567
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,360
in the community i've heard like people

2568
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,119
will come that's the entire reason why

2569
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,920
this thing exists

2570
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,480
somebody's got what's it

2571
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,800
and then how do you unplug take it off

2572
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,840
uh

2573
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,239
you tell the car to unlock the uh the

2574
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,800
port just pull it out slide it all off

2575
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,040
oh the car okay yeah but these people

2576
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,800
are just junking it right yeah just

2577
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,239
because it's

2578
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,000
because with this adapter

2579
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,360
there's nothing to really lock it into

2580
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,080
place uh there's like like security so

2581
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,719
you see that little slit right there

2582
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,480
at the at the end there's actually

2583
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,960
something in the tesla chart board that

2584
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,480
puts that bolts into place

2585
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,840
uh free third-party charging as again

2586
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,880
these will help you find them

2587
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,520
i have yet to use paid third party but

2588
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,119
supposedly there's

2589
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,880
uh quite a bit

2590
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,199
so these ones seem to be

2591
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,400
fairly popular

2592
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,320
charge point especially

2593
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,280
go

2594
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,960
i think there's a charge point

2595
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,400
place not too far away from my house

2596
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,159
that i've never actually used

2597
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:13,040
um

2598
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,080
so blink electrify america flow and

2599
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,520
petro canada started uh rolling some out

2600
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,280
although

2601
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,119
that was only useful around the toronto

2602
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:26,000
and ottawa area

2603
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,840
now let's actually get into what stuff

2604
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,920
you guys actually care about

2605
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,880
getting now that we've given you a brief

2606
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,080
uh

2607
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,800
insight into the basics of of operating

2608
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,639
the view

2609
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:40,960
um to activate autopilot while the

2610
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,800
vehicle's in drive press the shifter gun

2611
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,920
twice

2612
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,880
uh four more four times for cowbell

2613
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,480
uh

2614
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,679
uh

2615
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,760
make sure that you see that uh blue

2616
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,159
symbol on your screen on the dash

2617
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,119
uh

2618
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:56,000
because

2619
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,320
if you don't you might be a little upset

2620
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,600
later on

2621
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,159
uh will not activate if you're in the

2622
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,920
middle of an intersection

2623
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,960
uh can't discover the lines on the road

2624
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,679
cameras are blocked or not functioning

2625
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:12,560
and if the sensors are blocked

2626
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,840
or not functioning

2627
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:22,239
so

2628
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:23,520
as you can see right there in the middle

2629
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,800
of the screen even though this layout

2630
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,280
has changed recently a bit so the car is

2631
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,679
in autopilot you see two lines

2632
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,239
they've got those two blue lines that's

2633
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:36,000
means the car is in autopilot

2634
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,520
so

2635
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,560
uh

2636
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,560
lions on the road are important and

2637
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,000
problematic

2638
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,719
uh camera needs to see the lines like

2639
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:48,320
humans do

2640
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,119
not all lines are symmetrical

2641
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,040
not all straight foods are actually

2642
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,840
straight

2643
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:59,040
uh i've had my vehicle try to jump lanes

2644
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,960
uh quite a few times

2645
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,119
uh or i freaked out

2646
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:06,000
and i have to and it warns me that me

2647
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,080
to immediately take over

2648
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,679
uh so like

2649
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:12,080
uh going west on oakland uh on oakland

2650
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,119
park

2651
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:14,800
uh there's a problem just before the

2652
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:19,119
i-95 on-ramp to the southwest uh

2653
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:20,639
because uh

2654
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,400
you're in the lane right

2655
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,839
lines are like this

2656
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,639
and the vehicle's going straight two

2657
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:30,239
years ago yeah i drove there and the

2658
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,000
same thing you excuse me i don't have

2659
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,960
like a person

2660
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,600
yeah so it's a even though a human would

2661
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,920
just hit the lines and not think twice

2662
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,600
about it and just

2663
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,920
um heck even before that the two gas

2664
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,760
stations that are on the corners there

2665
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,159
uh their sign for the prices of their

2666
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:51,520
gas match the freaking uh streetlights

2667
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,480
so

2668
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,800
up until about six eight months ago

2669
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,639
every time i was passing through there

2670
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,080
my car would freak out because it didn't

2671
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,760
know what the hell to do because it was

2672
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,239
picking up the the gas station signs i

2673
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,840
think and going what the hell is

2674
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,080
this um

2675
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,360
let's see also uh on glades i've uh in

2676
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,719
boca just off 95. uh yeah my car always

2677
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:18,719
jumps in lane um in conclusion

2678
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,119
uh all lane markings need to be checked

2679
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,800
corrected and

2680
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,639
possible with the construction required

2681
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,920
actually if anything one crazy thought

2682
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,400
i've had is like why don't we just

2683
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:36,000
put in some uh read-only rfid tags in

2684
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,159
the freaking roads and have the vehicles

2685
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,719
pick that up and that way uh

2686
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,400
and maybe even put some information of

2687
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:47,320
what's actually available in that lane

2688
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,760
uh

2689
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,840
there's different versions of autopilot

2690
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,080
are all versions have that same well

2691
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,560
there's autopilot and auto navigation

2692
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,080
on and on as well as full self drive

2693
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:00,800
so

2694
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,440
i don't have fsd

2695
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,000
i get in the 90s because they tesla's

2696
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,520
doing a little beauty contest to make

2697
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,440
sure you're all safe and whatnot and

2698
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,920
then some crazy runs in front of me

2699
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,760
and i have to hit the brakes hard and my

2700
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,440
my score drops dramatically

2701
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,440
um

2702
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:22,400
playing straddle uh if the lane lane is

2703
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,639
wider than normal the vehicle will

2704
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,400
always want to center itself

2705
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:31,520
so it's like uh you need to gain points

2706
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,159
yeah i have to get up to 100

2707
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:34,330
and

2708
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:35,679
[Music]

2709
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,040
let's see here

2710
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,679
so where am i at today so i go to my

2711
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:42,840
safety score beta

2712
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:47,360
and i'm at 92 today

2713
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,400
really so if i have to turn aggressively

2714
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,560
away i'm not doing anything aggressive

2715
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,600
but it thinks i'm doing something

2716
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,280
aggressive no it's just normal driving

2717
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,719
for this area

2718
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,800
uh heartbreaking you know somebody gets

2719
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,119
in front of me i get stopped but you

2720
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:02,800
know my collision warnings on safe

2721
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,080
following and all you know all that

2722
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,719
other stuff i'm all good but so if you

2723
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,280
get to a hundred percent you could do i

2724
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,040
may get full full stop

2725
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:18,320
oh wow

2726
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,920
um

2727
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,480
so okay wait um

2728
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,840
lane is wider than normal vehicle will

2729
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,440
always want to center so so like when

2730
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,920
you if you're having to be in any lane

2731
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,159
that's part of the merge lane sequence

2732
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:33,840
or merging onto a highway it

2733
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,480
it will try and just center itself

2734
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,199
and you know look really weird weird um

2735
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:42,000
uh

2736
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,480
the visualization the visualization on

2737
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,239
screen flicker when it's trying to

2738
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:48,400
figure out where the links actually are

2739
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,560
if things are iffy

2740
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,800
uh mislabeled or dirty markers that

2741
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,480
haven't been fully removed can cause

2742
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,880
issues because the cameras will pick it

2743
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,719
up and it thinks it's something

2744
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,239
authoritative

2745
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:02,239
uh so like if you're in the leftmost

2746
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,400
lane where there can be a left turn and

2747
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,040
there's a bunch of lines to uh to guide

2748
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,440
um even though you want to go straight

2749
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,920
uh that all those that can make the

2750
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,320
vehicle veer off to the left as a

2751
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,159
thinking that's gonna want to make that

2752
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:18,639
that lane change or to make that turn

2753
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:19,840
um

2754
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,679
and that can be problematic especially

2755
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,520
if you leave it on

2756
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,840
traffic

2757
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,719
train tracks

2758
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:32,800
um just drive over them manually

2759
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,920
just drive over them

2760
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,159
even when approaching them just go

2761
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:39,119
manual

2762
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:43,119
um the vehicle doesn't slow down at all

2763
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:46,320
quite a bit discomfort

2764
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,679
uh

2765
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,880
not all train tracks are an issue but uh

2766
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,880
most seem to be because i came across a

2767
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,280
couple sets that uh i could have i can

2768
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,880
leave my uh

2769
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,199
uh my autopilot on

2770
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,360
uh just cause i was in a different area

2771
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,159
and

2772
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,600
binding stuff for the road were a little

2773
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,960
bit different

2774
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,840
um

2775
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,080
but that's one spot far away

2776
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,239
not around here

2777
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:13,440
um

2778
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,280
yes and all those lines so we got the

2779
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,440
three box lines going coming up to the

2780
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,920
railroad tracks you know and it's kind

2781
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,080
of again but which one will stop that

2782
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,119
yeah so it's like does it stop at the

2783
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,280
first one does it stop at the sun in the

2784
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,920
middle or does it stop at the end and

2785
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,920
i've had the vehicle just slam the

2786
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,000
brakes for the first one

2787
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,360
unless there's a vehicle in front of it

2788
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,600
and kind of just you know plays follow

2789
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,520
the leader also

2790
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,199
some train tracks

2791
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,199
and country roads don't have the

2792
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:49,040
barricade or yep no and that's actually

2793
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,800
the ones that were okay

2794
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,480
were that um but yeah there's

2795
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,560
stuff it's like an oncoming train

2796
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,840
it's not gonna see

2797
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,119
yeah

2798
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,679
um getting through intersections that's

2799
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:03,600
why you need to play ludacris

2800
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,600
[Laughter]

2801
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,000
ready to get the senate train

2802
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,440
uh getting through intersections while

2803
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,119
on autopilot the vehicle will detect

2804
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:15,520
stop signs red lights blinking lights

2805
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,040
and will stop

2806
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,000
uh

2807
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,360
and it can be annoying because the

2808
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,679
blinking yellow doesn't mean stop you

2809
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:23,520
have to hit the accelerator power

2810
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,800
through or turn it off the autopilot and

2811
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,320
otherwise the vehicle will complain and

2812
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,400
for those that may not be aware blinking

2813
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,159
yellow doesn't mean stop it just means

2814
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:36,560
caution

2815
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,360
the the the earth goes faster

2816
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,719
this area

2817
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,639
um if you get to an intersection and

2818
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:44,239
there's a vehicle in front of front of

2819
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:47,040
you moving through uh moved and moving

2820
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,679
uh as i said a little while ago it will

2821
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,119
play follow the leader and continue to

2822
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:52,239
go through

2823
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,599
uh if you get to an intersection and

2824
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:55,119
there's not a vehicle in front of you

2825
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:57,040
even though if it's green you will have

2826
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,480
to hit the shifter or press on the

2827
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,199
accelerator uh to moment momentarily to

2828
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:05,280
continue so i'd like to be green

2829
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,920
green for quite a while um

2830
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,000
but you still have to potentially tell

2831
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,599
if the vehicle still continues through

2832
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,119
otherwise it starts slowing down it

2833
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:17,280
wants to stop out of green light

2834
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,080
speeding with autopilot

2835
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,080
so i was just testing it out with um

2836
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,800
uh nobody was around late at night

2837
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,840
uh

2838
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:30,639
so

2839
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,880
light was turning red the vehicle may

2840
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,639
not stop in time and it will

2841
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,960
automatically hit the brakes hard

2842
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,159
and go past the line

2843
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,880
um so i was doing like 20 over

2844
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,679
and well i haven't done that again

2845
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,480
because i got a little wiser

2846
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:52,480
uh so parking could be a lot better

2847
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,800
uh vehicles can sometimes have issues

2848
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,199
detecting parking spots so

2849
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:58,960
unless those lines are very

2850
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,560
clear

2851
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,719
uh it's not going to pick it up uh you

2852
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,320
can parallel park i've done that they

2853
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,679
can back in i can regularly do that one

2854
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,760
may pick it up better

2855
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,320
uh no it doesn't pull in

2856
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,440
um

2857
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,639
when activated it seems a bit drunk

2858
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:18,840
i can do it much quicker with my backup

2859
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:22,159
camera uh now i have a camera for the

2860
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:24,400
first time i barely ever backed in

2861
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:27,840
uh now it's ascension just

2862
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,520
don't even look back have you used the

2863
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,560
one that

2864
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,719
you come out from somewhere and call it

2865
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,440
and it comes oh for crying out loud no

2866
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,759
hold on

2867
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,840
apparently

2868
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,560
oh you have to give him yeah

2869
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,159
just check your phone and give give you

2870
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:48,920
access that's what i'm doing right now

2871
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,239
you have to go back down

2872
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:16,560
probably

2873
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,639
just refresh

2874
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:23,280
that's like no no no okay one slide

2875
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,520
whatever

2876
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,119
all right hold on

2877
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:38,320
let's uh let's go back to this right

2878
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,280
here let's take care of that

2879
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:59,080
lesson

2880
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,280
blessed

2881
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,840
do you get access

2882
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,280
are you good

2883
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,400
yeah

2884
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,440
sure move forward

2885
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:33,119
you go on your discord on your phone

2886
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:36,559
check to make sure that it's up

2887
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:42,638
there we go all right

2888
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,440
so here we are starting

2889
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,880
we want to make sure that they're

2890
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,880
watching it

2891
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,639
pretty sure that's only one person so as

2892
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:52,719
you might be able to see it's

2893
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:56,159
falling into the freaking line

2894
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,679
now it's going to go back and forth back

2895
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:01,760
and forth back and forth see the car is

2896
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,599
folded this is the car on its own this

2897
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:05,520
is my car

2898
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,440
so and it's you know kind of far off

2899
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,599
did it actually pick that lane now

2900
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,840
because it looks like this is happening

2901
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:17,280
oh there it is yeah double one

2902
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
yes three cameras

2903
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,920
oh at least there's a like seven or

2904
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,719
eight

2905
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:25,119
it's just it's just showing the uh the

2906
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,280
rear view and the two sides

2907
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,520
uh there's also an assembly out front uh

2908
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,880
right behind the uh the rear view mirror

2909
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,639
and while there's another one on there

2910
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:37,840
so there's multiple in the room

2911
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,280
so

2912
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,119
as you can see it's going back out and

2913
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:44,320
out turning all over the place

2914
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:47,520
and then finally

2915
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,719
done

2916
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,560
ready and then puts it into uh so

2917
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,239
i do a lot more gracefully but

2918
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,719
not bad though no no it's not bad not

2919
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,480
bad

2920
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,800
but you know it definitely looks like uh

2921
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,639
it's drunk or it's just

2922
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,639
learning to drive

2923
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,320
all right so now auto navigation

2924
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,840
uh we to activate auto navigation um

2925
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,159
well first off you have to already have

2926
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,280
something set in the gps uh put your

2927
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:22,800
plan in there you have to have uh

2928
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,560
auto actually

2929
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,280
start off i have activating autopilot

2930
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:32,400
uh really only works on highways and

2931
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,280
uh

2932
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:37,119
won't work on city streets um

2933
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:39,920
this better yet again this does not have

2934
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,599
the full self drive

2935
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,960
uh the lane changing can get annoying

2936
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,800
so it's always trying to optimize as

2937
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,080
opposed to

2938
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,440
you know just saying hey actually you

2939
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,440
know what i'm okay for the moment so

2940
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,560
it's always trying to get up to speed

2941
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,239
and live up to that speed

2942
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:55,119
and

2943
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,960
it makes some interesting choices

2944
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,960
especially when you're 0.2 miles away

2945
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,719
from the exit you're both supposed to be

2946
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:02,400
getting off of

2947
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,560
and you just have to tell it to ignore

2948
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,400
now ignore until you just get fed up and

2949
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,560
turn it off

2950
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,280
and i can like i've used it

2951
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,239
uh

2952
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:14,950
i'm going north and it's just like

2953
01:56:14,950 --> 01:56:17,520
[Music]

2954
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,199
i'm just like no screw we'll just stay

2955
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,599
with this crowd be happy with this crowd

2956
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:24,000
um

2957
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,239
and it doesn't really like i

2958
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:29,040
tried using it going down to miami once

2959
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,239
and

2960
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,639
coming off the turnpike and with

2961
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,199
everybody cramming into the exit

2962
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:36,719
uh it

2963
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:40,080
it wasn't working out too well

2964
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,679
so here's a screenshot

2965
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:45,360
of uh

2966
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:48,239
of autopilot activated so now instead of

2967
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:51,280
having the two lines on the side it's

2968
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:54,159
went to one cent uh single line in front

2969
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:56,719
so to know to note that the autopilot is

2970
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:59,119
active

2971
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,920
so they changed their interface a bit so

2972
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:02,960
this is

2973
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,119
actually from my vehicle

2974
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:09,440
uh so now that big blurry icon is now

2975
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,920
but it's used to activate it uh yet

2976
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,440
again the single line

2977
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,000
and there's a wing change that it's

2978
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,280
trying to do

2979
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:20,159
with uh now with the added uh

2980
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:23,799
blind spot camera

2981
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,760
a physical hack that pretty much in the

2982
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,080
community know everybody knows

2983
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:36,239
but don't do it just don't

2984
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,440
so

2985
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,599
vehicle does check to make sure you're

2986
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,119
trying to pay attention

2987
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:44,639
so here

2988
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:47,840
a quick little video of

2989
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:50,800
of just the alert it can show you

2990
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,800
like it blows blue

2991
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,400
it's got that little text box at the

2992
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,360
bottom

2993
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,400
and

2994
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,199
it's just what it needs to be done

2995
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:01,040
for this you have to give the wheel a

2996
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,400
little tug

2997
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,480
so that it knows that you're you're

2998
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,760
paying attention

2999
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,360
even though you probably aren't anything

3000
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,520
it's like a seat belt

3001
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:11,440
oh really yeah right you just you don't

3002
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,800
have it on it

3003
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,320
it wants to it wants to feel some

3004
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,480
feedback on the steering oh

3005
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:17,199
yeah

3006
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:19,599
so you just put it down yeah so some

3007
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:21,440
people have made weights

3008
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,800
uh freaking

3009
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,239
water bottles uh anything that won't

3010
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:28,239
let them just enough pressure not to

3011
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:31,520
disengage the the autopilot

3012
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,880
uh

3013
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,119
so yeah then you just get these from

3014
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:37,040
these are all bad ideas

3015
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:37,760
uh

3016
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,520
so that that one's like looks like a

3017
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,840
freaking clay pliable weight and just

3018
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:44,000
tucked it aside so it gives a little

3019
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,639
little bit and that's that one as well

3020
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:49,840
now there's another one that i've seen

3021
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,880
uh

3022
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,679
but

3023
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:53,679
the trip bringing it all together from

3024
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:56,080
fort lauderdale rally windsor and

3025
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:57,840
toronto on back

3026
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,440
approximately 3 400 miles or 5

3027
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,719
hundred kilometers round trip

3028
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:05,840
so

3029
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,920
fort lauderdale rally

3030
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,760
windsor toronto

3031
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,040
although uh

3032
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,119
want to try crossing windsor's bridge

3033
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:14,639
today

3034
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:17,119
um yes all our community improv codes

3035
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:19,759
start with the y

3036
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,159
purpose of the trip well go but happened

3037
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:24,480
most of you probably fairly well

3038
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,599
oh

3039
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:27,760
uh but almost was almost two years since

3040
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,440
i visited seen any of my family that are

3041
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,960
all up in canada

3042
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,080
um

3043
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,280
and i needed to get the hell out of the

3044
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,800
area for a bit because you know

3045
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,840
just going stir crates

3046
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:39,760
why don't you chose to drive at that

3047
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:42,239
time well pcr issues

3048
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,480
in order to enter canada in november and

3049
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,239
to pretty much present day one must have

3050
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:48,719
a pcr test that is negative that is no

3051
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:50,800
less than three days old

3052
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,360
uh and with any pcr test you're not

3053
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:56,840
guaranteed delivery they say two days

3054
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:00,400
but i got one in four

3055
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,400
and i was glad that i decided to do two

3056
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,920
pcr tests

3057
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,840
because the uh the one that i expected

3058
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,679
to get in about a day

3059
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:09,040
um

3060
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:13,280
like what one like the one time uh

3061
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:16,000
it looked actually back in two days

3062
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,119
um

3063
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:18,239
kind of ruined my trip because i was

3064
02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:19,760
expecting another day but i got a day

3065
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,760
early and then the same exact same place

3066
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,520
was two days late

3067
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,080
yesterday nailed jello to the yes let's

3068
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,599
say yeah

3069
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,840
yeah nailing jello to a tree

3070
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,760
like

3071
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,520
um

3072
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,920
uh with booking a flight i lose risking

3073
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,679
my money or paying for extra insurance

3074
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:40,159
you know if i test a positive and that's

3075
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:42,320
really to get kind of as as i said

3076
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,000
earlier to get into canada how can you

3077
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,719
even board a flight or a train in canada

3078
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:49,040
i have to have a clean

3079
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,880
pcr test i have to have a negative piece

3080
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,159
of your test

3081
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:55,280
and not if you're a citizen

3082
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:18,800
they wouldn't open up the freaking

3083
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,960
window until i put my mask on and then i

3084
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,880
get it across when i crossed into

3085
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,800
detroit the guy at customs on the

3086
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,199
detroit side didn't give a he was

3087
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:30,400
already like give me your papers

3088
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,199
uh

3089
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:36,000
so and if i fly into toronto i still

3090
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,639
need to get a train ticket and

3091
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:40,239
and to even return on a train i have to

3092
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:42,639
get a another pcr test and

3093
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:43,920
effectively with my insurance and

3094
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,760
everything that's going on here the pcr

3095
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,000
tests are free but in canada there's a

3096
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,119
couple hundred bucks a pop

3097
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:52,480
um

3098
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:53,520
so

3099
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,639
uh

3100
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:56,639
yeah and with the pcr test you're not

3101
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,800
necessarily guaranteed to do it like i

3102
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,920
think it was

3103
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,280
about less than a month ago i was

3104
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,040
hearing about yeah i did a

3105
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,040
past two two weeks ago and i still have

3106
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:08,239
yet to receive my results

3107
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,080
um

3108
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,239
i could fly to detroit

3109
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:14,159
that used to be simple

3110
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,000
it's technically romulus

3111
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,520
um homeless michigan uh it's cheap it

3112
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,679
would cost me 80 bucks not even most of

3113
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:22,639
the time

3114
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:23,840
um

3115
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,760
windsor has a

3116
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,199
tunnel bus

3117
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:28,880
uh but it's

3118
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,880
running it's two years you know cost

3119
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,119
five bucks so i just take an uber or

3120
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:35,360
whatever to one of their stops and boom

3121
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:36,159
done

3122
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:37,679
but you know what i

3123
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:39,760
have it uh metro cab used to drive

3124
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,440
across

3125
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:44,239
there no drivers available veterans cab

3126
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:46,400
from windsor well they didn't drop me

3127
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,760
off at the airport but they absolutely

3128
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,800
refused to pick me up

3129
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:53,280
um rubber queue which was a little

3130
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,040
shuttle bus that runs from detroit to

3131
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:57,280
toronto through uh windsor and london

3132
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,639
ontario

3133
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:00,880
uh they weren't running and a rental car

3134
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:03,679
was a thousand dollars plus a week

3135
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:05,360
that

3136
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,440
uh and when i landed in detroit i may

3137
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,599
not even have my pcr test

3138
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:11,679
so screw that so i drove

3139
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:14,320
i took my pcr and later that evening i

3140
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,360
left worst case i get a positive and i

3141
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,719
have to turn around

3142
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:20,239
and it was given it gave me a good

3143
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:22,000
excuse to visit a friend up in raleigh

3144
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,320
durham stayed there for a couple days

3145
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,760
um

3146
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:29,040
but while i was up there i

3147
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,880
just get got in had

3148
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,080
slept

3149
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,000
got up in the morning

3150
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,920
expecting to have a free day that's what

3151
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,800
the test result was already in

3152
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,880
and pretty much everything started

3153
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,800
driving everything was fine up until

3154
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,679
 west virginia

3155
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:52,079
when you get the results

3156
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:53,760
yeah so that's that's where they're

3157
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,000
getting some forgiveness um because

3158
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,400
otherwise by the time i get my results

3159
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,239
it's already expired right

3160
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,119
so

3161
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:07,840
damn charger can go all the way in

3162
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,800
got a bunch of error alerts

3163
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,960
right tip of the prong and so i snapped

3164
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,639
the off

3165
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,360
uh at first i thought you know

3166
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:18,560
something happened at the previous

3167
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,079
supercharger

3168
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:22,480

3169
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,639
know i got this little one not

3170
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,440

02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,360
no

3172
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,840
some place i don't have any conveniences

3173
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,000
my pcr results only have a day and a

3174
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
half left before they'd expired at this

3175
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,040
point

3176
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:40,320
contact with tesla support

3177
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,480
 they have they have a support

3178
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,480
for the car oh you can call them up

3179
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:46,239
texting oh well texting for the most

3180
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:48,719
part uh so you pretty much just through

3181
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:51,040
the app you start

3182
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:54,320
and eventually started texting me um

3183
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,880
since it was past 6 p.m at this point

3184
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,560
uh nearest service center was in

3185
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,440
columbus ohio

3186
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,400
um

3187
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,320
guy actually asked if i could actually

3188
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,480
make it to a service center even though

3189
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,719
you probably could see every all the

3190
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:10,560
details about my vehicle

3191
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:11,360
and

3192
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,440
having you know 20 percent battery left

3193
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,119
and actually had the audacity hey you

3194
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:18,320
think you make it to columbus

3195
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:24,000
well yeah um thankfully now

3196
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,320
i have some extra tools small tools to

3197
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,480
get any dislodged parts

3198
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,880
uh but somebody had uh had some tools

3199
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,040
and were able to get the plastic bit out

3200
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,639
and i was actually able to plug it all

3201
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:35,760
the way in

3202
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,800
um

3203
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,360
guy that helped me well he also pulled

3204
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,119
in with model 3 said oh yeah there's a

3205
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:42,560
there's been a recall

3206
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,840
um

3207
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:46,159
but yeah sorry

3208
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,560
but we're not done yet so i started

3209
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:49,599
charging

3210
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:51,199
i started ramping up on the display so

3211
02:05:51,199 --> 02:05:53,520
i'm showing them together and then i

3212
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,920
went to the coffee shop and then i get

3213
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,320
back there was no progress

3214
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,239
so you know i you know i should have

3215
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:01,520
been done by now it's said 20 minutes

3216
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,040
for the charge

3217
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,280
uh

3218
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:07,760
and it just went up i tried plugging it

3219
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:08,480
up

3220
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:13,119
moved the vehicle from 3a to 3b

3221
02:06:13,119 --> 02:06:17,440
same issue more talking to tesla

3222
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,840
eventually moved it to 4b a different

3223
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,119
circuit

3224
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:24,000
and it started charging

3225
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,719
panic subsides

3226
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:30,360
entire third circuit

3227
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,440
how did you plug it in with it

3228
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,360
uh no i got the got the plastic piece

3229
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:36,800
out

3230
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,119
and then i was able to put it in

3231
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:41,599
and then it could charge it again when

3232
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:44,800
the screwdriver was important

3233
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,199
but then i plugged it in

3234
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:56,960
and

3235
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,280
the entire the entire circuit was

3236
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,079
so i uh was a problem on their car

3237
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:04,400
no it's not the next circuit yeah

3238
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,159
can you is there a way to bypass the

3239
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:09,040
actual no no no

3240
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,960
that's bad news

3241
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,800
yeah i mean me panicking like oh okay

3242
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,000
i'm gonna have to get a hotel i'm gonna

3243
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,119
have to do this

3244
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:16,880
how is this gonna play out you know i'm

3245
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,480
in charleston west virginia i don't know

3246
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,239
anybody in this

3247
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:24,239
here uh and i'm like halfway from rally

3248
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:25,040
to

3249
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:27,520
to to windsor and i'm like what the

3250
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,760
um

3251
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,199
well put it to you this way they pretty

3252
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:36,560
much have nothing to do with it aside

3253
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,639
from having it on their property

3254
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:40,639
they don't manage it

3255
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:43,199
um and in this particular case this was

3256
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:45,280
on a wallop this was in the middle of uh

3257
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,280
there there was a starbucks nearby some

3258
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:50,000
ashoni and a hotel

3259
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,480
so it was not in the sheets or wawa or

3260
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:55,679
any other so how does one will so

3261
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:58,480
they'll get like a report from tesla and

3262
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:00,560
a check saying yeah

3263
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,800
pretty much so they're all networked up

3264
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,280
like you you have actually on the

3265
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,440
display when you're drawing on the car

3266
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,679
you can actually see how many charging

3267
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:11,280
cells are there

3268
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,840
and how many are available

3269
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:16,079
so if tesla's picking up the bill from

3270
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:17,920
walmart for the electricity

3271
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,920
i think it does separate

3272
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,920
what happens if you can't pay meaning

3273
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:23,520
that the cell phone is disabled for

3274
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:24,480
example

3275
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,560
well first off cell phone doesn't really

3276
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,599
matter

3277
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:29,360
but how would you think it's already

3278
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,800
linked

3279
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:31,920
the stations

3280
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,599
no because you have an account a user

3281
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,159
account on tesla.com essentially right

3282
02:08:36,159 --> 02:08:37,599
you have your account and you have your

3283
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:39,840
credit card linked up there

3284
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:42,159
so the internet charger then makes that

3285
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,960
call yes yeah yeah that knows your

3286
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,360
vehicle

3287
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:50,239
your vin number

3288
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,159
yank out your cable while it's charging

3289
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:00,079
and plug it into theirs like that's the

3290
02:09:00,079 --> 02:09:01,520
easiest thing that nothing would still

3291
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,119
be annoying but that's the easiest thing

3292
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:05,199
for someone to catch right you'd be like

3293
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:07,280
hey tesla someone yank this out plug it

3294
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:09,760
in like no but they're now

3295
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,280
we're not even talking about that issue

3296
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,840
yet oh i know i'm just saying like

3297
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:14,880
oh yeah

3298
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,320
the car will crash

3299
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:18,239
they're not charging you for theirs well

3300
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:20,159
i know but like you can tell

3301
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:22,159
slap their wrists and say don't do that

3302
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:26,639
well the thing is it's for the j 1772

3303
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:28,320
there's no identifying information being

3304
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:31,920
exchanged that's what i was going to say

3305
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:40,800
even though i wasted about two three

3306
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:43,280
hours fighting with tesla and just being

3307
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:44,719
in a mile panic

3308
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:45,599
um

3309
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,159
now that my vehicle was charging and

3310
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:50,719
um eventually ventured into starbucks

3311
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:52,400
nearby and uh

3312
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,239
apparently the guy was worked on vmware

3313
02:09:54,239 --> 02:09:56,719
because earlier he uh

3314
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:58,719
he was pulling in and i was just like no

3315
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:00,639
don't even bother here just just

3316
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:02,800
get out get go find another one don't

3317
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,159
don't use three

3318
02:10:04,159 --> 02:10:06,159
uh i ended up talking to him and

3319
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:08,639
apparently he used to and i still do

3320
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:11,440
have uh expensive electrical bills uh

3321
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,800
because i have four rocks in my house

3322
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,079
and his wife's eyes

3323
02:10:20,239 --> 02:10:21,360
um

3324
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,760
so ultimately i did get it fixed

3325
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:26,079
i pulled

3326
02:10:26,079 --> 02:10:28,480
when i was on the phone or texting back

3327
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,400
and forth with the tesla representative

3328
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,400
they did tell me i could pull into

3329
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,760
um

3330
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,960
either go to columbus or uh someplace in

3331
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:40,000
evansville michigan i think um or go to

3332
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,760
one of the toronto service centers so i

3333
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:43,040
told them i hope you guys have gone

3334
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:43,840
there

3335
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:47,760
okay a question i saw this in

3336
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,800
orlando i saw an actual car

3337
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:53,920
jumping a tesla how do you do that

3338
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:56,320
jumping a tesla

3339
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,480
uh with ramps or something oh they're

3340
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:02,239
jumping jumpstart jumper trying yeah um

3341
02:11:02,239 --> 02:11:05,199
i have got to expose you i can do it i

3342
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:07,760
saw it yeah are you sure it was like

3343
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:10,960
doing like are you sure

3344
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:23,760
[Music]

3345
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,639
yes there's a there's the main battery

3346
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:40,159
which you used to and then there's a

3347
02:11:40,159 --> 02:11:41,199
global

3348
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:43,440
that uh helps power the electric uh the

3349
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,440
regular stuff just like your normal

3350
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,119
based on what you have there somebody

3351
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:49,040
could probably create an adapter like

3352
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,639
the next two of those

3353
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:52,000
yeah this would propose but i would have

3354
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,760
to rip up the front in order to get uh

3355
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,199
because there's nothing

3356
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:58,480
immediately accessible to get into the

3357
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:00,239
in the front i think there's

3358
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:02,239
i think the 12 volts for something up

3359
02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:03,280
for

3360
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:07,639
electronics or electronics

3361
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:18,719
[Music]

3362
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:22,719
but yeah i i was told that uh

3363
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:24,560
uh that i didn't have any issue

3364
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,960
they would cover it um

3365
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:28,960
got got back here and had it taken care

3366
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,639
of and it took longer for them to find

3367
02:12:30,639 --> 02:12:34,280
something to do it then

3368
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,719
uh well they would have told me if i

3369
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:41,280
couldn't have charged

3370
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:43,280
so i would have had that okay and they

3371
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:44,880
probably would have brought me up free

3372
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,119
for free to come on bus that's part of

3373
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:49,920
your loan support thank you but uh the

3374
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,239
only positive part of well thankfully it

3375
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:53,920
was a quick fix so even if they did tell

3376
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:55,679
me to columbus and i had to get a hotel

3377
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,920
room

3378
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:00,400
well it's along the way it's in the

3379
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:03,638
right direction

3380
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:14,480
[Laughter]

3381
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:16,320
so you know back on the road moving

3382
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,400
again uh i ended up in the middle of

3383
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,800
 nowhere it was dark it was like

3384
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,960
nothing no lights the the cameras

3385
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,280
couldn't detect anything so

3386
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,159
um

3387
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,239
pretty much um

3388
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:30,000
there was nothing really to detect it uh

3389
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,599
it could see its immediate lines it

3390
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:34,000
could stay in its lanes but if i wanted

3391
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,320
to switch lanes it was telling me noah

3392
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,719
can't do it we're not doing this and i

3393
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:40,159
would have to take over and do it

3394
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:41,840
manually all right

3395
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:45,599
all right see you later thank you um

3396
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,199
so

3397
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:49,520
the rain can also cause some issues if

3398
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,679
it's a little too heavy i've had that

3399
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:54,239
happen which is it can't detect things

3400
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:55,920
so it's just if you gotta go full

3401
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,960
barrier you

3402
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,440
um

3403
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,040
so

3404
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:05,360
really

3405
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:06,480
this

3406
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,079
this was the scary part this was the

3407
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:09,440
longest stretch

3408
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,280
from uh

3409
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,320
from charleston to kilioth ohio

3410
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:15,199
uh

3411
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:17,440
it's estimated that i would get there

3412
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:20,239
with a 25 charge

3413
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:22,320
um if you ever happen to travel through

3414
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:25,280
here for the love of god stan 35

3415
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,599
gps told me some weird things and i

3416
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:29,760
eventually arrived at cleopha

3417
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:31,760
supercharger with five percent left on

3418
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:33,920
the battle oh wow

3419
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,440
um yeah

3420
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:38,320
uh long district uh what happens when

3421
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,799
you're a flight person

3422
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,400
though driving-wise it didn't really

3423
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:55,679
turn off much

3424
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:58,000
like nothing that i could really notice

3425
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,800
but it was just like uh

3426
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,800
this will not work that one uh

3427
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,199
i just i forget what happened though

3428
02:15:05,199 --> 02:15:08,800
i've never been that low before um

3429
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:11,040
but yeah i just i just pulled in like

3430
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:12,960
with the skin in my teeth with like five

3431
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,079
percent

3432
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:16,320
um the teslas do have a little bit about

3433
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:18,639
the uh

3434
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:21,760
oh yeah there's always a reserve another

3435
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,159
yeah but we're already violating rule

3436
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:26,800
number one with about uh draining the

3437
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:29,040
battery don't go below 20

3438
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,800
yeah

3439
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,400
but if it's like from one spot to

3440
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:35,199
another that far

3441
02:15:35,199 --> 02:15:37,199
but so

3442
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,119
then on the way back it actually gave me

3443
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:42,239
the correct row i still i rolled into

3444
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:44,639
west virginia with 18

3445
02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:46,639
was it because you were just good at it

3446
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:51,400
no no i actually was

3447
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,599
but that is a cool thing like when you

3448
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:55,440
drive faster it will adjust how much

3449
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,440
power like well you pretty much you

3450
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:58,800
could say

3451
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,000
say if you can driving at 60 go 400

3452
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,800
miles uh but if you you know it's high

3453
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:07,119
in the sky but if you go 80 you're going

3454
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:09,840
to go 200 pounds yeah the faster you go

3455
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,119
um

3456
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:13,040
really to stop and go

3457
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,440
does it does it get that energy back

3458
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:17,679
from breaking yes it does but you're not

3459
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:19,360
breaking all the time now aren't you i'm

3460
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,280
just wondering yeah especially in this

3461
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:22,719
situation we're going to highlight that

3462
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:24,480
that's true but yeah like for whatever

3463
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:27,040
reason instead of keeping me on 5 which

3464
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:29,599
would have been this

3465
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:31,040
it decided no you're going to turn

3466
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,558
around here and you're gonna go this way

3467
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:35,439
through a nick country and uh i

3468
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,080
ended up stopping here just uh trying to

3469
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:40,080
find a spot to go take a leap and the

3470
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,000
guy watching for close and i had to go

3471
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,280
well mark

3472
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:44,398
as i said

3473
02:16:44,398 --> 02:16:47,679
earlier with the superchargers um

3474
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:50,318
not all of them were sheets wallas

3475
02:16:50,318 --> 02:16:52,160
i i marked my territory all the way up

3476
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:54,558
and down

3477
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:56,638
so

3478
02:16:56,638 --> 02:16:58,000
but yeah

3479
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,840
eventually i got to uh

3480
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,120
then eventually i finally got to windsor

3481
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:07,040
the ambassador bridge which is may or

3482
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,120
may not be blocked at the moment

3483
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,120
and uh guy knows vegetarian poutine

3484
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,679
uh i was expected to get there at around

3485
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:17,519
11 p.m

3486
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:19,120
actually got there

3487
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,439
2 10 in the morning

3488
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:23,920
uh 35 percent left of the charge from

3489
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,920
toledo

3490
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:33,200
yeah so there's a blip after customs uh

3491
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:34,879
i noticed after that the cellular

3492
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:36,398
service on the car itself went out

3493
02:17:36,398 --> 02:17:38,318
momentarily

3494
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:41,200
uh 18t is actually the carrier for uh

3495
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,040
for all the cell service on the test

3496
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:43,920
list

3497
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:45,679
and i'll probably switch to rogers

3498
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:48,478
without canada uh like my regular cell

3499
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:51,280
does but no extra charges

3500
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:53,840
no extra charges

3501
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:55,599
um

3502
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:59,040
charging 110 120 is not the life

3503
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,500
um

3504
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,799
[Music]

3505
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:02,959
so

3506
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:06,478
this the windsor here

3507
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:07,359
and

3508
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:10,478
oh look a bunch of tesla's chargers

3509
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:14,718

3510
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,160
and with the pcr requirements and uh and

3511
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,920
uh tolls and whatnot

3512
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,080
man

3513
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:25,280
so they didn't give you an issue

3514
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,200
crossing back forward

3515
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,638
um

3516
02:18:28,638 --> 02:18:29,920
i'm duel

3517
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,200
but then

3518
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:33,679
you're like i got it well no i didn't

3519
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:35,359
but thankfully my mother lives in this

3520
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:39,200
area where i went and although that

3521
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,840
supercharger there just to get to it

3522
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,679
cost me seven to eleven percent of my

3523
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:45,280
battery

3524
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:47,280
yeah

3525
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,840
yeah so uh

3526
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:51,679
yeah like uh circuit most possible uh my

3527
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:53,679
mother's place in belle river with

3528
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:56,240
one the one 112.

3529
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,160
plug that and she said she didn't even

3530
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:00,080
notice the charges on her electric bill

3531
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:02,318
so that's a plus

3532
02:19:02,318 --> 02:19:04,879
um

3533
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,519
now as i said nearest charleston windsor

3534
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:09,200
area is detroit

3535
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,240
uh

3536
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,000
first canadian at that point the first

3537
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,920
canadian superchargers in this place

3538
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,558
called calmer

3539
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:17,439
and

3540
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:19,439
they just announced

3541
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:21,280
a week or so ago that they're actually

3542
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,280
in the fourth quarter of this year they

3543
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:25,359
finally put a supercharger in

3544
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,920
that area

3545
02:19:29,359 --> 02:19:30,160
so

3546
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,760
some shots of calmer at least there was

3547
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:35,398
a tim hortons there

3548
02:19:36,478 --> 02:19:38,080
still functioning pay phone for some

3549
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:40,240
strange reason

3550
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:43,120
and uh you know screen of my

3551
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:46,959
so at that point 7.73 canadian

3552
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:48,558
uh for

3553
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:51,120
and with five minutes left to charge

3554
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:52,080
wow

3555
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,720
a payphone

3556
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,200
still worked

3557
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:03,840
did you put a quarter in it no that

3558
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,120
um

3559
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:06,720
you have to verify

3560
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:09,438
well i heard tom

3561
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,479
so

3562
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:12,399
plug share proving it's worth something

3563
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:13,680
to be uh

3564
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:14,840
peppermint

3565
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:16,880
um i know not if you've heard of

3566
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,080
peppermints

3567
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,000
but it's a furniture

3568
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,319
wholesaler whatever you want but thanks

3569
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:24,479
to plugshare they had they decided for

3570
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:25,600
whatever reason

3571
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:27,600
tim hortons decided to put a

3572
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:30,080
level two charger there so i choked

3573
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,000
there for about a half an hour

3574
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,359
uh tim hortons was nearby but downside

3575
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:38,160
was was a small little hike you know a

3576
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:39,520
five minute walk

3577
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:42,080
no sidewalks in the area um

3578
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,439
timmy's was technically close the

3579
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:44,800
timberwolves was technically closed when

3580
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,319
i walked in and they gave me for it

3581
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:47,760
but they still served

3582
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:48,720
so

3583
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:50,800
uh this one

3584
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,960
uh was a little bit underpowered

3585
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:56,000
30 amps and two 204

3586
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,960
volts as opposed to 240.

3587
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,160
um

3588
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,080
cable was a little bit deceiving so

3589
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:04,319
really they had this retractor

3590
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:05,760
uh

3591
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,680
and i just went it and pulled it

3592
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:09,040
down and plugged it in

3593
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,960
so you can see the little thin wire

3594
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:13,920
trying to pull back i actually

3595
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,680
i couldn't even get into my driver's

3596
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,319
side without uh straining the cable was

3597
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:21,840
it meant to like well and it was free

3598
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,319
was it meant to be in reverse or not i

3599
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:26,080
would highly recommend pulling in

3600
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:27,760
reverse but i think they're probably

3601
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,960
looking more at nissan leafs where they

3602
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,800
people just pull right in the cords

3603
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:35,200
right up in front

3604
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,800
but yeah

3605
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,800
um another fun thing

3606
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,319
out in the middle of the county in the

3607
02:21:40,319 --> 02:21:41,600
windsor area

3608
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,399
um

3609
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:44,640
oversized stop signs

3610
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:46,000
snow fog

3611
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,240
and the car stopped earlier than

3612
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:49,680
anticipated

3613
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:52,880
bigger yeah that mix

3614
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:54,800
thank you too folks

3615
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:57,840
also uh i got kicked out of fsd beta at

3616
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:58,960
this point in time

3617
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:02,160
because i was in canada i don't know

3618
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:03,120
um

3619
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:04,640
notice a couple days later later i was

3620
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:06,960
no longer enrolled but once i got back

3621
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:09,920
here i was able to sign up again

3622
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:12,080
so

3623
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:16,319
uh driving from windsor to toronto

3624
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:18,720
although i don't know if anybody can

3625
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,080
really read that

3626
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,520
uh santa

3627
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:23,520

uh no pass no ass wax faxed and waxed

3630
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,960
open

3631
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,600
because in uh in ontario

3632
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,960
you had to they were doing the vacuum

3633
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,479
passport

3634
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:38,640
so uh even just to walk me to a lot of

3635
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:41,600
places i uh i had a scan of my cnc card

3636
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:42,479
and they

3637
02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:44,479
looked at it and i just needed this

3638
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:45,840
section you care about my second

3639
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,920
vaccination right there even though i

3640
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:50,560
already had the booster

3641
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:53,680
um on my way there brampton supercharger

3642
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,640
16 stalls biggest supercharging station

3643
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,880
i've seen up at this point in time

3644
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:02,000
before it was just a dozen maybe

3645
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,120
um

3646
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,880
wow

3647
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,560
so

3648
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:07,920
took up a nice one

3649
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:10,399
online um

3650
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:12,319
because most of them are either four or

3651
02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:13,200
eight

3652
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,960
no more lucky

3653
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:15,840
uh

3654
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:19,920
some end up being a dozen but 16 was the

3655
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,040
look that was worse at that point um

3656
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:25,040
and i filled up the 95

3657
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:26,479
uh because i didn't know what the hell

3658
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:29,040
was going to happen at my hotel i might

3659
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:30,560
just leave the vehicle parked the entire

3660
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:33,120
time i'm in toronto

3661
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,960
uh but i did end up making a delightful

3662
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:36,240
mistake

3663
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:37,680
um

3664
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:40,720
so at my hotel i was

3665
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:41,520
you know

3666
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:44,800
my regular coach here that's 130 a night

3667
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:47,280
nice and downtown and cheap for the area

3668
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:48,640
uh

3669
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:51,520
pay parking 25 a day and a level two

3670
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:54,399
charger available if you get valet

3671
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:57,520
for fighting 45 a day

3672
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:59,760
but i kind of ended up at the next door

3673
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,240
the hotel next doors lot where they had

3674
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:03,680
twenty dollars a day

3675
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:06,800
and a free level two drug

3676
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:07,680
so

3677
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,840
that was nice

3678
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,720
leaving toronto

3679
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:16,800
 it's no uh

3680
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:22,479
all right winter winter driving

3681
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:26,000
girl snowball survivorless

3682
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,040
what the do we need this for no um

3683
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,040
but kept it in my uh

3684
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:33,520
my trunk

3685
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:36,399
snow can kill autopilot

3686
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:39,359
autopilot relies on the cameras sensors

3687
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:40,800
and those get

3688
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:43,359
covered on a pile of bales

3689
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:45,200
um

3690
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,800
roads covered in snow well i guess it's

3691
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:48,479
just one big line right

3692
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,479
um

3693
02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:52,640
so i can't tell where the lanes are

3694
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:53,920
yeah i couldn't tell where the lanes

3695
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,680
were

3696
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:57,120
covered

3697
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,319
uh

3698
02:24:58,319 --> 02:25:01,680
it can determine so i can't determine uh

3699
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:04,160
uh obviously in front of it but it does

3700
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:05,439
seem to have

3701
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:08,000
a heater

3702
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,439
so the dam sensor wasn't even blocked

3703
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:13,200
why are you no work

3704
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,880
but you know brushing off and clearing

3705
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,960
off you know

3706
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:19,600
uh everything started to work again but

3707
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:21,359
when the snow built back up five ten

3708
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:23,520
minutes later i

3709
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:27,359
you know you autopilot the activates

3710
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:28,880
so

3711
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:30,640
32 fahrenheit out

3712
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:33,199
there snow

3713
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:37,240
some more snow shots

3714
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:42,960
uh returning home thankfully uneventful

3715
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,840
uh

3716
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,280
one thing i was watching was my tire

3717
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:46,479
pressure

3718
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:48,479
uh it was kind of

3719
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:50,479
funny to see go from

3720
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:53,280
47 psi even though the tires were rated

3721
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,960
for uh

3722
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:57,040
uh 45

3723
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:59,920
um but when warmed up because tires do

3724
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:02,479
warm up and the psi goes up

3725
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:05,120
uh so it went up to 47 and then dropped

3726
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:08,479
all the way down to uh to forty and then

3727
02:26:08,479 --> 02:26:10,560
once i got back down here it was back to

3728
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,319
forty five

3729
02:26:12,319 --> 02:26:13,840
the uh it'll

3730
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,200
it'll alert

3731
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:17,280
around 37 psi

3732
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:18,720
um

3733
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:21,600
although to note uh in ice and snow

3734
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,359
conditions it's actually all right to

3735
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:24,160
have

3736
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:26,720
uh your tires a little bit low

3737
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:28,240
just so that makes more traction to the

3738
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:30,479
road

3739
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:34,880
i've had quite a few issues with this

3740
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:37,039
car

3741
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,319
covered the charging port issue

3742
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:42,800
gps issues when i first got the vehicle

3743
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,040
that damn gps wouldn't start uh would

3744
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:46,000
just

3745
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:46,880
stop

3746
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:48,479
i always think i was in my at my house

3747
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:51,359
because we're out of parking

3748
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:54,800
and you can't go over 35 miles an hour

3749
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:55,920
no

3750
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:59,840
at all or on autopilot

3751
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:01,280
actually

3752
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:02,399
um

3753
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:04,720
took them two rounds to fix it but at

3754
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:07,520
least uh you know they have a little

3755
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:09,200
truck that they sent to your house and

3756
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,720
that they try that first before you

3757
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,080
actually have to go to the dealership

3758
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:14,640
and get the big guns out essentially

3759
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:17,359
and i haven't had a problem since

3760
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:19,439
there are shields they know they have a

3761
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:21,280
 problem

3762
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,680
uh i've had three covered

3763
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,640
um even after then admitting

3764
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:29,120
all the models seem to have this issue

3765
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:31,920
uh and i while i was there getting these

3766
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:34,080
fit this issue fixed

3767
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:36,160
uh hurt other people

3768
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:38,080
having the exact same issue

3769
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,880
uh damp covers keep on falling off

3770
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,920
uh i've probably spent 600 of my own my

3771
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:45,680
own money getting this fixed

3772
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:47,520
and even though

3773
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:48,960
i have yet to do it but there's

3774
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:51,840
apparently a metal aeroshield kit that i

3775
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,680
can buy

3776
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:55,680
it's the aeroshoot that's the

3777
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:57,359
essentially the cover underneath the

3778
02:27:57,359 --> 02:27:59,359
vehicle that protects it from all the

3779
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:02,479
debris and water and whatnot

3780
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:04,080
um

3781
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,439
so

3782
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:08,319
totally worth autopilot's fully worth it

3783
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:10,399
uh generally more more relaxing even

3784
02:28:10,399 --> 02:28:11,760
though it caught you know

3785
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:14,319
i've got some gripes but

3786
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:17,200
i have less driving fatigue

3787
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:18,399
um

3788
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:19,760
how you have to plan your trips a little

3789
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:22,479
bit more you can't just charge anywhere

3790
02:28:22,479 --> 02:28:24,240
um

3791
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:26,399
and generally like prices

3792
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:28,720
the supercharging can vary by time of

3793
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:30,880
day and state or region

3794
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:32,000
like uh

3795
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,240
found that georgia into north carolina

3796
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:36,720
would be cheap

3797
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:41,040
their service needs some improvements

3798
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,319
um especially with unrealistic uh or

3799
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:46,560
just plain ignorant uh

3800
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:49,280
service advisors

3801
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,359
and now q a

3802
02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:52,200
all

3803
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,760
right um yeah so what's the reserve you

3804
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:59,760
said when it is zero uh percent battery

3805
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:01,840
i'm not sure uh i'm sure various

3806
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:03,359
vehicles vehicle

3807
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:04,479
um

3808
02:29:04,479 --> 02:29:05,280
i

3809
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:06,880
let's just be honest i don't want to

3810
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:09,280
test that okay

3811
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,200
was this your first cd

3812
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:13,600
this is my first evie

3813
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,080
okay so you mentioned some of these oh

3814
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,560
 moments on the road but like what

3815
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:20,880
happens when someone probably not as

3816
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:23,680
knowledgeable like of these kinds of

3817
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:25,280
things that can occur runs out of

3818
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:27,120
battery on the road but what can they

3819
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:28,080
expect

3820
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:29,600
they can expect to be towed to the

3821
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:32,720
nearest supercharger um

3822
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:34,720
that's uh i don't know if the tesla will

3823
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:36,960
cover it or not probably not

3824
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:38,319
uh but

3825
02:29:38,319 --> 02:29:40,399
or any manufacturer because really it's

3826
02:29:40,399 --> 02:29:42,160
like you ran out of gas what are you

3827
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:44,319
gonna do when you run out of gas

3828
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:46,399
well triple a will bring guys though

3829
02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:48,479
yeah and there are some uh some other

3830
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:49,359
kits

3831
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:51,359
uh that although they cost like six

3832
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:52,960
thousand dollars

3833
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:56,319
uh but they do have uh batteries that uh

3834
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:58,640
can access what do you think of the

3835
02:29:58,640 --> 02:29:59,920
mustang

3836
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,399
or other competing evs that might be in

3837
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:05,120
comparison

3838
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,960
the tesla cyber truck is cheaper and and

3839
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,720
more well-equipped than the new

3840
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:12,960
lightning spec respect at this point in

3841
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:13,840
time

3842
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,680
um

3843
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:18,880
i find them a little bit lackluster

3844
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,800
um

3845
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,319
but you know when i got this vehicle

3846
02:30:22,319 --> 02:30:24,319
those were not even comparables at the

3847
02:30:24,319 --> 02:30:26,319
time right but what about now currently

3848
02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:28,720
like no

3849
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,720
right like when you said

3850
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:33,520
like that i'd be looking at what they're

3851
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:35,359
charging like right now tesla's got so

3852
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:36,640
much of a leak

3853
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:38,720
you know i i can actually i you know

3854
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,240
i'll face it i made it back and forth

3855
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:41,680
from toronto

3856
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,120
uh

3857
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:44,560
i'm not sure if i can do that with

3858
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:46,880
rivien like it's like initially you

3859
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:48,560
could say like electric vehicles are

3860
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,240
great for in around town especially if

3861
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:52,000
you're charging at home and you know

3862
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,840
where everything is

3863
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:54,640
but

3864
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,960
i have no experience whether or not if

3865
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:58,800
rivien has something that makes life a

3866
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:00,720
little bit easier

3867
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:03,520
to find chargers and even when you pull

3868
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:04,880
up to a charger how long is it going to

3869
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:06,399
take you to charge is going to take you

3870
02:31:06,399 --> 02:31:07,680
a half an hour it's going to take your

3871
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,560
tank

3872
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:10,640
so that's uh that is definitely a

3873
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,399
question i would like to think that they

3874
02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:15,120
have the ccs adapters

3875
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:18,319
although ford has

3876
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:20,720
claimed they can fill it up in five

3877
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:22,319
minutes even though they kind of test

3878
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:25,520
they copy tesla's homework and uh they

3879
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:27,280
put the hook for the charger up front

3880
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:29,920
even though that loop that they have in

3881
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:31,840
the charger is actually meant to protect

3882
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:34,000
the cable so if they're going to copy

3883
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,080
somebody else's homework to it right

3884
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,760
how does credit like the credit

3885
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,160
incentives work for me or owning an ev

3886
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:43,120
vehicle uh i got none

3887
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:45,439
i got none so how do you think they work

3888
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:47,359
like nowadays like the seven seven

3889
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,040
thousand dollar tax credits stuff like

3890
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:50,880
that in california

3891
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:52,880
yeah yeah

3892
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:54,720
yeah florida gives them just gave

3893
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:56,960
nothing nothing although the last time i

3894
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:58,960
got an ev tax credit

3895
02:31:58,960 --> 02:32:00,640
even though it wasn't for an actual ev

3896
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:03,040
is when uh in 2008 i bought a smart car

3897
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:04,479
for a while and that's my career for a

3898
02:32:04,479 --> 02:32:06,720
while i actually leased it and the

3899
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:09,359
government uh canada gave me two

3900
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:10,880
thousand dollars do you think it's still

3901
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:12,960
too pricey to own an eb as opposed to a

3902
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:14,240
gas vehicle

3903
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,240
uh it depends

3904
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:18,240
who you are and what you get the vehicle

3905
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:19,359
for

3906
02:32:19,359 --> 02:32:21,200
uh but overall

3907
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:24,240
uh i'm in i'm saving on gasoline

3908
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,960
although my

3909
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:30,319
my uh obviously my car payment is a

3910
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:34,560
little bit higher but i think uh

3911
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,040
somebody's trying may i slide in uh two

3912
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:40,000
questions yep all right

3913
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,600
um so question number one is insurance

3914
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:46,000
um have you noticed uh insurance go

3915
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,600
lower you know as opposed to when you

3916
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,280
use down volkswagen

3917
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:51,760
um my insurance is relatively safe stay

3918
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:52,960
the same but

3919
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:55,600
i have an entirely up insurance

3920
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:58,080
scenario with where i live right now

3921
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:00,960
uh unfortunately somebody

3922
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:03,840
was in my community was shot in front of

3923
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,520
the door and died

3924
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:08,240
and the hoa community had the ensure the

3925
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:10,240
for the common area had the insurance

3926
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:11,920
company just dropped them so we had to

3927
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:13,920
get another freaking insurance let alone

3928
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:16,800
my my regular house insurance more than

3929
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,880
doubling this year

3930
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:19,680
so

3931
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,399
i

3932
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:23,040
i'm not sure if i got uh a nice bounce

3933
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,760
because everything's going to screw

3934
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,640
sure

3935
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:29,439
and my last question um i heard through

3936
02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:31,600
the grapevine that

3937
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:32,800
paint

3938
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:35,520
on tesla vehicles it tends to be very

3939
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:36,399
soft

3940
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:38,240
so people have to actually

3941
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:40,000
out of pocket

3942
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,120
pay for

3943
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:43,920
ppf ppf is paint protection film so you

3944
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:45,040
guys don't know

3945
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:47,840
um which projects from rock chips and so

3946
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:49,040
on and so forth

3947
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:50,479
because it you know costs about four

3948
02:33:50,479 --> 02:33:52,080
grand per car

3949
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:53,439
um

3950
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:54,800
did you have to

3951
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:56,800
invest in something like that too i have

3952
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:58,240
yet to do that

3953
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:02,080
uh although i

3954
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:04,000
uh are you local or are you from

3955
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,200
california

3956
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:07,359
where are you located i'm local i'm in

3957
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:08,640
florida okay

3958
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,160
uh because i'm just like trying to

3959
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:11,680
determine uh

3960
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:14,399
if you're welcome

3961
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,640
for the most part

3962
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:18,479
uh it's been okay

3963
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:20,720
i do have a couple spots that need to

3964
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:23,600
have some attention i do have a touch-up

3965
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:24,640
kit

3966
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,520
but i haven't had uh

3967
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,840
too many issues and i do got as i said i

3968
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,600
got a couple spots but i don't have a

3969
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:33,359
million spots

3970
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:35,680
um

3971
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:38,560
so i have been thinking about doing a

3972
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:41,760
ceramic or something uh to protect it

3973
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,080
but we'll see uh so it hasn't been

3974
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,280
verified

3975
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:47,120
it's not as horrible as probably some

3976
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:50,479
people pick it up to be all right

3977
02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:53,520
that's true one last question

3978
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:54,960
one last question what do you think of

3979
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,319
ai

3980
02:34:56,319 --> 02:34:58,880
excuse me

3981
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,600
it's a self-driving kit that you could

3982
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,640
hook on to um like aftermarket you can

3983
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:07,120
hook onto your honda civic or just your

3984
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:09,040
common vehicles

3985
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:11,840
no i gotta wear it

3986
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,479
yeah

3987
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:22,319
would you say would you say that there's

3988
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:24,000
some ongoing or hitting costs of money

3989
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,120
on tv

3990
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,960
the average consumer is finding europe

3991
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:30,640
there's some hidden costs along the

3992
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,640
launch pad uh along the path of

3993
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:35,520
ownership not i can't

3994
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:37,920
say anything's really all that hidden

3995
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:38,090
uh

3996
02:35:38,090 --> 02:35:39,600
[Music]

3997
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:41,439
like

3998
02:35:41,439 --> 02:35:43,200
everything seems kind of relatively

3999
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:44,240
normal

4000
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:45,840
you know like there's also kind of the

4001
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,280
hidden cost of living in florida where

4002
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,720
you have to replace your tires more
