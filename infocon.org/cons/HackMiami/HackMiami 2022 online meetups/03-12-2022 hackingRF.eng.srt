1
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,879
um

2
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
i think it's better it

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,840
broward

4
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,200
over 10

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
i really hate that meet-up feature as

6
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,640
soon as the meeting starts you can't

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
edit it right

8
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,119
don't be annoying

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,759
yeah

10
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,560
i kid you not i'll kid you not search up

11
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
does everyone know that do you know why

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
they close the mind and subs in hialeah

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
did i win do you know why they closed my

14
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
head no i'm so broke is it rashan

15
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
cocaine no

porno

17
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,679
they must've saw that

18
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
all right just give us five minutes will

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,560
and we're gonna start it off all right

20
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,159

so

26
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
it was just unfortunate the other

27
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
location

28
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,589
[Music]

29
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,100
yeah i need to talk to you

30
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,199
[Music]

31
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,520
meet up here

32
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
hey uh you guys on uh discord do you

33
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
hear me okay and here we'll and see the

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
presentation

35
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,039
if you take some

36
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
a couple of words to make sure that they

37
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
could hear you and that the audio is

38
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
passing through

39
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
um yeah testing testing one two and

40
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,520
three everybody can hear me okay

41
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,440
can you hear me

42
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,039
did you hear that

43
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
uh no did you hear will speaking

44
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,560
all right

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,170
[Music]

46
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
we have a couple people on

47
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
discord and a couple of people

48
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,840
all right

49
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,080
so as you can probably see

50
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
we're at

51
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,639
climbing subs

52
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,919
here

53
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,880
nice

54
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,440
everyone

55
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,880
doing our presentation cyber pizza cafe

56
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
didn't open up

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
at all today apparently

58
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
and uh we had to

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,639
ditch that location and find a new place

60
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
so we're here now

61
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
we're online and uh

62
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,919
any updates we have here's this workflow

63
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,919
oh really we have to find a place

64
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
besides having to find a place for our

65
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
next meeting in two weeks

66
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
we'll keep you guys uh

67
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,560
updated on

68
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
a new venue

69
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,919
but uh

70
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
today we have will talking about rf

71
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,000
hacking

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
and uh it's gonna give us a presentation

73
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
right now all right

74
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,599
all right thank you

75
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,199
so uh

76
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,680
guys you may know me from doing the uh

77
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,880
adsb uh talk which i did at a hack miami

78
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
conference and another one actually at a

79
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
previous meeting

80
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
um my name is wilnette and i do play a

81
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,360
lot with the rf and rf technologies and

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
as far as like i've got a bunch of a

83
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
couple of tools in front of me one of

84
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
which was gonna be a little bit ironic

85
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
um it just happened to us spark up today

86
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
but uh i do play with a lot of different

87
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,680
tools and toys and there's a lot of

88
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
different methods i use for doing

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
different kinds of rf hacking

90
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
so um

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
one of the things that we had done

92
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,840
earlier also when i did a talk with

93
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,639
claymore was about broadcasting over a

94
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
raspberry pi

95
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,599
and you can utilize a raspberry pi just

96
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,160
by installing a single wire on a

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
raspberry pi in this case i've got a

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,720
raspberry pi zero and if you put a wire

99
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,680
on i believe is gpio3

100
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
and you can install a wav file and

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
running i'll put in some hyperlinks to

102
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
the applications that you can install on

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
the raspberry pi that will actually

104
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
enable you to broadcast over

105
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
multiple different frequencies and the

106
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
spectrum that i can actually broadcast

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
in i believe goes up to approximately

108
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
350 megahertz

109
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,719
which actually 350 megahertz includes

110
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
pretty much most of like your garage

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
door openers

112
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
your security gates at different uh

113
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
apartment complexes things of that

114
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,200
nature

115
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,279
one of the devices that i used i used to

116
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,839
use uh predominantly for locating what

117
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,279
the frequency that was actually being

118
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
utilized is a frequency counter and i

119
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
will post a link in

120
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
our chat about what this device is and

121
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
how it works it's relatively simple you

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,920
fire it up and you can click on scan and

123
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
as long as you're close enough to the

124
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
transmitter you can actually locate the

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
frequency it'll tell you very close it

126
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
goes from 27 megahertz up to three

127
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,279
gigahertz uh what the frequency of the

128
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
transmitter is actually operating on and

129
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,920
that's a really useful tool

130
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
let me see what else do i have here

131
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,279
there's also i know some people were

132
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,040
more concerned or considering doing

133
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
about like wi-fi hacking or man on the

134
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
middle attacks and stuff like that um

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
i've gotten some devices like these here

136
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
uh i will post a link in those as well

137
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
and in the chat for those as well

138
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
and those are actually stupid simple

139
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
stupid cheap you can get like five for

140
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
20 bucks

141
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
and they basically run a like a micro

142
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,440
python on there that enables you to

143
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
you can run man in the middle of tracks

144
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
and just start capturing people's logins

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,160
and passwords

146
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
um other rf packing techniques that we

147
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
use

148
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
and this is the one that just came in i

149
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
really really wanted to make sure that i

150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
had this

151
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
a week or two ago and this is something

152
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
that i ordered probably back in october

153
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,279
and it literally arrived today uh about

154
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,519
an hour hour and a half ago i

155
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
called respeto about it and this is

156
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,079
called the

157
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,959
flipper zero

158
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
i haven't even had a chance to take it

159
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
out of the box so you guys are actually

160
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
seeing it for the first time

161
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,399
but uh

162
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
this is the device

163
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
and with this device you can

164
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,360
theoretically

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
you can

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
scan you can sniff out rf

167
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
uh it has an ir beam meter on there so

168
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
we can actually receive ir and broadcast

169
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,839
it out

170
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,800
and the frequency ranges on this is sub

171
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
1 gigahertz with this you can

172
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
theoretically

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
sniff copy and then like all things rf

174
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,399
if i can see it if i can hear it i can

175
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,360
reproduce it and if i can reproduce it

176
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
boom bob's your uncle it gets you back

177
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,240
in

178
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,720
so for people who want to play with uh

179
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,839
rf

180
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,560
whether it's ham radio or otherwise

181
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,920
there's a lot of different tools out

182
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
there that everybody can use

183
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,480
for people who want to check out or just

184
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
start beginning to exploring

185
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
frequency shifting or getting into rf

186
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
one of the big cool websites that i

187
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,000
actually go to is websdr.org

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,160
and with that you can actually listen in

189
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
on different ham radio frequencies you

190
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
can't transmit but you can definitely

191
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
listen in on those frequencies

192
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
all over the web

193
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
so one of the other cool devices that i

194
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
use for sniffing out rf is what they

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,959
call an sdr or which is a software

196
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
defined radio and that's what we've got

197
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,360
over here in this particular screen i've

198
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
got an sdr radio plugged in to my screen

199
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,920
right now

200
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,399
let me see i have one that just arrived

201
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
a couple of weeks ago

202
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
and it is about the size of a usb dongle

203
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
this particular sdr radio can actually

204
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
listen in on frequencies

205
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
up to i believe two gigahertz

206
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
they make some other ones that listen to

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
frequencies up to even higher like if

208
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
you uh was the the hack rf1 from great

209
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,680
scott gadgets can actually go up to i

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,839
believe six gigahertz

211
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,680
so looking into the screen that i've got

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,399
right now this is an example of an sdr

213
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
radio that i've got currently plugged in

214
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
and i can listen into right now i've got

215
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
a setup for just fm radio and i'm going

216
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
to go ahead and start that

217
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,600
when gas prices get decided it does make

218
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,959
people think a little more carefully

219
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
about so what we have here in this

220
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
particular screen

221
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
is called a waterfall

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
and once you've got it dialed in

223
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,200
correctly you can actually

224
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
like for a garage door opener you can

225
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,240
actually go on to the fcc's website

226
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
which is the

227
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,240
fcc id dot io

228
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
and if you happen to come across a

229
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,639
transmission device like the garage door

230
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
open or whatnot you typically you'll see

231
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
on the back of them an fcc id

232
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
and with this particular website

233
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
if you plug in the scc id and like right

234
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,320
here it'll bring up the technical

235
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
specifications of the transmitter or the

236
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
transceiver and tell you what frequency

237
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,480
it actually operates on so most of your

238
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
like garage door openers your car key

239
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
fobs and whatnot a lot of them typically

240
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,920
operate around

241
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,000
315 megahertz

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
but if you have if you go to this

243
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
website you type in the fcc id you can

244
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
typically see what frequency the device

245
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,800
operates on and if you have that and you

246
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
have an sdr radio plugged in

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,600
and the application i'm using is uh gqrx

248
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
with that you can pull up the waterfall

249
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
you if you get close enough you can

250
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,240
typically see within the waterfall the

251
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
frequency that the device is actually

252
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,399
operating on now one of the things

253
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,160
you'll notice on here also is this

254
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,600
little button in the bottom corner here

255
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
which is record with that you can

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
actually

257
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,399
if you're close enough to the person

258
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
that is operating the device you can

259
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
click on record you can capture that as

260
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,000
a wav file

261
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
you can store that wav file and then

262
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,240
going back to again using something like

263
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
a raspberry pi

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
you can actually using the pi fm radio

265
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,680
application rebroadcast that right back

266
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
out may take a little bit of cleanup

267
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
work with something like audacity but if

268
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,079
you use something like audacity you can

269
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
clean that up and you broadcast that

270
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
back out it should actually activate

271
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,600
whatever device it is that you're trying

272
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
to operate be it a garage door a an

273
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
apartment complex gateway uh things like

274
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,480
things of that nature so that being said

275
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
i mean that's the gist of it i really

276
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
really wish i had gotten the flipper a

277
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
little bit earlier so i could play with

278
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,600
it and give you guys a little bit more

279
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
in-depth uh

280
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,000
update on how the how the thing works

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,839
uh unfortunately i did not i just got it

282
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,160
today i just got it this afternoon

283
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
so with that being said

284
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,519
um

285
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,680
that is the gist of a lot of the

286
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
techniques used for rf hacking again

287
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,079
frequency counters help

288
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
sdr radios if you build it out and you

289
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,279
use uh gqrx which is which operates on

290
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
windows mac and linux

291
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,800
you can actually see a lot of the

292
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
spectrum with the stuff that's actually

293
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,120
going on rfys you can record it you can

294
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
analyze it

295
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,519
you can tell if it's analog or digital

296
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,360
you can zoom in on these things you can

297
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
zoom out let me see if i can

298
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,079
know where is that

299
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
um

300
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,279
it's been a while since i've used this

301
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,010
particular one

302
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,139
[Music]

303
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,800
that wants to just shift the frequency

304
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,079
you can also save the waterfall for

305
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,279
later analysis as well

306
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,959
let me see here going back to the web

307
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,720
sdr

308
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,839
this is a great one i use

309
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,570
let's go

310
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,399
[Music]

311
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,399
region united states north america

312
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
northern utah

313
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,239
hopefully this is still working

314
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
and we want

315
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,000
40 meters

316
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
so again here you can see the waterfall

317
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,560
as well

318
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,440
so this is a broader example usage of

319
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
the looking at the waterfall which again

320
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,039
gqrx can also do

321
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
and so with that like i said that helps

322
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
people explore the different rf

323
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,280
frequencies that are available that you

324
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
can either see online or locally using

325
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,039
something like a software defined radio

326
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,919
or an sdr the small sdr radio that i

327
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,599
initially showed you guys this little

328
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,240
black one here that i got this retails

329
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,599
on amazon for about 20 bucks

330
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,400
the

331
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
frequency counter that i have that can

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,679
actually pick up the frequencies that

333
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
are currently being transmitted nearby

334
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
you this is about fifty dollars online

335
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,720
at amazon uh the only problem i have

336
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
with this realistically is if i'm just

337
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
out and about i try and use this i tend

338
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
to pick up cell phone towers uh so in

339
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
some cases you actually have to be

340
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
really close to the transmitter to pick

341
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
up the actual frequency

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
so that's the

343
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,960
basic gist of anybody have any questions

344
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,559
now he could hear us do you have any

345
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
questions but

346
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
yeah did you repeat the waterfall they

347
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
want to put something displayed

348
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,520
sorry

349
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
i can barely hear you guys

350
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,000
can you hear me all right

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
yeah we can hear you a lot of clearance

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,280
but we had a question about the water

353
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,960
put that sample you saw for us

354
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,918
something about the waterfall

355
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
where did you pull the sample the audio

356
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
sample from

357
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,919
so there's the audio sample on the

358
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,280
waterfall on the screen that you're

359
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
seeing right now this this is actually

360
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
live

361
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,919
um and this is actually coming from an

362
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,480
sdr radio very much like this one that i

363
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,559
have here um i've got one currently

364
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,320
plugged into my computer if i pull it

365
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
out then it's gonna disconnect and drop

366
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
my qrx but

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
you get the same thing out of this that

368
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,320
you get out of the regular rtl

369
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,360
rtlsdr.com i believe

370
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,559
um that one is a little bit more

371
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,240
expensive because the antennas on that

372
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
one are a little bit more versatile

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,039
they're

374
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
they've got some telescoping antennas

375
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,760
some smaller antennas and that that one

376
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
is actually the one that i used uh back

377
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,240
during my hack miami conference talk on

378
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,200
uh adsb

379
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
so when you pull up vprx and you tune it

380
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
in you actually get the ability you can

381
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,678
look at the actual waterfall itself

382
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
so rather than dialing in a very one

383
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,120
specific frequency in this case you only

384
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
have to get close and you can actually

385
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
see okay

386
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,679
i may be at 315 megahertz as per what

387
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,480
the fcc document says but it's actually

388
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
maybe a little bit more or maybe a

389
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
little bit less and you can actually see

390
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,960
it much easier looking at the

391
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,200
waterfall hey will i got a question for

392
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,919
you you can hear me all right yes i can

393
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,159
perfect um do you have any experience

394
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,520
with tools like um in spectrum or

395
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
universal radio hacker some of these

396
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
tools that that

397
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
so in my experience you either have

398
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,799
out-of-the-box tools that are built to

399
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
decode stuff like adsb or some of these

400
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
other protocols or in the case of like

401
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
trying to figure out your garage door

402
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
opener stuff you're kind of just

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,120
trying to reverse engineer um a signal

404
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
do you have any experience with any of

405
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
those tools

406
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,679
um so like i said mostly using gqrx is

407
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,760
what i've used to actually locate like i

408
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
actually have worked this out on my

409
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
garage and unfortunately i don't have

410
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
that setup anymore

411
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,640
um but yeah i actually was able to sniff

412
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,400
out the frequency that my garage door

413
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
was using and was able to play it back

414
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
on a previous raspberry pi that i had

415
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
this one that i have right now i just

416
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,799
basically like two weeks ago i was able

417
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,200
to get the heads soldered on so this

418
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,760
actually has a usb head on it

419
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
i haven't tested this one out yet but i

420
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,440
was able to play it back and yes in many

421
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,039
cases you can actually open a garage

422
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,080
door

423
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
the funny thing is actually a lot of

424
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,559
cars are still using

425
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,760
uh no encryption whatsoever so they're

426
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
not even rolling codes

427
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,039
yeah yeah not even running codes they

428
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,480
just use the same code over and over

429
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,120
again and if you use gqrx in many cases

430
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
you can actually record if you have a

431
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,919
halfway decent sdr radio that signal

432
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,559
that's being broadcast out and play it

433
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,880
right back like i said using a raspberry

434
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,799
pi you don't even have to use

435
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,200
uh was it other device that we used over

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,320
at the b sites and i just had my tongue

437
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
i was just looking at it earlier

438
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,000
they had it on hack five

439
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,520
uh

440
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,600
yardstick one yes the yardstick that's

441
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,240
it

442
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
one so you don't even have to really in

443
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
many cases actually use a yardstick a

444
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,960
raspberry pi is a little bit dirty

445
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
and when it comes to the rf signal but

446
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
if you're close enough typically it

447
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
actually can work and there's no special

448
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
equipment that's actually required on a

449
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,840
raspberry pi to make it work it's all

450
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,640
software so the only thing you really

451
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
have to do is i think it's gpio3

452
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,960
is actually put a wire on there a little

453
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
bit of practicing and

454
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
getting the right length of the wire so

455
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
you can tune it correctly and you should

456
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,520
be able to get in

457
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
right because they got a

458
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,000
dax on some of those pins digital analog

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,440
converters so you can just you know

460
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
that's interesting cool cool we're gonna

461
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,080
try that out

462
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,039
hopefully like i said the next time i

463
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,760
have a talk on the hack rf this uh

464
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
the flipper zero will actually come in a

465
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
lot more play i'm really excited to

466
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
actually look at that and do more stuff

467
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,799
with it but it literally showed up in my

468
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,440
house not even like an hour ago so i

469
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,799
haven't had a chance to play with it at

470
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,760
all yet

471
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,280
a little lower to that

472
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
they're actually now showing up at

473
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
everybody else's noses as well

474
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,240
all right yeah still waiting online

475
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
yeah we i have my as soon as uh

476
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,000
everyone has theirs priority uh

477
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
next month

478
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
we should probably all bring them in you

479
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
know get our tamagotchis to know each

480
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
other you know

481
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
i don't know if they have

482
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,559
i think there's like a french

483
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,360
other

484
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,640
features on it too to connect to connect

485
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,039
them to each

486
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
i just opened the box like a half hour

487
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,919
ago and i haven't had a chance to play

488
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,000
with it yet so i'm only going off of

489
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
what i've seen on the website and what

490
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,120
they claim to do

491
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
so rfid

492
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,720
um sub 1 gigahertz frequencies supposed

493
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,360
to be wide open and i'm really excited

494
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,918
to play with that

495
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
they also supposedly have the capability

496
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,760
of hacking some type of e-tag something

497
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
i've never seen in the us i think it's

498
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
more popular in like europe and russia

499
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,799
um they look like a little like

500
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
tab battery that you use to open certain

501
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
doors you can hack them with i've never

502
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,880
seen them or i don't know if it's useful

503
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,799
here

504
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,799
it's probably something similar i mean

505
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,960

when i was working in italy in the

508
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400

515
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,640
