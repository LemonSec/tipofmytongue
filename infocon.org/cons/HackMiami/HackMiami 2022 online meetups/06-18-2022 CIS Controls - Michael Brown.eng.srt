1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,679
this conference will now be recorded

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,960
so forth

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,759
you don't yet have a say involved what's

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,920
going on so there's a website that i use

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,800
to kind of

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,799
keep me updated what's going on

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,679
but a big thing they did

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,280
uh

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,039
[Music]

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,010
you know

11
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,550
[Music]

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,280
foreign

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
now compare that with

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
this cyber security framework which is

15
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,960
this

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
federal government

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,799
that's what means

18
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,240
your taxes

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,759
so it's free

20
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,920
you want a

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,640
copy

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
but also

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,719
you know process in terms of

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
probably over the next

25
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,879
year or two

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,599
you know whereas yeah

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,440
but hopefully the next

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,599
coming out and so forth um

29
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,920
but this presentation is on this on the

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
cis

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
controls

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,080
supply store

33
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,959
so we're talking about what's called the

34
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
cis controlled version 8 which is the

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
latest version came out

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,239
early last year

37
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,040
so

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
for those who don't know me my name is

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
michael brown and i start off my

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,790
creative assistant

41
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,829
[Music]

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,000
um

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
let go downsized

44
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,239
being a security consultant for several

45
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,200
years

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
uh which was good because

47
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,879
exposed to

48
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
a variety of companies

49
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,799
writing regulations

50
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,390
standards

51
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,760
[Music]

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,879
with

53
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,480
you know separate frameworks one

54
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,860
[Music]

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,960
i left that atmosphere

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,479
you know

57
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,720
dealing with that i'm trying to use this

58
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
framework

59
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
cas controls like look at our program to

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
see

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
where we have some improvements

62
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,080
because our focus has been pretty much

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
doing stuff to be high priced and

64
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,680
i don't like that i want

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
a more

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,180
risk-based approach to

67
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,220
[Music]

68
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,039
security so this is kind of like an

69
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
interaction what the controls are as

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
well as what i'm doing with them to kind

71
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
of show you that you could do something

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,199
similar in your company

73
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,120
so kind of an intro what this is all

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
about and history and background we'll

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
go into

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
the controls themselves we'll look at

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
two of the main tools that they have

78
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,880
available for you csat and the ram

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
and then this other thing called the

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
community defense model use some other

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,199
resources in the training

82
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,009
[Music]

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
or they call it the sands 20 the

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
sandstop 20 or

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,120
two or three other variations

86
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
of my files i've got a reversion going

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
back to version five

88
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,520
um started in like 2008 it's meant to be

89
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,240
a best practices guideline for what they

90
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
now call essential cyber types

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
i'll get any more in that now one thing

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
is that they it focuses on protective

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,520
controls that are primarily

94
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,840
and they're

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,120
more um

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
so the thing is and people understand is

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
they're not trying to create what i call

98
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
a high sms

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,639
system they're not trying to create an

100
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,840
entire

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
security program so it does not meant to

102
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,039
compete

103
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,240
with 27.000

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,199
or rmf or any of those

105
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,759
what it's meant is this is a starting

106
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,639
point

107
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
for organizations who maybe don't have

108
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
a good program in place to address the

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,840
basics and get them

110
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
take care of their controllers and then

111
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
they start moving into

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,400
these other frameworks

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
when they created them and they were

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
originally what's called the consistent

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
audit guidelines some of the things that

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,280
we're looking for they're trying to

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
leverage things such as

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,039
cyber defense and looking at high payoff

119
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,120
areas they want to make sure

120
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
investments will focus on the highest

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,039
threats so let's not worry about the

122
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,560
less important stuff

123
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
they were again big on on using

124
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
automation

125
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
and they were also the united consensus

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,759
so they wanted to get a

127
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,759
broader

128
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
this group is a pretty insane

129
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,680
organization

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
uh i've been aware for quite a while

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
they've been around since 2000

132
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
and they are a community driven

133
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,280
non-profit uh they're meant to do you

134
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,479
know they're doing something kind of

135
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,879
keep the world safe so to speak

136
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
their funding comes from organizations

137
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
which is nice and that

138
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
if you want to make use of most of their

139
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,560
resources

140
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
now

141
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,400
is that if you

142
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,080
make use of this stuff within your own

143
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,599
company

144
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,680
that's fine but if you want to make use

145
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
of their stuff

146
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
and that you're selling it as a service

147
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
well you really need to be paying them

148
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,159
because you take advantage of what

149
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,640
they're great

150
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
these

151
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,600
yeah um the two things they do is they

152
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
do the cis controls the cs benchmarks

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
that's why

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,399
what the benchmarks are is

155
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,000
they're a

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,279
recommended

157
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,279
standard

158
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
secure we need to go there and tweak it

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
and change things

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,680
for these benchmarks

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
for operating systems

162
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
aws or

163
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
google cloud or what happens

164
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
what they also do is that when you're in

165
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
the cloud environment you want to build

166
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,760
a virtual machine in your environment

167
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,439
that you can get a cis part

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
they also housed a couple of ice apps

169
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
ice acts for information sharing and

170
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,279
analysis centers these are working these

171
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,360
are

172
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
different business sectors to keep

173
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,839
themselves secure for sharing community

174
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
knowledge and information

175
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,480
uh

176
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,399
so they house what's called the

177
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,920
multi-state

178
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
which is for

179
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
state local and tribal governments

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
as well as the elections infrastructure

181
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
i sat

182
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,120
so frequently organization i go there

183
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,920
about every couple of days

184
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
and so forth that i'll talk about

185
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
uh brief history on the controls like i

186
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
said to start off is

187
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
um the kansas auto guidance from a group

188
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
called the center for strategic to

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
international studies uh back in 2008 so

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
they managed it for the first two

191
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
versions

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
you know one and two then they then they

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
talked it over to scenes

194
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
which i i was part of i was going to

195
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
impression that sam had done it for the

196
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,040
video

197
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
that's not the case as i understand it

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
so sans managed it for

199
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
a couple of versions and they threw it

200
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,240
over this group called the council on

201
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
cyber security

202
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,680
um and then in 2012 you know shortly

203
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,040
thereafter this group version cis

204
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
honestly that's been the best thing for

205
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
it because

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
cis has done a lot of work

207
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,079
on the growth not just

208
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
you know coming up with new versions

209
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,839
but improving it creating a lot of extra

210
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,320
tools and documents around it to make

211
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,279
the ch2 will be much more used

212
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,399
besides the police officer

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
so just a little quick thing this is

214
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
kind of the version version seven

215
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
version eight one of the biggest change

216
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
in version eight was it was always it

217
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,399
was called sans 20 or the top 20 because

218
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
there was 20 controls

219
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,240
but with version 8 they went to 18

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
and so what they did was they emerged

221
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
some i think they dropped a few

222
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,279
uh and so forth to get it to 18. uh that

223
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,279
was actually something that i wasn't too

224
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,839
surprised because

225
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
you know

226
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
don't get

227
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
you

228
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,820
[Music]

229
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,319
so

230
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
i've talked about controls i think we

231
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
should talk a little bit more

232
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,399
what it is and i'm not sure that

233
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,800
everyone is clear about what a control

234
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
is especially those of us who have more

235
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,600
tactical background

236
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
versus coming from you know have a mix

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,720
like he went to straddle

238
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
management but

239
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,360
and i took these some of these

240
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,240
definitions from wikipedia so control is

241
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
basically the business term it's a

242
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,160
function of management helps check

243
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,839
errors in order to take corrective

244
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,800
actions

245
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
is to make sure that the wrong thing

246
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,839
doesn't happen

247
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
you know think of it like financial

248
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,519
banking and make sure that

249
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,390
you do certain things

250
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,079
[Music]

251
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,160
you know

252
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,360
you know we're dealing with it controls

253
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,519
which is part of internal controls and

254
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,959
that's thing these are actually done by

255
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,279
a person or a system

256
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,040
somebody had to emphasize that to people

257
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,560
that some people think that they're only

258
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
technical

259
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
you know designed to ensure that

260
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
business objectives are met

261
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,320
so this means that we're doing things

262
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
like managing risk we're also doing

263
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
things like policies procedures

264
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
practices guidelines as well as

265
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
technical

266
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
um

267
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,519
i get kind of frustrated with because

268
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,040
i've dealt with people

269
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
when i when they asked me about oh

270
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,519
what's my

271
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,720
control

272
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,320
oh yeah

273
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,120
[Music]

274
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
and they get

275
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
like a cold shoulder because this person

276
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,000
doesn't understand that yes

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
policies and diseases are controls

278
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
it's not just technical stuff

279
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,440
but it controls and you actually have to

280
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
have both

281
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
these are some of the controls that here

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
we have about corrective

283
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
detected deterrent directive

284
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
preventative

285
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
so if the corrective you know basically

286
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
fixes things

287
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
oh or make sure things aren't done like

288
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
backups will be a corrupted control

289
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
detective basically warned that

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,800
something happened so

291
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,639
hey

292
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,720
something's happened pay attention

293
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,399
that's a good that's a technical a

294
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
deferred control basically kind of like

295
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
deters people coming so if you do

296
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
something you get a warning

297
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,519
don't do that

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,720
uh directive is things which is mandate

299
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
behavior that's a policy you know

300
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
don't do this

301
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,000
otherwise

302
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,319
don't do this

303
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,320
that's a directive

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,079
and preventive control basic things that

305
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,279
inhibit

306
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,560
attempt to do something such as

307
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,120
encryption

308
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,000
oh you want to be in there

309
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
for doing something

310
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
there's also compensating controls these

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,440
are all the forms of control when you

312
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
something else doesn't work

313
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
um

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
so i dealt with this when i was in the

315
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,720
enrollment where we kind of maintained

316
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,839
really old systems

317
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,680
that we couldn't put antivirus on

318
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,959
because

319
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,480
the systems were so old and very olivia

320
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
[Music]

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,680
but we had to have somewhere to protect

322
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,959
them from

323
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,800
power

324
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
so what we had to do was we had to put

325
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
in

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
a blacklist whiteness system

327
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
in place

328
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,880
to protect them because we couldn't view

329
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,560
antivirus so that was a constant control

330
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
you know our policy says you must have

331
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,759
antivirus

332
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
you couldn't

333
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,199
so when you you just say like oh we

334
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,079
can't

335
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,000
throw up our hands it's like okay

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
you can't do any power so we'll do

337
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,839
this

338
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,639
to compensate for that

339
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,279
uh again i said through superhuman

340
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,040
control there's technical controls which

341
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
is what i think a lot of us use things

342
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,600
such as firewalls encryption antivirus

343
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
and so forth but like there's also

344
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
non-technical controls

345
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
policies

346
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
there's also operations like physical

347
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,319
control people forget about that

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,320
that's a physical controller a camera

349
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
physical control

350
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
and even though of our info sects i

351
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,079
might almost have to

352
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,079
worry about things like that

353
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
the thing is you need both of them so

354
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,319
you actually have firewalls but you need

355
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,990
to have to follow from your problem

356
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,130
[Music]

357
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,708
[Music]

358
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
have to have both

359
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,240
okay so getting into

360
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
control eight

361
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,679
that was released in may 2021

362
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,720
uh there are 18 controls

363
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,559
broken out at 103 what are called

364
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,320
safeguards

365
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
and then they have these things called

366
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,960
information implementation groups which

367
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
which organize a safeguard and i'll talk

368
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,520
more about that that's really important

369
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,919
now the one thing that people think the

370
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,480
controls on which is

371
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
kind of pedantic

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
is

373
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,919
these are not really controls

374
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,080
these are board categories

375
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
the safeguards are truly the real

376
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,120
controls

377
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
so yeah you talk about there's 18

378
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
controls no if there's really 153

379
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,960
controls

380
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
in 18 categories

381
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,918
whatever

382
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
these are the controls

383
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,679
you have things like inventory of

384
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,480
assets and software data protection

385
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,600
uh and so forth so

386
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,440
take a look at these or anything here

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
these are the 18 controllers in the in

388
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
the cs controls do any of these here

389
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
seem strange to you like why is that

390
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
fair

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,960
people would say things

392
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
um that would be more low level

393
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,760
into it so these are

394
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
the high level capitalists with a lot of

395
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
insiders social engineering

396
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,799
is

397
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,559
so that's great but if i was building a

398
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
complete security program

399
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,159
there are things here that are missing

400
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
well

401
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,760
there's nothing here about it

402
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,039
managing your vendor the

403
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
there's also a whole aspect that i call

404
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
the hr

405
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,440
aspect of security such as the

406
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
onboarding off-boarding aspects so

407
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,158
you bring a person on the board

408
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,919
[Music]

409
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,000
you know

410
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,869
[Music]

411
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,690
[Music]

412
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
these are meant to be essential

413
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,679
technical control to be automated so

414
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,600
there's things that are about to happen

415
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,480
again

416
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,760
not updating on the cs controls because

417
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,840
what they're importing the essential

418
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,329
[Music]

419
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
whether it's in this episode framework

420
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,960
or iso 27001 or what have you been to

421
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
fill in the app

422
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,440
um so this out there now one thing also

423
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,679
is on the on these controls they

424
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,760
organize it this way so each control

425
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,320
identifies how many safeguards there are

426
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,919
and which one are in which

427
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
implementation group

428
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,440
they give an overview of it they'll

429
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
explain why it's critical

430
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,760
procedures and tools and someone's

431
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
linked with further guidance um each

432
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,360
safeguard is numbered you know basically

433
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
and so forth

434
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
doesn't go to heat so there's no

435
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
you're never gonna see a one point one

436
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,600
point three

437
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
so kind of make it simple uh each they

438
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
go up to the title description

439
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
they will define an asset type for that

440
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
safeguard you know is it devices is it

441
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,400
users and so forth uh they also give it

442
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,840
what they call a security function

443
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,760
basically the old

444
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,280
identified detect protect respond

445
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,240
recovery from accessory framework

446
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
and

447
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,799
so again they'll know which

448
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,080
implementation we've been saying i'll

449
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,918
show you some actually scans from

450
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
this is all of them

451
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
um so you can see what they do is they

452
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,799
say like okay

453
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,000
here data protection has 14 safeguards

454
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,840
six are in

455
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
i21

456
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,960
you know then they add a few more

457
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
towards 12 total and ig 2 and then

458
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
all 14 id3

459
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
what's interesting is that some of them

460
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
have none

461
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,280
in ig level 1. i know penetration

462
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
testing which i think is kind of

463
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,559
surprising is none or in ig level one

464
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,039
which uh

465
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
but to me it's like i think every

466
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,400
everyone should do penetration testing

467
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
regardless of the size but here they're

468
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,520
almost saying like if you're really

469
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,919
really small

470
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
you know okay maybe you can't handle

471
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
doing anything

472
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
don't quite agree but

473
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,960
so i picked one to kind of show you what

474
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
they look like they have an interesting

475
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,200
but i wanted to show you one of them to

476
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
get an idea so this is ten three this

477
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,880
would be a simple one to look at so this

478
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,279
is ten which is malware defenses so it

479
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
has seven safeguards

480
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,080
three are in ig one

481
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
the rest are knight ig2

482
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,200
and

483
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
that can cover it for ie 2 and 3.

484
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,600
um and basically what it tells you that

485
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,760
is to prevent or control insulation's

486
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
red execution of malicious applications

487
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,279
code or scripts

488
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,400
pretty straightforward i think most of

489
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
us understand what antivirus is for and

490
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
these are the seven

491
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
you know one

492
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
deploy and maintain av software okay

493
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,559
that's pretty simple

494
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,960
uh configure automatic

495
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
sensor updates

496
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,640
hopefully people are doing that

497
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
versus oh you're doing it manually or

498
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
some

499
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,879
nonsense like that

500
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
four and five were kind of weird um

501
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,200
those are kind of in conflict but

502
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
basically they figured if you're ig

503
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,000
level one organization don't bother

504
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,679
doing auto run

505
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,640
or removable media but if you are an ip2

506
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,960
level organization

507
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,760
do automatic scanning for removal media

508
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
i don't quite agree with that but it is

509
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
what it is and then

510
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
if you're i feel a little too big with

511
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,720
your bigger intake you're doing things

512
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
like doing things like anti-exploitation

513
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
features and antivirus essentially

514
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
manage it which hopefully most people

515
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,240
are doing that

516
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,039
and using behavior-based av software

517
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
you know i know for myself our company

518
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
was just

519
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,799
one

520
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,720
it does all this so

521
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,919
for me if i was to score myself i

522
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,679
i was actually doing all this so he

523
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,640
looked really good

524
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
but it's it's pretty simple and this is

525
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
what it looks like like

526
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,080
the screenshot directly from the book

527
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,440
this is what it took what showed you in

528
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
the book

529
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
so

530
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,400
not too much except in the anti

531
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,760
exploitation feature they actually

532
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,480
recommended some free stuff like

533
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,000
microsoft data execution prevention

534
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
windows defender exploit guard and some

535
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
apple system

536
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,159
so but this is what it looks like we

537
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,880
have the asset types as i said

538
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
uh the security function

539
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
and then they tell okay which one's in

540
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,240
ig-1 which is your id2 which were on ig3

541
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,840
any question i would have said so far

[Music]

546
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,760
is

547
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,640
okay talk about the implementation

548
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,080
groups and these this is kind of an

549
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
important thing that

550
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,039
that was done this was actually rolled

551
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,480
out in seven one

552
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
and

553
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
this goes back to kind of more of a

554
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
fundamental thing that i've seen

555
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
with a lot of people this is where i saw

556
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,919
you know as a security consultant is i

557
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,440
go and work with our

558
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,360
clients to deal with you know and at the

559
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,559
end

560
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,520
i'd say like okay if you were

561
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,158
doing pretty good

[Music]

563
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,240
you know

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,120
and

565
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
the first thing to get back is

566
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,559
uh

567
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
what do we do first

568
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,360
you know i doesn't matter if i gave them

569
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,279
three things to do or different things

570
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,840
what do we do next

571
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,880
um you were looking at if you were

572
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,640
someone in charge of the street program

573
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
and i gave you

574
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
you know

575
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,000
something like this you know 100

576
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
yeah

577
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,960
is

578
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,329
[Music]

579
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
themselves

580
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,720
and

581
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,120
[Music]

582
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,919
i hate to be a jerk about it but they

583
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,679
basically want someone to hold up their

584
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,480
hand

585
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,440
you know

586
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
you know the priority list you know okay

587
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
that's just here's something you can do

588
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,880
and like here's anything you need to do

589
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,799
whatever

590
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,479
[Music]

591
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,080
so

592
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
that's why they developed

593
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
the implementation groups

594
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,039
so if you look though if you don't look

595
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,440
at these 103 safeguards

596
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,210
you you know they've now taken them

597
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,369
[Music]

598
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,579
[Music]

599
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,520
um so they did it in these three groups

600
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
um they did this in

601
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,799
september one and they did it such as

602
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,640
you know group one was for every country

603
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
regardless every company did regardless

604
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,399
of size

605
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,200
two

606
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,120
was for if you're storing sensitive

607
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
information

608
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,679
and then

609
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,360
three was that you were really storing

610
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,000
on a very sensitive information

611
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,679
um and then they also took in

612
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,200
consideration is

613
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,279
difficulty and costs

614
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,279
you know so if something would be very

615
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,480
very easy to do very very costly

616
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,799
let's not put that group one let's put

617
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,480
that in

618
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
two or three

619
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,840
so that they've already kind of like set

620
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
that up

621
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,840
um

622
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,600
so another thing that they had done

623
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
in the older versions they dropped and

624
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,799
ate

625
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,320
is they did this organization of

626
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,640
the controls where they had the first

627
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
six were called basic because the body

628
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,159
was like okay yeah just get

629
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,120
get

630
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,559
the first six done and then when you got

631
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,919
the first six times then you moved here

632
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,000
and then you moved here type thing

633
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,120
um

634
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,799
and then in 7-1 they kind of like

635
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
this whole

636
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,039
organization is gone

637
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,559
so it's only the implementation group

638
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,440
they've been used now

639
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,559
and this is what too worried

640
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,399
uh i might skip to the next one so the

641
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,679
idea

642
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
is probably better is so

643
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,360
they have the inflation groups and they

644
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,279
also kind of use these for different

645
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,120
sizes of companies

646
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,919
too

647
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,640
so

648
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
group one natural organization with

649
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,120
limited resources

650
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,320
and security expertise available this to

651
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
me is like your mom and pop shops

652
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,760
you know the place that um

653
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,090
probably have like one guy

654
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,280
[Music]

655
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,760
with moderate resources and several

656
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,080
expertise

657
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
um when i look at my company i kind of

658
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,840
place ourselves this year

659
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,039
mainly because when i think of three

660
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,559
this is a mature relationship with

661
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,320
significant research in the cyber duty

662
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
expertise

663
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,399
three is

664
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,799
a whole department of being firefighters

665
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,200
that's

666
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,799
a level three

667
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,240
now if i work through these with my

668
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
company i'm to look at

669
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,760
the things that

670
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,880
were free

671
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,000
but in terms of the company were not

672
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,080
the target for free

673
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,919
but that's part of how organized this is

674
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,640
like

675
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,799
what is the company and what's decided

676
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,639
why they kind of organize these things

677
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
so again here's what they did was like i

678
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,720
said

679
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
ig one of the basic cyber hygiene they

680
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
have 56 safeguards

681
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,640
they then add more for

682
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,760
two for a total of 74. sorry this is

683
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,840
some of our additional ones

684
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
and then

685
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,440
three adds 23.

686
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,120
you know again

687
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,360
one is meant to be basic hygiene

688
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,600
minimum standard

689
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,840
you know two is you know

690
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,159
dealing with more stuff more complexity

691
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,279
and three other ones they said they

692
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,200
talked about i can't security experts

693
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,279
and so forth uh

694
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,039
when i as i'm working through this with

695
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,480
for my company

696
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
i'm kind of focusing to get make sure

697
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,559
we're doing pretty good to two but then

698
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,640
i'm going to go further into three

699
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,279
because you have

700
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,039
phi and pi i want to make sure that

701
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,840
we're secure

702
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,639
and essential to cyber hygiene what

703
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,639
they're now talking about and they

704
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,839
actually have the documents

705
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,839
from them

706
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,918
here on this and what they did was

707
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,639
they focused on just the ig-1 items in

708
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,480
here but they also had tools and

709
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,440
resources for the safeguards

710
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
to give you an idea

711
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,960
this is the shot from

712
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
the mountain because we look at it

713
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,800
here so there's only three that are in

714
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,159
ig one

715
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,599
but then here's all the tools and

716
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,399
resources there's things such as

717
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,359
um

718
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,000
you know you have bitdefender antivirus

719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,159
free

720
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
you have a group policy editor

721
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,520
using the benchmarks

722
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
and other things like that that are all

723
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,119
free tools that

724
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,800
ties in and help you out so it's meant

725
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160

cis that's one thing i love all the

731
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
other documents

732
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
by and large

733
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200

734
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,480

[Music]

746
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
of the

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,720
different building blocks

uh

751
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,800
to assess

752
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,040
where you're at for the controls

753
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,119
um and so forth to see where the gaps

754
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,440
are and so forth now

755
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,320
what csat is is it's available in two

756
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
versions

757
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,160
through the free version

758
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,760
which you get by

759
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,760
blogging

760
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,040
you a screenshot of that

761
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,720
um so this is what i've been kind of

762
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,599
more focusing on is going to assessing

763
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,440
my organization against it to see where

764
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
we're doing things and so forth where

765
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,000
our gaps may be um and it might be a

766
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,119
little bit tricky that because look a

767
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,200
lot like some more technical stuff so i

768
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,599
wanted to spend some time talking with

769
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,960
you know

770
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,720
my network admin

771
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,599
and

772
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,760
the vpa team okay what exactly are we

773
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
doing technically

774
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,839
to know where we

775
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,440
stand um this is what the dashboard is

776
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,880
of course this is what i think i took

777
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,760
the shot

778
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
like earlier this week so it looks a

779
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,960
little bit better

780
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,880
um so in case you guys can't see i'm

781
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
basically i'm assessing ourselves

782
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,359
against group one and two at this point

783
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,560
um

784
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,079
so what i have to do is i have to go

785
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,839
into each one of

786
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,960
the controls and given information and

787
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,720
when i do so it starts doing a spider

788
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,520
web showing you know how we do so i

789
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,040
haven't yet gone through every single

790
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,359
one uh because i have to answer

791
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,359
four things

792
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,680
control and i'll show you what that is

793
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,160
and what also wants to do which i'm not

794
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,599
going to bother

795
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,839
because this is an assessment tool is

796
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,839
they actually want you to upload

797
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,440
evidence

798
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,240
and

799
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,839
i don't really upload evidence it's just

800
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,520
for me internally

801
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
uh you know i've got the freaking

802
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,319
evidence so i'm not gonna do that but

803
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,160
i'm basically gonna you know kind of

804
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,560
score ourselves

805
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,400
okay

806
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,590
[Music]

807
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,720
log files

808
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,839
could

809
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,839
um

810
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,379
[Music]

811
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,480
is

812
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,920
is

813
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,240
um what i did find to make my life a

814
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,400
little bit easier was i found this

815
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,319
this is a free tool

816
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,720
for my company called audit scripts

817
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,079
and it's

818
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,560
a initial assessment tool basically it's

819
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,400
a spreadsheet version

820
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,839
of the csat

821
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,160
to go by answering different questions

822
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,319
so i'm using this which i'm going to

823
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,319
feed into

824
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,960
the csat online and what i use for

825
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,000
um

826
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,839
you know like like this is not really

827
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,200
scored well because it's all about

828
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,919
network stuff

829
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,240
um but this is you know that's going to

830
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
help me make it more efficient and then

831
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
i'll feed it back in

832
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,200
um

833
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,520
what they do is that each safeguard is

834
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,599
scored on four factors

835
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,640
one is about policy

836
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,599
basically from you don't have a policy

837
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,119
to leave that one that's written and

838
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,880
approved

839
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,240
and then there's like

840
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,760
is the control implemented is it

841
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,480
automated is it reported

842
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,160
and

843
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,440
as i've looked at our our environment

844
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,100
which

845
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:51,779
[Music]

846
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,400
limits

847
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,760
so that's their methodology and of

848
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,359
course

849
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,319
and so forth so this is this work where

850
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,280
i'm

851
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,560
using the controllers that might not do

852
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,520
against

853
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,119
internal assessment

854
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,400
um

855
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,160
and then what i to use this for is going

856
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,599
forward

857
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,119
we're expecting we're always going to

858
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,599
set up so i'm going to use this get in

859
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,520
place and then next year

860
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,000
i will do an update of it

861
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,480
as part of our overall assessment we're

862
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,200
going to

863
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
real fun

864
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,280
now the next one is ram and

865
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,720
i heard looking at this and then

866
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,200
honestly i think

867
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,119
[Music]

868
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,000
this is more complex

869
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,640
because it gets into

870
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,599
it goes beyond just a risk assessment

871
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,880
uh into things such as you know

872
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,280
your wrist profile and your posture and

873
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,800
so forth like that

874
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,920
and

875
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,760
it's getting it was developed by a

876
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,440
company called hala

877
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,800
and they based on this thing called the

878
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,280
duty of care risk assessment

879
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,440
um

880
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,640
the reason why they have that

881
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,440
the scaling is we've done for

882
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,319
legal reasons

883
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,560
this is outside of the spirit

um

890
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,880
so that's where we're coming from with

891
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,200
this this with this tool is that this is

892
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,280
to help you

893
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,920
assess yourself and it gets into more

you know goes a little bit beyond you

898
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,000
know

899
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,079
what i'm comfortable for doing at this

point

901
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,280
um so i think that it reports like you

902
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,599
know your impact criteria and range of

903
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,440
impact like what is

904
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,040
you know what would be an acceptable

905
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,680
you know

906
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,480
uh what is your acceptance of risk

907
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,920
you know

908
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,520
and developing what's called a risk

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,720
register

910
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,480
um these are things that i had to deal

911
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,960
with when i

912
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,400
and what they want to do is they want to

913
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,040
use it to demonstrate that you do care

914
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,760
if you were reached or if you were sued

915
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,000
and so forth and taking reasonable

916
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,800
safeguards um

917
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,319
i would hope that this

918
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,640
this tool does this

919
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,760
i don't know if i want to

920
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,040
test it out

921
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,200
uh this was a shot from a presentation

922
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,599
they kind of did a comparison of

923
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,880
this against

924
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,760
like risk assessment like 27 000

925
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,800
risk i.t and fair and so forth and what

926
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,319
they claim and of course this was kind

927
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,240
of like scary but this is this is high

928
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,640
trust and it's like oh yeah kind of care

929
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,920
but doesn't do anything else so it's

930
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,760
like oh great because that's what we're

931
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,240
focused on

932
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,760
i is to kind of

933
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,720
get into this but at this point i'm not

934
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,680
i'm not yet i'm not there yet

935
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,960
and these are the other things they kind

936
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,160
of show like expectations and

937
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,760
you know reason have you implemented and

938
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,680
so forth and scored things and so forth

939
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,720
so

940
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,558
um that's something i'm working on

941
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,520
there's another document which was

942
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,880
between the defense model again

943
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,680
um the current version is 2-0 and what

944
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,359
they did was hear what they used to use

945
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,640
data set just from like the ryzen vir

946
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
uh they plugged it into against the

947
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,839
miter

948
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,040
attack

949
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,800
and they used version 81. i was

950
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,880
and they use it to validate or verify

951
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,200
the values of the of the controls

952
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,520
ig-1 um and they use these top five

953
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,160
attacks malware ransomware and so forth

954
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,319
you know against

955
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,559
how the ig level one controls will

956
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,200
protect you versus all of them

957
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,839
um so this is this

958
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:01,440
documentary value the usefulness of

959
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,640
the cis controls

960
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,640
and so there's other resources they give

961
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,440
all these three which i think is great

962
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,559
they have

963
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,800
a cloud companion iot conveniently this

964
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,480
is the newest one is on privacy

965
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,720
my company can i do ehit

966
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,640
is it i think i am the detective

967
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,000
so yeah i have to worry about privacy

968
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,040
um

969
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,480
this you know kind of answers kind of

970
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,920
what you were saying well then they've

971
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,160
also they've done mappings

972
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,359
of

973
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,400
the cis controls to other frameworks so

974
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,920
this shows you with these different

975
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,480
spreadsheets that okay you know you have

976
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,760
you know you have

977
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,000
you know pci or whatever you can say oh

978
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
controls

979
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,379
[Music]

980
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,640
they actually have it for

981
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,400
sock two

982
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,359
and twenty

983
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,440
um

984
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,760
[Music]

985
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,760
um

986
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,280
um again you know how would you use the

987
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,839
controls

988
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,520
this way because again if you if your

989
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,920
company's working with does not have a

990
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,480
program

991
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,000
you know

992
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,400
um

993

[Music]

994
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,960
what

995
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,640
as to improve our program

996
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,760
at my organization um i i'm focusing on

997
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,079
trying to get to ig2 i think that's

998
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,040
where we're at but i think going beyond

999
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,800
that is important too

1000
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,880
but then i'm using it for

1001
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,839
you know

1002
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,280
the ram and the csat as a

1003
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,760
self-assessment we are actually expected

1004
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,400
to do our own self-descent

1005
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,920
is

1006
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,640
so one thing i would do is i would say i

1007
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,640
go get the audit scripts

1008
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,760
tool

1009
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,800
i i

1010
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,760
i was aware

1011
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,599
so i'm going to use that first

1012
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,760
feed that into csat

1013
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,599
so i'm kind of comfortable with it and

1014
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,720
then use that to get defeated into ram

1015
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,879
and then

1016
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,800
and so forth and then we do an annual

1017
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,480
internal sra

1018
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,400
q1 of the year

1019
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,720
and going forward i will

1020
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,319
update these things as part of that

1021
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,079
process to have

1022
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,599
you know kind of a better program

1023
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,240
uh training certification um

1024
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,680
they had this course which was a two-day

1025
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,960
course

1026
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
um

1027
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,760
scc-440

1028
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,720
um

1029
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,520
ci experience controls an introduction

1030
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,839
um there's this one here which i would

1031
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,920
really want to go to this one because

1032
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,799
it's icc 566 which is implementing

1033
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,960
audience security framework and control

1034
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,880
because it doesn't just do the tick

1035
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,280
control but also gets sent to others

1036
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,119
so i'd love to do this and this one

1037
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
leads to

1038
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,440
the gccc server

1039
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,520
um i typically are

1040
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,559
you know

1041
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,000
no

1042
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,720
there is no certification for

1043
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,959
being

1044
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,880
some people probably assume so or what

1045
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,920
have you

1046
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,559
no does it doesn't make sense

1047
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,799
and

1048
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,960
you know i don't know because it's

1049
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,020
[Music]

1050
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,559
because

1051
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,520
sorry

1052
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,040
like hard copy

1053
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,880
books i think we'll give this update

1054
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,119
there aren't any other resources really

1055
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,280
[Music]

1056
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,240
so

1057
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,040
honestly every couple of days i go to

1058
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,799
the cis website just to see if they've

1059
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,040
got a date of some sort yeah they also

1060
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,599
do on the blog

1061
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,040
issues

1062
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,480
so they're a really good resource to

1063
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,599
check out

1064
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,280
i like going to them

1065
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,880
so any

1066
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,839
questions

1067
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:33,079
[Music]

1068
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,829
[Music]

1069
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,949
[Music]

1070
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,400
um

1071
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,210
[Music]

1072
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,440
um

1073
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,160
obviously

1074
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:47,138
[Music]

1075
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,240
get involved

1076
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,760
with updating

1077
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,839
you know whether there's a benchmark but

1078
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,200
you have to control

1079
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,599
you can use it you don't have to be a

1080
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,079
member you're probably going to

1081
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,400
securely

1082
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,559
you know

1083
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,799

1092
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,799

1109
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,359
yeah i want you to agree very quickly

1110
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,880
if you have done

1111
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,000
your new evidence

1112
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,040
