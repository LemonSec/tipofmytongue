we're looking at going back August the

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,600
reason we go to a libraries is because

41

is open it's free you don't have to sign

42
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,299
an NDA you don't have to go to a big

43
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,679
court where they're gonna take your data

44
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,719
or they're gonna ask you or sell you

45
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,119
anything we do the same thing in the

46
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,500
West Coast and the west coast we go to

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,750
the Martin Luther King library in San

48
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,070
Jose California is the safe it's open to

49
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,630
everybody you don't have to have a

50
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,790
bachelor's degree or master's degree we

51

just you

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,310
need to have willingness to learn and

53
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,160
this cost no money

54
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,110
I guess actual money but it will cost

55
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,000
you time you're gonna have to invest in

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,310
yourself you're gonna have to read a lot

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,900
you're gonna have to challenge yourself

58
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,630
at times you'll be tough because there's

59
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,650
a lot of new stuff that you'll be

60
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,920
learning but our purpose is to help you

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,890
our purpose is to help anybody who comes

62
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,370
to our meetings and it usually takes

63
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,170
between a year a year and a half two

64
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,560
years for people to get jobs the natural

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,200
InfoSec we're going through a crisis

66
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,820
there's no doubt about it

67
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,600
and it hasn't hit yet we're starting to

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,620
see the layoffs we do have a channel a

69
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,610
slack which is what we all talk which is

70
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,380
the percent - 27 that's like calm you

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,990
can email info at Miami or or rod a hack

72
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,320
Mohamed or info and I would send your

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,720
name body we also have a disc or channel

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,390
but this cool channel invite you get

75
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,070
through joining slack so we are still

76
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,230
testing the disc or Channel we may move

77
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,630
we don't know yet we have around 400

78
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,150
members right now slack and we're gonna

79
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,730
take this low until everybody feels

80
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,330
comfortable with slack we the last time

81
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,280
we met we were playing hack the sad I

82
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,230
think we place around 300 we didn't do

83
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,660
very well but it was fun and some of the

84
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,570
challenges were incredibly difficult but

85
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,880
that's that's what it is it's about to

86
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,380
challenge yourself and turn my new

87
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,420
things there's a lot of that stuff we

88
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,000
didn't even know what to do but it was

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,550
about astrophysics and space and that's

90
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,910
what hacking is challenge yourself and

91
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,150
think outside of the box we do have a

92
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,500
job offers channel where we I'm posting

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,019
everything it's coming remember when you

94
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,418
join that most of us know a lot of

95
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,608
people in the industry so even though

96
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,280
there's not a job posted that doesn't

97
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,840
mean I can now pick up the phone and

98
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,270
call somebody and say hey

99
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,490
is do you have anything coming up and it

100
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,139
might help you and he might help you

101
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,319
might pass the HR you know everybody

102
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,120
found a hundred thousand people sending

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,159
resumes that's I've been through this on

104
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:42,639
the last Great Recession and it was

105
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,030
tough

106
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,310
so hopefully and we talked or gonna have

107
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,560
today I'm looking forward we're gonna

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,360
learn how we can we can we can cope and

109
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,240
adapt our skills to join an industry

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,190
that is still hiring

111
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,610
I can tell you right now they're still

112
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,889
calling people left and right

113
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,349
not too long ago there was it was a

114
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,909
wrecker a cyber attack in terms of

115
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,190
details we hear about it I mean the

116
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,139
deaths that's how it is with with this

117
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,419
thing about cybersecurity where crisis

118
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,199
the cybercrime goes up so so that's good

119
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,009
for us so they're reopening is up and

120
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:26,650
things are coming back I will let you

121
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,819
guys know when we decide to meet again

122
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:34,630
in person we're looking at August and

123
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,740
then again join the mean up check us out

124
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,789
on Twitter and check us out in slack one

125
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:47,889
more thing it it is I feel like I need

126
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,650
to say something about this and I didn't

127
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,949
want to speak on behalf of our members I

128
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,779
want I want our members to speak about

129
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,900
this and I'd reach to some of them some

130
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,860
of them told me they didn't want to say

131
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,400
anything

132
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,949
some others told me they will put

133
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,630
something together so we'll see what

134
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,849
happens but I personally like to say

135
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,860
that what happened with mr. Floyd is

136
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,940
horrible

137
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,560
and it should become them and we we

138
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,180
stand in support of the change and

139
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,449
equality and justice and and we support

140
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,120
the right of people be heard and the

141
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,580
change for police reform that's what

142
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,680
should happen I mean I mean I I mean if

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,210
you go to this lock and you asked about

144
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,759
somebody being in a situation that where

145
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,490
they were in trouble or they had issues

146
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,930
with police everybody will probably tell

147
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,030
you something so

148
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,100
if any of you because I don't feel like

149
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,800
it speaking on behalf of you I wants to

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,180
say something by all means let me know

151
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,700
and I won't fully support you we had

152
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,560
some people on the west coast that they

153
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,850
wanted to put something together I

154
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,820
support her and I posted it so I leave

155
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,130
hugged Miami to get her consensus and

156
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,140
let me know when you guys are ready I'll

157
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,300
be glad to support you and with that in

158
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,300

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,200

on breaking into cyber I did want to say

183
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,650

launching a career in cyber security

187
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,370
rayne ranging from networking to degree

188
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,340
versus certifications and much much more

189
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,169
so without further ado I'm not gonna

190
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,459

six year Air Force veteran got to do a

194
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,540
lot in the military I want to say that I

195
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,280
probably squeeze out ten or fifteen

196
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,250
years of military experience in the six

197

two different places got to deploy got

199
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,470
to serve in our nation's capital I did a

200
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,380
lot in my time in I always tell people

201
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,360
that it was the best decision I ever

202
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,120
made and the second best decision was

203
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,460
probably getting out but no in all

204
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,710
honesty it was a wonderful experience

205

that I had in the military I did want to

206

attending FIU in the fall I'm still

224
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,510
waiting to see how this all plays out as

225
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,490
far as signing up for classes and things

226
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,680
of that nature I'm gonna be online but I

227
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,420
still have to figure that whole system

228
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,870
out so my masters is going to be in

229
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,600
network engineering or sorry it's going

230
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,720
to be in computer engineering and

231
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,250
focused on the network security side of

232
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,710
the house and lastly I am a father an

233

analyst I've held a number of positions

235
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,530

236
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,660
technically it will be two years in July

237
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,370
of this year that I've been I would have

238
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,460
been an IT security I've been an IT for

239
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,730
over four years now but IT security two

240

years in July next month so I've done

241
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,610
everything from junior security analyst

242
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,630
I've worked in a sock I've also in my

243
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,930
lab

244
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,170
engagement I was a cyber security

245
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,750
analyst one of two people for our entire

246
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,830
organization so basically we took care

247
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,649
of everything security we built out the

248
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,560
entire play of how security was going to

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,070
look like for our organization and as

250
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,860
the same shameless plug I was

251
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,200

252
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,110

262
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,110
the background I have the Guy Fawkes

263
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,110
picture as my profile picture and my tag

264
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,670
is da hot sauce in act - a long long

265
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,480
story but anyways let me continue so

266
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,380
here's what we're going to be talking

267
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,070
about today the purpose of this talk you

268
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,260
know what motivated me to want to give

269
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,650
this I'm going to be talking about

270
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,660
breaking into cyber I look at it in two

271
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,240
ways you have external the things that

272
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,550
are outside of yourself that will aid

273
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,410
you in getting in the field and

274
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,140
advancing once you get in and you have

275
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,920
your internal things that are inside of

276
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,420
yourself things that you have to work on

277
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,029
personal development basically in order

278
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,360
to get into the field and again to excel

279
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,600
and move up in the field externally I'm

280
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,920
going to be talking about give you some

281
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,140
stats you know I'm gonna meant going

282
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,500
over the degree vs. cert debate which is

283
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,770
in all of IT it's topic that's

284
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,570
constantly being discussed

285
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,089
whereas may details you know a little

286
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,570
bit of info on how impactful a good

287
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,860
resume is projects as well and then like

288
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,399
I mentioned internally your network Oh

289
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,010
JT not just the training you get on your

290
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,339
job but what are you doing at your job

291
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:22,819
where

292
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,410
you are whether you're in cybersecurity

293
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,709
now or you want to be what can you do on

294
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,439
your job to train yourself to better

295
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:33,470
position yourself not only to get into

296
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,539
cyber but on your job as well so that's

297
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,389
kind of what that is about your drive

298
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,329
your passion your motivation

299
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,470
intelligence and that might go without

300
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,869
being said but cybersecurity I've

301
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:48,769
learned definitely takes a plethora of

302
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,759
of different perspectives to you know

303
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,979
become the best asset to your to your

304
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,419
company you know you have to look at

305
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,799
things from all different kinds of

306
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,189
angles creativity you have to have the

307
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,319
ability reverse engineering is not just

308
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:06,739
a way of reversing malware but it's also

309
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,499
a way even from an IT perspective in

310
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,239
general how to break fix you know how to

311
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:13,669
fix problems that you run across reverse

312
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,410
engineering it and then I'll close out

313
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,189
with the conclusion some references and

314
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:21,559
resources and questions and of course

315
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,079
open the floor to any of you guys who

316
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,299
have questions and you know just again

317
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,449
you know I want this to be driven by

318
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:30,769
communication from you all so let's

319
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:36,949
continue I have to make sure clicking in

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,130
delivering value especially when it

331
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,500
comes to getting into cybersecurity the

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,970
fill is only going to get bigger and I'm

333
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,530
going to hit on that in a minute here

334
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,180
but it's only going to grow

335
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,460
there's tons of vacancies now this

336
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,140
pandemic didn't help if anything it

337
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,960
actually or sorry it's pandemic yeah it

338
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,450
didn't help as far as the amount of

339
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,070
vacancies in this field tons of you have

340
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,620
people being laid off while at the same

341
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,610
time as Rob mentioned in the beginning

342
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,290
this is a time where you have threat

343
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,340
actors that want to take advantage so

344
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,150
the need for this field for specialists

345
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,080
in this field is only going to get

346
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,400
bigger because of that as well

347
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,769
so let's continue so it

348
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,720
like I mentioned there's gonna be things

349
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,569
outside of yourself outside of who you

350
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:52,459
are that you're going to have to work on

351
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:55,309
in order to really break into this field

352
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,860
and I'll touch on that now

353
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,320
and from enemy back up there sorry so

354
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,400
this was taken from an article I

355
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,560
recently read and I have the link to

356
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,260
that article at the end of this slide

357
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,810
but yeah they're slated to be from 2013

358
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,720
until 2021 a 350 percent growth guys 350

359
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,250
percent growth in open cybersecurity

360
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,210
positions and 3.5 million unfilled

361
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,630
cybersecurity jobs globally slated by

362
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,640
2021 and what does that mean so IT if

363
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,980
you of the school of thought of IT

364
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,830
security being in the same field of IT

365
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,460
some may not be but essentially IT

366
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,460
security is having the biggest amount of

367
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,340
growth and unfilled positions than any

368
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,010
other field within IT any other sector

369
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,470
of IT IT security has the most growth

370
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,130
the most unfilled positions and so what

371
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,810
does that mean with these numbers you

372
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,599
know obviously the manpower is gonna

373
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,099
have to come from somewhere these

374
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,859
positions are gonna hopefully get filled

375
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,290
soon but at the end of the day it takes

376
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,959
a very special set of skills to get into

377
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,390
this field and I believe and this is a

378
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,020
little personal prediction of mine with

379
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,080
the current pandemic and with remote

380
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,480
work growing because of this pandemic

381
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,120
more employers are seeing the value in a

382
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,300
remote workforce so I definitely see a

383
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,710
lot of these positions is being filled

384
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,510
by remote workers you know from all

385
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,610
across the world obviously as long as

386
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,380
you have a good internet connection a

387
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,410
good consistent connection that is only

388
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,080
going to grow the remote workforce

389
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,960
filling those physicians and excuse me

390
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,340
for looking to the side I have my notes

391
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,790
on my other screen here and again we

392
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,830
kind of briefly touched on this in the

393
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,380
beginning of this talk but essentially

394
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,990
there are articles out there talks that

395
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,830
are happening of the movement of the

396
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,660
workforce from different parts of the

397
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,810
country in the United States for people

398
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,910
to look for you know less expensive

399
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,980
places to live again balance that with

400
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,900
the remote

401
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,790
capabilities that employers are delving

402
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,860
into only more of that is going to

403
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,450
happen guys you know so I would

404
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,160
definitely stay on the lookout for that

405
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,490
and constantly prepare yourself for

406
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,679
being that person that gets called on

407
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,600
when it comes time to fill those

408
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,840
positions and let's continue so degrees

409
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,330
versus certifications like I said in the

410
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,850
beginning this is an old adage when it

411
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,140
comes to degrees you know going to

412
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,840
school getting good grades graduating

413
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,370
and getting a good job you know if you

414
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,070
are if you subscribe to that you know it

415
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,840
is going to be pretty challenging for

416
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,270
you to get into this field or any field

417
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,770
for that matter you know just going to

418
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,299
school and getting grades you know you

419
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,700
have to do a lot more in order to prove

420
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,230
yourself and separate yourself from the

421
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,520
pack so that goes with also being said

422
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,679
for certifications you know there are

423
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,900
those who just you know stack tons of

424
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
certifications so you can't just all

425
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,710
solely focus on the Gries you can't just

426
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,260
solely focus on stacking certifications

427
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,400
you know you have to prove your value

428
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,630
one of the things that I learned early

429
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,320
on is I have to find ways to separate

430
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,000
myself and I'll get into that a little

431
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,610
later here but definitely prove your

432
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,429
value one of the things that you know

433
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:39,130
especially being a veteran myself that

434
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,049
we can take for granted is the status

435
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,640
that we have as veterans you know we get

436
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,809
thanked for our service and things of

437
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,490
that nature but that is only a piece of

438
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,160
who we are as a person obviously and not

439
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,320
only we'll take you but so far the same

440
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,820
could be said for a graduate you know

441
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,400
you you did definitely work hard you did

442
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,230
definitely stay up late and put in the

443
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,929
hours to graduate and get that degree

444
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:03,790
but what else can you do to separate

445
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,860
yourself that is not enough by itself

446
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,470
and you know for those of you who are on

447
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,510
this talk right now who own this call

448
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,860
right now who don't know that yet you

449
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,809
know be ready for that reality once you

450
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:18,940
graduate you know there's still more

451
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,890
that you will have to do to prove

452
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,130
yourself and and be willing to allow

453
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,630
companies to see that value within

454
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,300
yourself you know you can assume that

455
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,770
your resume and your degree is gonna

456
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,180
speak for you you know you have

457
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,760
to be able to speak to your experiences

458
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,370
speak to your you know your career so

459
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,080
far even if it's only been internships

460
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,290
and part-time jobs as a college student

461
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,420
you have to be able to speak to that in

462
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,580
order for employers to see the value in

463
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,900
you and lastly I did want to hit on the

464
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,660
fact that you know what works for me

465
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,000
might not work for you and I'm sure

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,980
anyone else who's on this call that

467
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,510
experience can say the same thing what

468
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,490
got them into the field - might not

469
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,050
necessarily be the same thing that gets

470
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,180
you into the field or will help you move

471
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,380
move into different levels within your

472
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,330
company or different positions within

473
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,940
other companies you know but I

474
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,100
definitely want to use this opportunity

475
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,230
as a way of at least giving you some

476
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,380
guide to a degree of what can help you

477
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,760
but again it looks different for

478
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,530
everyone else work for me might be

479
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,520
different for you and don't rest on your

480
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,290
laurels guys don't rest on your laurels

481
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,850
whether you're a veteran like I said

482
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,730
like myself whether you've you know been

483
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,130
in the field for 5-10 years whether

484
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,870
you're a college graduate student taught

485
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,880
graduated top of your class don't rest

486
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,930
on your laurels constantly seek to do

487
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,330
more be better and I'm going to hit on

488
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:54,030
that a little later so when it comes to

489
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,130
getting into the field when it comes to

490
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,670
stepping out and putting a putting a

491
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,010
face to a name and getting your name out

492
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,800
there your resume um what I want to say

493
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,680
is unless your network is very well

494
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,500
established unless you have your name

495
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,990
out there quite a bit your resume will

496
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,330
be your first impression you know the

497
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,370
saying goes that you only have one time

498
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,950
to give a first impression and you

499
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,540
definitely want to pay attention to

500
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,730
everything you have on your resume take

501
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,240
take time to look at all of the

502
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,060
different the different things you're

503
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,620
putting in there don't just list job

504
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,840
description actually put in your resume

505
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,850
job descriptions actually put in your

506
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,880
resume what you have done put yourself

507
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,010
in the mindset of a recruiter of a

508
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,100
hiring manager what can you do for me

509
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,419
one of the things that I always tell

510
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,520
tell guys looking to get into this field

511
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,160
and things that have helped me is

512
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,929
understand that employers hiring

513
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,179
managers recruiters are always tuned in

514
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,559
to WI I FM what is in it what's in it

515
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,950
for me what can you do for me what value

516
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,140
can you bring to this organization are

517
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,970

518
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,179
investment of my resources to bring you

put it into your resume guys I put it

521
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,039
into each and every job description and

522
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,260
each and every job that you've done each

523
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,179
and every task that you've accomplished

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,220
project that you were part of quantify

525
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,740
it as much as possible in order to help

526
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,659
hiring managers see the value that you

527
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,730
can bring you know I want to say that

528
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,289
you know maybe there'll be a chance for

529
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,390
me later on or anyone else to give a

530
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,010
talk on just your resume alone because

531
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,330
this can this truly can be a a talking

532
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,799
it of itself just having specific line

533
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,990
items in your resume you know you're

534
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,179
only gonna have but so many seconds

535
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,640
honestly of time in front of a hiring

536
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,370
manager to have them look at you to see

537
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,380
what you've accomplished and decide

538
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,870
whether you're going to go into the move

539
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,820
to the next step pile or you're going to

540
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,830
go into the you know not gonna happen

541
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,630
pile you literally are gonna have a few

542
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,010
seconds you need to make sure during

543
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,380
that time that you feed your hiring

544
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,780
managers as much hi candy as you can

545
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,570
when it comes to what you've done and

546
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,039
learning how to better do that over your

547
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,700
career and my personal experience I've

548
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,480
learned that it helps more than anything

549
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,570
to set times to go back into your resume

550
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,760
to set times whether it's every few

551
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,890
weeks or better yet a few you know every

552
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,020
month or two going back in it updating

553
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,230

there as far as projects you've done as

555
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,640

556
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,350

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,570

are things that need to be updated but

566
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,539
every accomplishment every that every

567
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,059
piece of value that you can give or have

568
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,590

opportunity presents itself or someone

572
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:16,869

579
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,389
and of course LinkedIn you see the image

580
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:34,389
I put there LinkedIn is extremely

581
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,970
important as well you know that platform

582
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,099
is only going to grow you know that is

583
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,739
aside from your resume that is your next

584
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,320
you know level of impression that hiring

585
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,149
managers recruiters are going to get

586
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,440
from you is through your LinkedIn

587
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,570
profile so definitely make sure you're

588
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,729
paying attention to that you're doing

589
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,889
your due diligence updating it you know

590

putting relevant information projects

591
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,759
conferences all of these things matter

592
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,279
I'll hit on that more later but that was

593
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,989
things that were not necessarily told to

594
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:03,129
me in the beginning I had to learn it

595
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,440
over time and I hope that you know I'm

596
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,989
giving you guys enough value so that you

597
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,149
can you know apply it to your career as

598
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,059
well and again I'm seeing a few comments

599
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,039
here definitely want to again mention

600
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,989
we'll have plenty of time at the end to

601
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:22,989
go into you know questions and just talk

602
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:25,419
at the end but yeah like I said LinkedIn

603
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:32,909
pay special attention to that project

604
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:35,369
projects what I wanted to say here um

605
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,119
with projects definitely find ways guys

606
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,820
even if you're not in the field yet what

607
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,499
again what happened what worked for me

608
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:47,700
was getting as much experience as I

609
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,769
could in projects that were either

610
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:52,229
presented to me or I caught wind of and

611
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:54,960
I informed my leadership at the time

612
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,549
that I could help and this is what I

613
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:59,070
could do anything that you can take part

614
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,080
in that you can document what your

615
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,419
impact was what that the outcome of that

616
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,029
project was will help you add it to your

617
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,080
LinkedIn add it to your resume add it to

618
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,389
your blog site wherever you can get your

619
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:14,220
name out wherever someone can find you

620
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,950
click add it to your YouTube even you

621
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,470
know talk about it so that way hiring

622
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,450
managers can get a better picture of

623
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,330
okay this is a serious individual when

624
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,649
it comes to this career field they're

625
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:27,989
not just looking to clock in and clock

626
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,729
out every day they are truly passionate

627
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:33,119
about what we do here what they do and

628
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,759
they look like a more worthwhile

629
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,340
candidate and this all and our we go

630
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,129
back over this but this all goes into

631
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:42,779
separating yourself and standing out

632
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,340
guys again quantify quantify as much as

633
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,049
you can you know that's something I'm

634
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,539
still learning to this day when I was in

635
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,830
the military I had to give a lot of

636
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,619
different feedbacks and I had to give

637
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:57,720
reports and reviews on the guys who are

638
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,059
assigned to me and part of doing that

639
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,659
was quantifying that individuals impact

640
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,080
in our team and having that troop

641
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,779
understand that they need to do that for

642
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,460
themselves so that they can make my job

643
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,859
easier so likewise guys when you're

644
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,659
working on your resume when you're

645
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,820
working on your LinkedIn make it easier

646
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,440
for the hiring managers and recruiters

647
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,629
to find that information out about you

648
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:24,359
what kind of impact not not it's not all

649
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,109
about just what you did but what impact

650
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:32,249
did what you did have what percentage of

651
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,950
money did you save your company how much

652
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,979
money how fast you know six months

653
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:40,109
faster we got this project finished a

654
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,299
year however much time you save the

655
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:42,690
company

656
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,820
those are things hiring managers love to

657
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,570
see recruiters love to see

658
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,340
and I would impress upon you to

659
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,500
definitely take note of that if you've

660
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,840
not done that yet make that a part make

661
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,690
a mental note to continuously do that

662
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,860
documenting everything you've done every

663
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,990
project you've taken a part of taking

664
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,600
part in and add it to you know your

665
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,919
resume your Linkedin and where people

666
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:03,700
can see you

667
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,320
and of course internships you know

668
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,669
especially for my college students here

669
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,769
and even those who are in between right

670
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:14,080
now such as myself and those who are

671
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,669
looking to make the jump into IT

672
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,340
security look for opportunities to do

673
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,789
that as well doesn't have to be it

674
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,460
doesn't have to be external to your

675
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,080
organization if you're currently working

676
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,299
right now possibly look to have an

677
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,570
internship internally to shadow others

678
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,580
if you're fortunate enough to be in an

679
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,350
organization where you may say for

680
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,419
instance you're a helpdesk or you're in

681
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,009
some other department but you have a

682
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,990
passion for security and you have a

683
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,210
passion for getting into that field see

684
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,730
about what you can do to shadow others

685
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,769
who are in the field intern underneath

686
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,110
them you know take some time to learn

687
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,570
the ropes so to speak and again that's

688
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,220
helping you to get your name out there

689
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,309
to show how serious you are about this

690
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:59,169
field you know hiring managers for what

691
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,830
I've learned love nothing more than

692
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,669
individuals who are passionate about

693
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,860
what they're doing because that gives

694
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,629
them the assurity that you're a good

695
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,820
asset that you you're a good investment

696
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,549
you're not here just to you know make a

697
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,110
quick buck or because you hear all these

698
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,759
stats and numbers about how big the

699
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,950
field is getting you see the individuals

700
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,379
you know individuals making 100k plus in

701
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,509
the field it takes a lot of passion to

702
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:23,889
get there guys and you definitely want

703
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,649
to invest that into your field into your

704
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:32,500
career as well as early as possible so

705
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,330
like I mentioned that was the external

706
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,669
side of things there's the internal what

707
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,629
can you do within yourself you know

708
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,740
personal development think personal

709
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,029
development what can you do within

710
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,789
yourself to stand out to get you into

711
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:49,960
the field and excuse me if I'm you know

712
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,090
talking too fast you know I would

713
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,500
definitely wouldn't mind slowing down I

714
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,570
definitely just want to make the most

715
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,980
use of the time that we have together

716
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,630
today as humanly possible

717
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,090
and I made a little typo here Network

718
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,730
equals net worth is what I meant to say

719
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,840
so sorry about that

720
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,350
networks equals net worth so what does

721
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,700
that mean that means that it's not about

722
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,860
what you know and it's not about who you

723
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,550
know it's more about who knows you so

724
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,980
the more you get your name out there the

725
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,870
more you're able to present yourself

726
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,510
into in front of more people I would

727
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,310
even say doing things like this you know

728
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,490
a lot of people especially in this field

729
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,500
and IT in general you know we're we're

730
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,550
kind of to ourselves a lot and I'm

731
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,410
getting a notification of my network

732
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,940
connection not being the greatest so

733
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,160
please let me know ok let yeah please

734
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,750
let me know if you're having a hard time

735
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,340
hearing me or seeing me I just got a

736
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,050
little notification about my network but

737
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,730
I'll just continue if no one has any

738
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,230
issues with my connection right now but

739
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,720
as I mentioned your network is your net

740
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,830
worth so you know who you knows you you

741
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,780
know what hiring managers know you what

742
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,300
directors know you what see Zoe's know

743
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,050
you CIOs founders you know get your name

744
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,860
out there exchange information and I put

745
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,830
here give value guys you know this might

746
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,570
go without being said but for some of

747
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,530
you who are maybe new to the field again

748
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,330
college graduate so you might not just

749
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,280
have ever come across this concept but

750
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,010
when it comes to networking guys is way

751
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,550
better when you it's all it is extremely

752
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,980
valuable to give value you know don't

753
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,050
seek to only establish connections with

754
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,880
people and to get from them an

755
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,100
opportunity for a job but actually look

756
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,620
to see how you can help that individual

757
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,060
out maybe there's a project they're

758
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,820
working on and you might be better at

759
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,890
some aspect of that project that they're

760
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,810
not good at we actually were just

761
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,520
talking about that when it came to

762
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,260
sequel and databases and things of that

763
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,460
nature for someone who has a has a task

764
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,870
that they're working on you know maybe

765
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,390
you can you know see in their twitter

766
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,660
twitter twitter sorry in their tweet

767
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,820
they might mention they're having some

768
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,770
challenges with this part of their

769
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,120
project you know they might ask

770
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,380
questions you know I subscribe to

771
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,940
you know you guys if you don't already

772
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,520
subscribe to channels like Spiceworks or

773
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,430
sites like Spiceworks or hack miami of

774
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,220
course and other networking platforms so

775
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,210
that you could be a part of the

776
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,000
conversation but again give values so

777
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,770
that way it's not only that you're

778
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,420
trying to seek out opportunities but

779
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,400
opportunities will seek you out because

780
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,500
of the individual you've painted

781
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,140
yourself to be by giving value to others

782
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,060
that will only help to grow your next

783
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,880
your network exponentially guys so

784
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,300
definitely you definitely definitely pay

785
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,660
attention to giving value on the job

786
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,200
training so guys just use me back up so

787
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,810
yeah on-the-job training as I mentioned

788
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,520
before it's not just about the training

789
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,310
you receive for the job you have at hand

790
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,650
when I say on-the-job training and the

791
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,960
reason I made this slide here is so that

792
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,899
you guys can understand train not just

793
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,730
for the job you have but for the job you

794
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,250
want and if it can have any uh

795
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,719
relativity to what you're doing if your

796
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,760
helpdesk if you're a sysadmin but you

797
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,440
know you have a passion for security

798
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,300
that's what you want to get into find

799
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,760
ways to incorporate security principles

800
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,350
if you're building out a website you

801
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,639
obviously want to pay attention to the

802
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,679
web at the OWASP

803
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,610
o LW ASP top ten find ways to secure and

804
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,639
harden that site that web application

805
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,750
you guys when you're dealing with

806
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,399
databases you know even if you're not a

807
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,090
database security admin so to speak

808
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,040
security is in all of our lives what you

809
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,199
can whether you see that or not so find

810
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,750
ways to incorporate these things into

811
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,989
your daily job so that way you can again

812
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:57,330
stand out add it to your resume add a

813
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,460

814
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,670
it a part of who you are like always be

815
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,500
learning in sales there's always be

816
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,480
closing I believe in IT and IT security

817
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,940
especially because of how how many

818
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,070
things change how quickly our our our

819
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,540
landscape contains look at this pandemic

820
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,130
how many things have happened you know

821
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,250
you guys might not be privy right now to

822
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,800
a lot of the activity the the ransoms

823
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,940
that are happening where I

824
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,010
now ransomware and things of that nature

825
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,349
but guys when things like this happened

826
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:33,510
it's only a matter of time so you have

827
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,700
to always be learning always open your

828
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,069
your mind to the newest vulnerabilities

829
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,339
like be cognizant of what is happening

830
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,280
in the world you know one of the things

831
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,950
I not 100% sure if I put this into

832
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,980
another slide but reddit's reddit forums

833
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,579
and definitely I did listed in another

834
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,160
slide so a few sites that you can use

835
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,569
Krebs on security things of that nature

836
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:00,780
to stay cognizant of what is happening

837
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,710
you know find ways to use those tidbits

838
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,900
of information obviously with the

839
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,369
appropriate approvals and change

840
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,920
management in your current organization

841
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,200
that will go so far that will take you

842
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,900
so far when you do that you know

843
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,089
incorporate that into your lifestyle

844
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,670
always be learning always stay ahead of

845
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,250
what is happening volunteer guys you

846
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,540
know one of the things that I learned in

847
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,760
the military is never volunteer but that

848
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,560
couldn't be further from the truth in IT

849
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,839
security to be completely transparent

850
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,680
with you all find ways to give time give

851
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,140
value in in the form of on-the-job

852
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,200
training like what can you do to stand

853
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,630
out and be more of an asset to your

854
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,030
current company so that way you could

855
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,180
again be noticed have more to add to

856
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,700
your own like I said resume and wherever

857
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,940
people can find you at and you can make

858
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,010
that a part of your internal you know

859
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,140
you know motivation but I always find

860
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,480
ways to give value and of course

861
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,910
document again this is something I had

862
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,040
to learn early on an excuse me and now

863
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,420
he's talking so much but this is

864
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,010
something I learned early on guys like

865
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,290
document everything that you do and

866
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,150
quantify it as best you can

867
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,910
you know have a notepad OneNote whatever

868
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,400
you use to take notes with document

869
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,740
document document so that way there's

870
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,810
never an issue with remembering I never

871
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,210
trust my mind I've never trust my memory

872
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,150
with what I've done like this field

873
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,760
gives you plenty of opportunities IT in

874
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,470
general honestly but IT security

875
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,869
especially gives you plenty of

876
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:36,780
opportunities to learn and to take on

877
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,210
challenges so I will be it will behoove

878
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,770
you to write it all down

879
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,560
you know you guys who are already in the

880
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,480
field give tons of value every day you

881
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,950
protect your infrastructures you're

882
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,630
protecting your companies you do a lot

883
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,910
and it would only make sense that you

884
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,860
document at all and quantify it as best

885
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,320
you can

886
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,010
all righty moving on Drive so again

887
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,590
internal these are the things these are

888
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,830
the concepts that you need to have

889
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,200
within yourself again to break into the

890
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,620
field so your drive is huge your

891
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,510
motivation why do you want to get into

892
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,180
this field for me guys the reason I

893
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,400
wanted to get in it took a long time I'm

894
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,900
gonna be completely honest with you it

895
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,400
took a long time for me to understand

896
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,710
and know you know as I'm sure it is with

897
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,680
you a lot of you here what I wanted to

898
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,120
do in life I knew I wanted to work with

899
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,890
computers but I didn't know exactly how

900
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,900
I came out of high school Computer

901
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,030
Engineering looked amazing the math did

902
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,600
not so I quickly turned away from

903
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,250
computer engineering all the way up

904
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,650
until I got out of the military cyber

905
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,390
security started becoming bigger and

906
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,240
bigger I got out back in 2013 more and

907
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,470
more schools started incorporating

908
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,670
cybersecurity programs and you know

909
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,440
certifications and just the job market

910
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,450
in general started expanding with more

911
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,370
and more cybersecurity roles and I

912
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,020
realize hey you know I see all these

913
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,470
hacker movies mr. robot and different

914
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,940
things that I nature you know I would

915
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,860
love to be in the position to help

916
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,140
protect companies and their assets to

917
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,750
learn of all the skills that are needed

918
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,000
to do that so that's what motivated me

919
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,610
to be able to give back and like I said

920
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,130
my thing is I love to deliver value I

921
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,130
love to give so in order to do that from

922
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,030
an IT security perspective I wanted to

923
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,620
give back in the form of helping

924
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,510
organizations protect themselves your

925
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,700
belief system matters as well guys so

926
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,260
what do you believe do you believe you

927
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,030
can be successful in this field you have

928
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,400
to have that core belief within you you

929
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
know there's tons of people who have a

930
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,280
lot more experience you see these guys

931
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,770
who you know get bug bounties for 100k I

932
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,690
think I saw our article recently for

933
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,480
Apple where someone got 100k bug bounty

934
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,040
you think man I can never do that it

935
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,620
just seems like so is so big of a thing

936
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,120
to do but everybody starts from

937
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,590
somewhere guys and you have to believe

938
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,190
within yourself that

939
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,890
you can do that as well if that's what

940
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,810
you aim to be you might want to be a

941
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,370
sizzle you might want to be a

942
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,350
co-director of security you might want

943
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,180
to found your own company you have to

944
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,950
believe it within yourself that you can

945
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,830
do that and of course independent

946
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,700
education as I mentioned a slide ago

947
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,430
find ways to keep yourself engaged in

948
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,680
what is happening learning always be

949
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,080
learning keep yourself engaged with the

950
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,510
conversation of cybersecurity hacker

951
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,690
news as I mentioned before staying a

952
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,660
part of reddit conversations that are

953
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,130
happening over there concerning IT

954
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,050
security ransomware

955
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,360
malware you know what are the newest

956
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,940
apts advanced persistent threats that

957
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,580
are out there you know stay cognizant of

958
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,100
it guys that's what helps me and what I

959
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,720
would has helped others that I have

960
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,760
learned from mentors of mine they're

961
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,770
always learning the most successful

962
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,330
people I've seen in this field a little

963
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,790
are those who are always so to speak

964
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,620
having their ear to the street of what

965
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,480
is happening in cybersecurity krebbs own

966
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,330
security and nick its acuity are another

967
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,820
two other platforms that will help you

968
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,130
to stay informed and stay abreast of

969
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,690
what is happening so that definitely is

970
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,180
a part of your drive and I did want to

971
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,970
give a quick little story a counterpart

972
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,920
of mine a former counterpart of mine I

973
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,910
would say his drive is beyond crazy like

974
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,300
within I would say four to five years he

975
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,460
went from having no background in IT

976
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,700
security at all to now being a senior

977
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,280
threat hunter at his organization he

978
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,010
went from I believe and you know not to

979
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,330
put his business out I don't know

980
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,430
exactly but I want to say probably 40 50

981
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,830
K a year now he's making well over a

982
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,540
hundred K in the last four to five years

983
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,390
because of his drive he went from no

984
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,450
certifications he went and got his two

985
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,340
red hat certifications he worked with

986
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,250
Splunk which is another amazing tool to

987
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,570
get experienced and if you don't already

988
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,770
have it he has a security plus OSCE are

989
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,310
some sour OS CP and OSCE certifications

990
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,720
and he also just stays abreast he has a

991
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,660
github page you know so that's an

992
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,160
example like I mention of an individual

993
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,559
who has that drive so again you want to

994
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,030
separate yourself you want to always be

995
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,250
learning that will only help you not

996
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,200
hurt you in getting in this field and

997
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,569
excelling in this field guys so always

998
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:22,930
always look for ways to continue your

999
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:29,130
independent education continuing on here

1000
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,670
so this might go without saying but your

1001
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,250
intelligence guys you know when you get

1002
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,640
into the IT IT security especially you

1003
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,760
really have to tap in to how you look at

1004
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,500
a problem you know when you are

1005
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,210
presented with an issue when you're

1006
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,069
presented with an alert when you're

1007
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:50,859
presented with an apt malware something

1008
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,440
you've never seen out in the wall before

1009
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,210
you have to find ways to break that

1010
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,630
problem down to understand how did it

1011
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,460
happen to who what who what when where

1012
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,190
and why to that problem you know and

1013
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,690
again it's my goal without being said

1014
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,309
but you really you know this is not a

1015
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:09,130
field for those who are just gonna have

1016
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,980
a constant mindset of you know day in

1017
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,990
day out clock in go home you know make

1018
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,579
up make your paycheck and go home like

1019
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:17,770
you really have to invest in yourself

1020
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,190
and use your intellect to break down the

1021
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,420
problems that you're presented with

1022
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,279
you know reverse engineering is not just

1023
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:27,160
a phrase used with malware guys you know

1024
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,869
you have to be able to take a problem

1025
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:31,510
and work backwards from it especially

1026
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,119
for you guys who are in IT who work

1027
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,710
helpdesk you're presented with issues

1028
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,380
every day you obviously will get used to

1029
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,510
certain issues happening all the time

1030
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,220
but there comes a time where you present

1031
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,150
with something you've never seen before

1032
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,119
you have to what reverse engineer you

1033
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,190
have to work backwards in order to break

1034
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,549
it down and come to a solution so that

1035
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:54,250
all dowels into being creative your

1036
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,809
creativity is beyond beyond your

1037
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,599
education beyond your network how you

1038
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,460
break down a problem is extremely

1039
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,339
important guys so your creativity can

1040
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:07,510
you look at this from a different

1041
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,670
perspective you know one of the things I

1042
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,829
love about our field is how broad it can

1043
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,900
be you have guys who are guys and girls

1044
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,730
who are in social engineering like that

1045
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,240
is their forte it has nothing to do with

1046
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,930
the

1047
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,839
best scenes and source solutions and

1048
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:24,609
programs and malware defendant has

1049
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:25,660
nothing to do with that it has

1050
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,109
everything to do with being creative

1051
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:31,750
talking to an individual to draw draw

1052
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,930
out information from them in order to

1053
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,700
sort of speak hack into their

1054
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,609
environment so creativity from all

1055
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:42,549
aspects of this field will definitely

1056
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,109
benefit you and of course being a

1057
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:46,569
problem solver you cannot give up one of

1058
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,339
the things I love about offensive

1059
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,020
security I mentioned two of their source

1060
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,020
already the OSCE and the OSC P their

1061
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,829
phrase is try harder guys be a

1062
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:59,920
problem-solver never give up CTFs might

1063
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,329
be your best friend if you're looking at

1064
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:02,680
getting into this field if you're

1065
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,930
looking to get into this field because

1066
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,240
they push you to do that they push you

1067
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,599
to learn they push you to grab onto new

1068
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,180
technologies and new just things that

1069
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,890
you've never known about before for me

1070
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,630
that's what that's what it does from you

1071
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,910
I never knew I never really deep delve

1072
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,250
into steganography until I started

1073
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,980
working on cts that required me to do

1074
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,299
that you know I'm saying so you

1075
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:27,880
definitely have to have being a problem

1076
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,180
solver a part of your DNA to both get in

1077
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:37,510
and excel in this field and with that

1078
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,599
being said here is my last bit of

1079
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:44,680
information I want to pass on discipline

1080
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,710
discipline discipline again this may be

1081
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,020
something that goes without being said

1082
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,430
but you definitely want to be

1083
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,900
disciplined when it comes to this field

1084
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,760
guys you want to be able to put your

1085
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,779
head down when it comes to these

1086
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:57,369
certifications when it comes to your

1087
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:59,680
your degrees or your knowledge your

1088
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,410
independent education you have to be

1089
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,069
disciplined enough to to learn it and to

1090
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:08,349
grow from it and to apply it to what you

1091
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,529
do day in and day out you know I can't

1092
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:14,260
stress enough like one of my favorite

1093
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,710
sayings is the pain of discipline is far

1094
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,160
less than the pain of regret and I say

1095
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,829
that because and I wanted to mention

1096
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:27,309
this a little earlier but if you are

1097
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:29,619
serious about getting into IT security

1098
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,359
eyes if you're serious about getting

1099
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,119
into cybersecurity you

1100
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,549
to break into this field find a way to

1101
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:38,099
do it as soon as possible because

1102
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,230
there's a lot to learn there's a lot to

1103
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,269
gain there's a lot of growth that will

1104
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,999
happen in this field but you will but if

1105
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:46,140
you're serious about it it would only

1106
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,029
behoove you to find ways if you are at a

1107
00:46:48,029 --> 00:46:49,680
current if you're currently at a company

1108
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,049
that has roles or you might have the

1109
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:54,359
ability to pitch that to a director or

1110
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,720
CIO or CEO of your company of creating

1111
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,720
that role for your organization guys so

1112
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,150
find ways you know to get in that's one

1113
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,619
of my biggest regrets that I didn't get

1114
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,839
into this field sooner without realizing

1115
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,910
that I didn't have to know so much one

1116
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,369
of the you know and me in rod you know

1117
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:12,900
you can point to this as well we spoke

1118
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,700
about this briefly for a psych analyst

1119
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,200
role it does not take much guide you

1120
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,430
know having some understanding of how

1121
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,220
networks work how exploits work you know

1122
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,349
having that minor knowledge will take

1123
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:25,470
you so far in this field but it doesn't

1124
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,299
take much to get into a role like that

1125
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:28,710
if I could have done that as soon as I

1126
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,420
got out of the military I would have you

1127
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,089
know took in that sock analyst role and

1128
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,259
grew from there I would have probably

1129
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:35,819
been leaps and bounds further than where

1130
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,859
I'm at now but everything happens for a

1131
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:41,579
reason I do not you know look to my

1132
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,799
experiences in the bad way everything

1133
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:46,499
got me to where I'm at now and I'm happy

1134
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:48,089
that I am where I'm at and I want to

1135
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:50,279
help you guys do and get to the same

1136
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:52,890
place you know grind have that

1137
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,369
discipline and find ways to do if you're

1138
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:58,499
not already in IT security find ways to

1139
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:00,930
make it a part of your job be more

1140
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,660
secure and pitch that to your your

1141
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,849
leadership and the last thing I wanted

1142
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,970
to say here guys is stand out find ways

1143
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,819
to attract attention to yourself as I

1144
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,559
mentioned before it's not about what you

1145
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,869
know and it's not so much about who you

1146
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:18,299
know but it's about who knows you find a

1147
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,369
way to stand out get you a github if you

1148
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:22,529
can get you a your own personal website

1149
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:24,930
your own personal blog YouTube

1150
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,119
you know the list goes on of ways not

1151
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,619
just your LinkedIn profile in your

1152
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:30,269
resume I've seen too many guys get

1153
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:33,480
passed up guys and girls get passed up

1154
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,380
who would have been the perfect

1155
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,269
candidate for certain positions but

1156
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:38,849
because not enough people knew them and

1157
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,289
because they didn't put themselves out

1158
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:42,690
there enough they didn't get that notice

1159
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,400
you know I'm saying so definitely find

1160
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,980
ways to stand out to show value

1161
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,260
have it already set to go in your resume

1162
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,630
in and your LinkedIn and branched out -

1163
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,790
like I said github and your own personal

1164
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,670
blogs and detail what experiences you've

1165
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,589
had talk about your experiences even if

1166
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:01,349
you don't have technical things that you

1167
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:04,470
can put out into the field at least talk

1168
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,900
about it I found that you can draw a lot

1169
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,630
of value can be drawn out just of

1170
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,619
explaining and putting it out there what

1171
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,470
you have done so if anything at least do

1172
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,670
that you know

1173
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,220
vlog like I mentioned good on YouTube

1174
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,260
and you know start a channel just

1175
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,270
talking about your cybersecurity journey

1176
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,880
your info SEC journey your IT journey or

1177
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,070
your journey to get into it and have

1178
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,800
people you know drawn to that and create

1179
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,710
content around that guys so without

1180
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,829
further ado that's pretty much the end

1181
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:36,599
of it like I said I'm going to open the

1182
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,970
floor up here to any conversation you

1183
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,829
need discussions I think there was a

1184
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:42,720
question or two that I admit saw

1185
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,410
mentions from Amy before I answer that

1186
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:51,060
question I'll give rod and anyone else

1187
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,589
who might have wanted to throw something

1188
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,880
in there before I get into the questions

1189
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,819
but you know that's it guys again at the

1190
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:00,030

said I'm open to opportunities I'm open

1193
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,000
to relocation I'm definitely looking for

1194
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,310
my next opportunity I look forward to it

1195
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,609
and yeah if you have anything rod to say

1196
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,260
before I answer questions or we answer

1197
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,240
questions I'll let you go ahead and take

1198
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,790
floor

1199
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,890
well thank you very much it was an

1200
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,860
amazing talk I hardly agree with

1201
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,170
everything you said you said you

1202
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,540
couldn't have said it better you yeah I

1203
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,540
suggest people that came late we're

1204
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,450
gonna pose this so you can you can watch

1205
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,240
it again and please listen to someone do

1206
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,520
all the things that he says because he

1207
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,610
he never on the head that's what you

1208
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,600
need to do when I when I was trying to

1209
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,810
break an InfoSec he took me on three

1210
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,780
years it was not easy it was not easy

1211
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,680
I had to finance my own training because

1212
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,610
that's the I guess the irony of it you

1213
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,770
know you get all these profiles and they

1214
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,820
one of the certs

1215
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,720
that only corporations can pay and they

1216
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,580
want all this experience that all he had

1217
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,640
to jump you can have so the way I went

1218
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,880
around it yes I did what her son - said

1219
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,820
I started going to require me I play

1220
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,720
every single CD if I could I ended up

1221
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,360
winning the blackhat CDF and 2012 and

1222
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,930
that's what actually got me into the the

1223
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,090
industry I remember I was interviewing

1224
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,480
with the CEO of with the president sorry

1225
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,270
of relaxing and he he told me if you can

1226
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:40,250
win the blackhat CTF you can do the job

1227
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:45,370
here and that's how I started and when

1228
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:49,040
when I was trying to get an infrasonic I

1229
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,330
remember standing and sending resumes

1230
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,760
and I never heard for anybody and that's

1231
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,080
something that I that I want to point

1232
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,480
out here your best bet and usually their

1233
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,110
recruiting happens with who you know and

1234
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,810
HR they may not be your friends sorry to

1235
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,390
say this is usually better to meet the

1236
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:12,710
hiring manager uh is better to to have

1237
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,880
somebody introduce you

1238
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,540
so joining clubs joining associations

1239
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,010
things like di es si are the IC square

1240
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,200
your your your hackerspace meetups your

1241
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,510
college association with companies or

1242
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,680
people Indian

1243
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,030
Street this the better way to network

1244
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,440
yourself I I can tell you an example

1245
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,630
when I hired Greg Linder a great Linder

1246
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,190
was a an ex-military and

1247
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,630
what I like from him is that when I saw

1248
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,760
him playing my capture the flag he did

1249
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,360
really good

1250
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:53,210
and Greg learned to hack because he had

1251
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,740
to cut out video games in order play

1252
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,180
them cuz he couldn't afford it I hate so

1253
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,220
I thought that was amazing

1254
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,620
and I saw her on my CBS I saw him

1255
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,500
winning and I remember I told my boss at

1256
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,720
the time I said listen you please hard

1257
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,960
this guy right like I don't care you

1258
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,440
know I

1259
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,080
I'll take the blame if he fails I knew

1260
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,960
he wasn't gonna I just saw his passion

1261
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,460
and I saw how smart he was

1262
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,560
he didn't have a bachelor's degree he

1263
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,690
didn't have anything and I said I want

1264
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,750
you hard this guy he's now one of the

1265
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,550
top reverse engineers in the industry

1266
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:29,540
and and that's how a lot of people in

1267
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,490
InfoSec teams that are successful higher

1268
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,960
the higher skills not the grease I know

1269
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,700
that with the crisis you know they may

1270
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,860
get again with the stupidity you have to

1271
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,410
have an MBA in pop I listen I almost got

1272
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,350
fired for hiring a PhD and since then I

1273
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,320
learned that before I hire anybody I

1274
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,570
will have them do something technical

1275
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,100
because because you never know you get

1276
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,740
all these letters and things in you that

1277
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,720
doesn't tell me anything now if you show

1278
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,030
me a resume where you want to definitely

1279
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,390
you play or you play I don't know how to

1280
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,010
saddle you play in many places that

1281
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,170
tells me oh there is there's a one in

1282
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,300
this year to learn new things and so

1283
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,490
what didn't this year to to think

1284
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,370
outside the box and again come to the

1285
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,110
meetings meet people and and that's

1286
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,350
usually how things happened out one more

1287
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:20,330
thing before I pass it around do not

1288
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,480
fall for the trap of I had to pay all

1289
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,770
this money in order to get into the

1290
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,670
industry that's not true uh during the

1291
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,710
the Great Recession I remember and that

1292
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,860
tells obviously this is my age back then

1293
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,500
you know be and ncsc was a big deal I

1294
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,750
love some of you even know what in CSC

1295
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,150
is this is like a Microsoft Certified

1296
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,789
systems engineer

1297
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:46,489
so there was this huge scam where you

1298
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:48,859
had to basically get in dead you had to

1299
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:50,869
get a loan pay fifty thousand dollars

1300
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:52,219
and they will tell you they will

1301
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:55,249
guarantee you a job after you finished

1302
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:57,109
six eight months don't fall for that

1303
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:59,359
guys don't don't go don't fall for this

1304
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,339
schools that said oh if you pay us two

1305
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,109
thousand three thousand whatever you're

1306
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:05,089
gonna be ready to go and you're gonna

1307
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:06,769
get a job that's not true you gotta hide

1308
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:08,299
your change so getting a job go to hack

1309
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:09,920
when you're me then paying all that

1310
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,479
money that you probably don't have and

1311
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:13,430
then nobody has it be there an employee

1312
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,650
hoping that there's somebody that

1313
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,569
somehow they're gonna pay attention to

1314
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:19,160
you so please don't fall for that it's

1315
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,979
it's a scam and with that I don't know

1316
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:24,549
the NiO if you want to see something

1317
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:26,989
yeah I was gonna answer the question

1318
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:28,690
because I was posted a little while back

1319
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,910
ride from this individual named Amy I

1320
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,170
see the chat I see in the time Amy I'm

1321
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,219
not sure if you were going to unmute

1322
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:38,809
yourself but I was going to respond just

1323
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:41,229
because you asked already

1324
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:45,229
hi yeah so I see you axed can you give

1325
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:46,609
examples of our projects have worked for

1326
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,079
you I've heard of colleagues having

1327
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,210
their personal projects dismissed in

1328
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,039
interviews because they didn't encompass

1329
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:54,249
enterprise and or pride environment

1330
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:57,170
experience any advice so to be honest

1331
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,170
and rod and this gives them oh I'm not

1332
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,789
sure doing meetings or anything but um

1333
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:05,839
yeah it definitely depends it depends it

1334
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,079
depends on what opportunity you're

1335
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:10,910
looking at and what projects you're

1336
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,400
using to kind of sort of defend why

1337
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,809
you're the best candidate for that

1338
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,969
position so for instance if you work if

1339
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:18,739
you're looking to work in a sock and

1340
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:21,529
you've kind of sort of set up a similar

1341
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:23,869
environment at home and you might want

1342
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:25,759
to take note and again I'm not sure if

1343
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:27,049
this is your what you're looking to get

1344
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:30,049
into but Splunk like I mentioned earlier

1345
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,640
look into that language

1346
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,479
look into that software of the hell HCL

1347
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,509
K which I believe is a dupe and ELQ

1348
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:40,489
stack a lot of you guys might know that

1349
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,239
is looking to that but basically try to

1350
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,039
find if you're going to use a project

1351
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,109
for any opportunity you're looking into

1352
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,460
obviously you want to make you want to

1353
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,759
fine-tune that project for that

1354
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:54,829
opportunity for sake analysts it'll be

1355
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:56,300
certain projects for

1356
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,730
or if you're looking to get into

1357
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,440
application security what laughs have

1358
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,990
you worked on what databases have you

1359
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,330
secured you know um so make sure the

1360
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,690
project so again it really depends on

1361
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,430
what projects you're using to defend

1362
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,850
your your value but I would say start

1363
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:14,390
there

1364
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,910
you know just open yourself up again for

1365
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,410
me personally and I don't want to

1366
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,920
tangent too far but me personally um it

1367
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,570
took a while for me to know what I

1368
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,550
wanted to do in IT security I'm still

1369
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:29,210
figuring it out as I go along but try to

1370
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,310
find that so that way you can work on

1371
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,590
things that have value to that field

1372
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,270
again if you're looking to get into red

1373
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:40,100
teaming blue teaming sock analysts pen

1374
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,100
testing web applications security find

1375
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,870
projects that have to do with those

1376
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,270
things and then use those projects

1377
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,430
because I've I've honestly I have not

1378
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,890
heard personally a me of individuals

1379
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,270
getting that project especially if the

1380
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,520
hiring manager and let me say this - I'm

1381
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,590
sure rod can attest to this as well if

1382
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,360
the hiring manager is that does not have

1383
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,100
an IT security background I wouldn't I

1384
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,780
could care if they dismiss my project I

1385
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,520
care less like that's on them because

1386
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,990
they don't understand enough about what

1387
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,910
we do anyways they're looking for other

1388
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:11,060
things but if that person at individual

1389
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,280
does then they will appreciate it that

1390
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,830
much more so make sure you're aware of

1391
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,900
what perspective so to speak that

1392
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,860
they're coming from hope that makes

1393
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,370
sense am i right I find that a little

1394
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:26,420
odd because if you if you are a person

1395
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,010
that you were able to download Splunk

1396
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:32,330
for example and you were able to to

1397
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,450
learn how to ingest sources to look for

1398
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,720
for learning analytics in traffic for

1399
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,580
example or see logs from from Apache or

1400
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,310
from windows even though it's not at the

1401
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,070
enterprise level it's very valuable and

1402
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:52,010
in my opinion it will put your boss or

1403
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:54,530
somebody had that hasn't that it hasn't

1404
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,080
done that at all so don't be discouraged

1405
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,450
by that just try to make sure however

1406
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,520
though this is usually one of the things

1407
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,850
that I tell people you had to I know at

1408
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,560
first it's hard because you really don't

1409
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,420
know what your forte is and you know

1410
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,099
what really you're gonna like so

1411
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:12,979
people like to be behind racks with

1412
00:59:12,979 --> 00:59:15,109
hoodies and air conditioner and they

1413
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:17,749
never talked to anybody and that's their

1414
00:59:17,749 --> 00:59:19,609
passion right so these are people that

1415
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:21,499
are you know ki were rats there are

1416
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:23,450
they're typing commands all night and

1417
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,059
it's all about firewall Sudeste cups for

1418
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:28,910
example I hate seconds like if you if

1419
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,009
you put me to configure fire zone say

1420
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:32,630
hey I know what to do but I don't want

1421
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,910
this for living some other people are

1422
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,009
passionate about pen testing for example

1423
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:40,339
they love to break into a web app some

1424
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:41,660
others are in binaries

1425
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,549
you there's one thing about InfoSec you

1426
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:45,229
need to know and that's one of the

1427
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:46,999
things that I put on my CD f's you can

1428
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:49,309
know everything you cannot know

1429
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:51,079
everything at one point you're gonna

1430
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:53,809
have to choose something and specialize

1431
00:59:53,809 --> 00:59:56,239
on it you you may want to know I think

1432
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,400
here and there you're not gonna be and

1433
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,989
this is usually one of the things that I

1434
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:02,960
see when they're hiring they won they

1435
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,509
won ten years of reversing ten years a

1436
01:00:05,509 --> 01:00:07,160
web app I thought I thought some

1437
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,660
reporters decide like for careers

1438
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,789
together this is impossible so don't

1439
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:13,489
fall for that I try to do prepare

1440
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:16,579
yourself the best you can and do your

1441
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,729
effort don't be discouraged so do you

1442
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,069
guys mind if I add something because you

1443
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:24,140
guys know that I'm not actually in the

1444
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,559
cybersecurity industry but I I have my

1445
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:29,509
own company so I'd like to give you a

1446
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:32,180
perspective from a company owner or a

1447
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,950
hiring person so some of it may not be

1448
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:40,039
as the feedback may not be as accurate

1449
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:41,989
as you should think so if somebody goes

1450
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:43,279
on an interview and they come back and

1451
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:44,809
they tell you oh my god they just missed

1452
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,299
my personal project that may not be why

1453
01:00:47,299 --> 01:00:49,369
it was dismissed it may be that they

1454
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:51,170
just had a bad interview and they

1455
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,269
thought that was the reason they didn't

1456
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:55,009
get it so take all of that with a grain

1457
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:56,960
of salt because when you are

1458
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,719
interviewing and hiring people you're

1459
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:01,549
looking at the soft skills as well right

1460
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:03,710
so you can be the most brilliant person

1461
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,809
on the planet you can be the best pen

1462
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:08,390
tester on the planet but if I don't

1463
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,670
think you're gonna meld with my team

1464
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,039
you're not getting the job right so

1465
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:15,140
y'all need to also I'm sorry I'm getting

1466
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,969
on my soapbox now y'all need to also

1467
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,859
work on your soft skills work on your

1468
01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:21,319
interpersonal skills because I know it

1469
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:23,040
sucks because I came up

1470
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,480
the ranks I had all the certifications

1471
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,510
your MCS the you talked about the NCSE I

1472
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,790
did all that study on my own took the

1473
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,920
test on my own so out-of-pocket was just

1474
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,770
the testing fees but yeah it took me six

1475
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,630
months to get all of those other things

1476
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,390
like what eight certifications oh my god

1477
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,240
it was you know $15,000 for the class

1478
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,920
and I didn't have that as a single mom

1479
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,690
so I did it all on my own

1480
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,670
but I wasn't getting the jobs then it

1481
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,010
was because I didn't have the

1482
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,870
interpersonal skills I had all the

1483
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,090
certifications I knew how to do you know

1484
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,620
network architect like you wouldn't

1485
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,980
believe but I was not a nice person to

1486
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,520
be around

1487
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,260
at the time a little nice from now

1488
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,810
obviously you guys that know me but yeah

1489
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,790
work on your personal skills that is I'm

1490
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,800
gonna tell you from my perspective

1491
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,650
that's more than 50% of getting the job

1492
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,600
it's great that you know you are

1493
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,300
business master your skills but if you

1494
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,070
don't have interpersonal skills I don't

1495
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,510
want you in my office I don't want you

1496
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,130
on my team because you're just gonna be

1497
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,190
a cowboy badass narcissist that thinks

1498
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,530
that the world can't run without you and

1499
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,060
that's not the truth because I can find

1500
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,970
10 others with your same experience that

1501
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:33,260
can actually get along with other people

1502
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:38,760
brilliant jerks box now so Amy that may

1503
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,080
not be the reason they didn't get that

1504
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,160
job yeah I wasn't I wanted I wanted to

1505
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,200
piggyback on that real quick soft skills

1506
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,970
oh my goodness they're everything I feel

1507
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,040
like I noticed thought could have

1508
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,470
finally got even longer if we were to

1509
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,000
deep dive some of those some of the

1510
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,700
topics I presented but soft skills I've

1511
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,370
found and this is to Amy and anyone else

1512
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,360
on this talk right now

1513
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,880
the majority of physicians I mean

1514
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,650
honestly I'll say all the positions I've

1515
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,930
ever had my soft skills probably

1516
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,060
mattered just a little bit a lot more a

1517
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,990
lot more my technical because you and

1518
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,880
this is even coming from a military my

1519
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,640
background in military morale is

1520
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,170
everything like you can put his

1521
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,280
production down so far if you are

1522
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,400
negative if you're not producing a

1523
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,690
positive helping to produce a positive

1524
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,720
in bar environment so you know that will

1525
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,490
definitely take you far in this field as

1526
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,040
well I can't remember the saying but I

1527
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,420
know you can anymore

1528
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,400
you just about can be trained and just

1529
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,950
about anything but you can't train a

1530
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,990
good attitude you can't you know you

1531
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,270
can't teach that you know I'm saying so

1532
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:47,610
that is part of that internal what's the

1533
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:51,090
part of you that you need to work on and

1534
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,040
I'm not saying to sit here and you know

1535
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,840
kiss butt or anything like that don't be

1536
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,380
fake about it he will be real genuine

1537
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,490
about wanting to be a part of a positive

1538
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:05,160
environment and adding positivity to it

1539
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,050
soft skills are so important and I

1540
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,900
wanted to mention rod you talked about

1541
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,070
something I was going to just say this

1542
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,470
real quick stand when it comes to this

1543
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:16,410
market now that we're in it is it is

1544
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,000
what it is but it is definitely an

1545
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,250
employer's market right now you know so

1546
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,050
many people have been laid off I mean if

1547
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,400
you're a local to South Florida you

1548
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,830
heard about what does that company name

1549
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:30,000
the three AAA are a var var company did

1550
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,610
you eat much but basically that's the

1551
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,590
one so this thing about a company like

1552
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:37,080
that dropping so many uniquely skilled

1553
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,930
people this is at this point in time is

1554
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,490
definitely in a lot of companies done

1555
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,690
the same thing this is an employer's

1556
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:46,080
marketplace so definitely again stand

1557
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,320
out find ways do projects and I don't

1558
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,520
know if you guys saw rod or miss gizmo

1559
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,260
saw the other comment I saw something

1560
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,810
about what platform would you recommend

1561
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,820
from Alex and again guys you can unmute

1562
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:03,210
yourselves and yeah yeah ask the

1563
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,240
question for all of us to hear but I

1564
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,430
just was going to hit on it real quickly

1565
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,830
here you said what platform Alex chess

1566
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,840
what platform would you recommend to

1567
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,180
start a personal blog to put personal

1568
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,570
projects manuals it really again that's

1569
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,360
one of those it depends I've I haven't

1570
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:25,140
seen a bad response come from using

1571
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,640
something like WordPress for your own

1572
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,790
personal blog and github for your own

1573
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,550
personal projects I'm not a programming

1574
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,530
guy at all by any means you know I'm not

1575
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,250
I need to learn more get my Python

1576
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,610
skills and Linux skills when it comes to

1577
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:45,150
that that that language but I've seen a

1578
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,890
lot of individuals have success with

1579
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,720
that I've even come across the actual

1580
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,220
individual I mean who

1581
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,410
who I was giving an example of when it

1582
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:55,230
comes to drive he interviewed where they

1583
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,420
actually wanted to look at his get like

1584
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,480
they were that serious about those that

1585
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,420
that skillset so use that platform to

1586
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,160
help get your projects out there and

1587
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,560
again like I mentioned a wordpress and

1588
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,780
you guys ride or miss gizmo you can

1589
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,000
definitely you know throw in chime in or

1590
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,900
Natalie Mike I think I I think sometimes

1591
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,359
these things go by I like fat you know

1592
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:22,040
like blogger would bake at one point

1593
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,280
right now I can tell you there even if

1594
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,650
you put like papers or projects and

1595
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,290
github it's almost like they they look

1596
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,970
for it they will ask you a what's your

1597
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:36,150
github so I think obvious one and and

1598
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,800
medium for some reason people are doing

1599
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,800
median now nowadays I love medium not

1600
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,390
for some reason for us because they've

1601
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,830
agreed that I love it they charged oh

1602
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:50,040
they do yeah yeah not I'm not in the

1603
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,290
charge thing you can host a hot by the

1604
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,990
way you can cause a blog and github you

1605
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:00,359
have to go tit but you can't and it

1606
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:02,280
looks pretty cool then Dow and that will

1607
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,810
impress me if you if you come with a

1608
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,940
resume that's posted on the blog and

1609
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,270
github that's true yeah I see another

1610
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,160
question real quickly I was going to hit

1611
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,560
on from Alex his second two-part

1612
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,800
question bug bounties versus CTS work

1613
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,910
and I where I can better put my effort

1614
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,290
for that kind of question I mean those

1615
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,480
are two different worlds almost I mean

1616
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,570
you can get better at bug bounties by

1617
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,720
doing CTFs and vice versa I mean you

1618
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,609
really when it comes to bug bounties you

1619
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:34,440
know that's where you make money helping

1620
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,820
you know for those who are on this call

1621
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,859
or on this talk who don't know bug

1622
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:41,280
bounty and this is just a real dirty way

1623
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,330
of explaining it but it's basically

1624
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:44,700
where you help companies better protect

1625
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,349
themselves and make money for you know

1626
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:48,660
different companies Microsoft Google's

1627
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,540
and and smaller companies will put out

1628
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,089
challenges for people and put a price on

1629
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:59,099
it for fixing that bug arm as far as

1630
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:01,800
your bet your efforts I honestly would

1631
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,050
say both you know like if you have

1632
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:07,140
depending on your availability work on

1633
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,140
both CTFs I personally like CTS because

1634
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,630
of the collaboration because of the

1635
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,270
environment that it puts me in around a

1636
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:16,680
lot of other people especially obviously

1637
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,029
when we meet in person online is

1638
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:20,729
different but such as the South Florida

1639
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:25,260
is a packed the flag that we've had at

1640
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:28,260
FIU for the past few years those types

1641
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,000
of environments I love being around

1642
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,490
others who are doing this challenge and

1643
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:34,380
and learning and growing and networking

1644
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,240
you know any environment you could put

1645
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,069
yourself in to get around others who are

1646
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:38,850
in the field

1647
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,399
go for it but bow knees are a little bit

1648
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,640
more exclusive where it's mainly you and

1649
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,770
your computer and you might reach out to

1650
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,210
a few people here and there to get help

1651
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,220
but that's really like something that

1652
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,109
you're doing for yourself so I would

1653
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:54,569
probably say like I said do both and it

1654
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:55,799
really depends on where you're trying to

1655
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,779
go and what you're trying to do but CTFs

1656
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:59,490
I would definitely if you can do an

1657
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,470
in-person CTF or a CTF where a lot of

1658
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,899
people want to be involved at that time

1659
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:05,960
I would definitely heart them on that

1660
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,010
but you can't go wrong with either one

1661
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,810
I'm gonna mute myself for this one oh

1662
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:17,970
sorry oh no go you you know go ahead Amy

1663
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,979
I was just saying well said I was just

1664
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:21,120
getting right behind him

1665
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,760
go ahead oh okay I was just gonna ask

1666
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,580
for some advice maybe culling through

1667
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,029
all of I guess the myriad of fields um I

1668
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:34,380
mean I get try things right go to CTF

1669
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,140
just went to my first recently pretty

1670
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:43,680
well um so but beyond that like is there

1671
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,620
anything else you can think of that's

1672
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,390
maybe less traditional advice I don't

1673
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,370
know

1674
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,430
you

1675
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:58,750
um a less traditional advice as rod said

1676
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,750
in my experience you know joining the

1677
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,140
hack Miami group I know that a lot of

1678
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,640
people that join they'll come in they're

1679
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,580
nervous and they're very shy they won't

1680
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,140
speak during their first meeting or two

1681
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,240
meetings or whatever but then I always

1682
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,100
like try to get some feedback what did

1683
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,690
you think or whatever and most of the

1684
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:20,050
time they just like completely go you

1685
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,610
know they're like these are my people I

1686
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,230
finally found my people they finally

1687
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,240
found their tribe where they fit in and

1688
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:29,140
as rod said you spend a year a year and

1689
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,150
a half two years in the hack Miami group

1690
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,490
with the presentations that we give the

1691
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,830
education that we give and I also have

1692
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:39,190
to promote the Issa because I'm on the

1693
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:41,590
board of that as well but the education

1694
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,900
that you get there knowing the people

1695
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,480
and knowing who's there and then getting

1696
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,850
the industry information of who's hiring

1697
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,070
and what skills you know a couple weeks

1698
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,260
ago month or so ago we had a thing on

1699
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,420
Splunk so I know Stevens asking about

1700
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,250
Splunk right he's saying oh because he

1701
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,690
didn't have luck maybe I read it

1702
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:01,240
incorrectly I'm perusing you know but

1703
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,550
you get those things so you know we have

1704
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,440
sessions on Splunk we have sessions on

1705
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,330
the higher end things you know Rob does

1706
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,670
you know the basic pentesting 101 he

1707
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,110
doesn't ministry

1708
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:13,510
you get all of that when you join these

1709
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,910
meetings and get this education and then

1710
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,860
just person after person is like oh I

1711
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:18,940
got a job at Akamai

1712
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,070
I got a job in this song I got a job as

1713
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:24,610
you know a security analyst here and you

1714
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:28,210
you can't deny that much success but the

1715
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:29,770
personal skills the interpersonal soft

1716
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:32,740
skills I'm all about that so yeah I was

1717
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:37,780
just gonna say that was such a good plug

1718
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:46,330
for your own for this club oh right you

1719
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,220
were saying something I'm sorry yeah the

1720
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,800
person Steve is Stephen they're saying

1721
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,850
that is hard it is hard it's not easy it

1722
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,940
is not easy and I see you you put a lot

1723
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,550
of effort my question to you is do you

1724
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,890
wanna stay in Florida because some of

1725
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,390
the things that you put in there is

1726
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,310
gonna be very hard to find somebody here

1727
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:08,440
for you may have to relocate

1728
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,739
you look to me like like you will be

1729
01:12:11,739 --> 01:12:15,219
great at AWS or the Facebook or at

1730
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:18,370
Google we have people AWS I can I can

1731
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,010
introduce you to them and but you don't

1732
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,300
have to move they don't they don't but

1733
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:27,250
you have to work together so you have to

1734
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:32,130
consider that it's very hard in Florida

1735
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,100
the industries there is more I always

1736
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,100
tell you guys the the the hot Miami is a

1737
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,070
big team of his own success once you get

1738
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,219
into this industry you leave you may

1739
01:12:45,219 --> 01:12:47,050
maybe you stay your first or second year

1740
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:49,780
but once we start getting senior there's

1741
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,310
not much of industry here

1742
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:54,040
some people were gets to work remote and

1743
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,320
come back but some others for the most

1744
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,210
part I promise you you you're gonna have

1745
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:02,830
to relocate so consider that consider

1746
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,080
opening your your horizons because it's

1747
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,080
not easy it's not easy it's so there is

1748
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,850
more and I even worse with all the

1749
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,219
layoffs that company that we just

1750
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:13,239
mentioned that was one of the peace

1751
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:15,760
companies here other than that you have

1752
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,190
Citrix and there are a few others but

1753
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,190
there's there's so much here

1754
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:23,830
well according to sir Kirby's interview

1755
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,370
on CNBC last week whenever it was

1756
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:31,080
apparently he invented work from home

1757
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:39,100
we're all about the work from home it's

1758
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,409
expanded our industry and now we can get

1759
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:43,120
individuals all over and all this

1760
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,340
different talents and I'm like oh dear

1761
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,719
god you're killing me right now

1762
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,489
I've been working from home for 20 years

1763
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:52,050
I think they're gonna go half of them

1764
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,820
like half of the workforce is gonna be

1765
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:58,570
removed then yes you start building the

1766
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:01,000
buildings around Facebook because I go

1767
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,909
there where I used to and keep building

1768
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,770
they have their own hotel they have

1769
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,170
everything around them so I doesn't look

1770
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,360
like that they're gonna go work for home

1771
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,219
yeah I was going to mention too with

1772
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:18,090
that question that Steve Steven I've

1773
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:20,560
I've seen that quite a bit you know you

1774
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,179
have all the qualifications

1775
01:14:22,179 --> 01:14:24,760
should be nothing for you to get into a

1776
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,820
good position but my two cents your

1777
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,499
network like I mentioned a few slides

1778
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,420
back is everything like I've literally

1779
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,479
gotten positions almost strictly based

1780
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,170
off of who knew me off of my network off

1781
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,729
of knowing the right people at the right

1782
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:42,340
time and I'm not someone who has even

1783
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:44,050
half of what you have to be completely

1784
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:45,880
Frank with you but I was fortunate

1785
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,519
enough to be in a position where because

1786
01:14:48,519 --> 01:14:50,619
someone saw the passion that I had and

1787
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:51,999
knew that I wanted to stick and stay in

1788
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:53,979
this field I was recommended for the

1789
01:14:53,979 --> 01:14:55,780
position like I would literally one of

1790
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,030
the best positions I had and I'm kind of

1791
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,909
sad that I'm not still there because it

1792
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:02,170
was an amazing opportunity but one of

1793
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:05,320
the cofounders actually of SF is a South

1794
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,989
Florida who's a CIO now actually

1795
01:15:07,989 --> 01:15:09,429
interviewed me and I got a position

1796
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:12,309
because of someone in his network again

1797
01:15:12,309 --> 01:15:14,439
that knew me and he saw that we had a

1798
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:16,749
connection on LinkedIn so that would be

1799
01:15:16,749 --> 01:15:19,179
outside of yet your own self education

1800
01:15:19,179 --> 01:15:20,860
outside of the certifications and

1801
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,769
degrees you have bro

1802
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,530
tap into your network like hack Miami to

1803
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,030
me was like a blessing in disguise it

1804
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:28,809
was actually something that was

1805
01:15:28,809 --> 01:15:31,630
introduced to me going to Nova one of

1806
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,920
the individuals that I went to school

1807
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:37,030
with knew about hack Miami and invited

1808
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,070
me out to a meeting and from there is

1809
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,269
this thing it's been curtains you know

1810
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,829
I've been able to network with the right

1811
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:44,829
people get to kind of get more clear

1812
01:15:44,829 --> 01:15:46,900
vision or worn out what I wanted to do

1813
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,689
in the field where I wanted to go but

1814
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:51,249
again rod is right you know you

1815
01:15:51,249 --> 01:15:53,229
definitely if you're not getting remote

1816
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:55,420
opportunities coming to you you probably

1817
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,429
gonna have to look to move expand your

1818
01:15:57,429 --> 01:16:00,869
horizons open yourself up to relocation

1819
01:16:00,869 --> 01:16:03,639
but definitely your network is so

1820
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:05,409
valuable man I'm and I might be

1821
01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:06,579
preaching to the choir you may already

1822
01:16:06,579 --> 01:16:09,010
know this but again this market right

1823
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,959
right now is not the easiest to move

1824
01:16:10,959 --> 01:16:14,739
around in but definitely reach out one

1825
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:17,260
of the keys I'll mention when it comes

1826
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,479
to networking yo is uh if you see a

1827
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:21,039
company and this is like a little hack

1828
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,409
so to speak if you see a company that

1829
01:16:23,409 --> 01:16:26,019
you want to work for on LinkedIn you see

1830
01:16:26,019 --> 01:16:27,959
individuals who work for that company

1831
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:30,189
pull their ear a little bit you know

1832
01:16:30,189 --> 01:16:32,679
like put a drop a little information in

1833
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:35,680
their ear like hey sir ma'am or whatever

1834
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,570
name is you know I see you work here I'm

1835
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,430
very interested in the positions you

1836
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,920
guys currently have or may have in the

1837
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,720
future you know like I mentioned before

1838
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,120
give value find ways if they're working

1839
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,740
on a project if they got something going

1840
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,510
on find ways to give value if you can

1841
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,120
but if not at that time you can't find

1842
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,310
ways to give value pull their ear a

1843
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,960
little bit like see look them up only

1844
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,000
LinkedIn is amazing for this you can see

1845
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,550
someone who works for Microsoft you can

1846
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,050
see someone who works for Google or

1847
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,720
Amazon reached out to them like type in

1848
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,570
security on Amazon in LinkedIn and it'll

1849
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:09,790
show you security engineers architects

1850
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,400
so forth and so on reach out to them and

1851
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,500
it doesn't hurt to try you know just get

1852
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,810
again it's about who knows you who's

1853
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:18,430
getting eyes because what it sounds like

1854
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,500
to me Stephen what out for what I'm

1855
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,600
seeing is it's that you don't have

1856
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,250
enough eyes yet again the market

1857
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,990
whatever's happening is happening but

1858
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:27,610
you don't seem to have enough eyes on

1859
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,260
you because it shouldn't really like

1860
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,640
with that amount of experience and

1861
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,200
certifications and stuff like that man

1862
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,330
it really shouldn't be hard to get your

1863
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:37,420
first opportunity in security but try

1864
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,530
that out you know I would definitely

1865
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,530
suggest trying that out only then go to

1866
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,330
a company that you want to work for fire

1867
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:47,920
I even whatever company is and and try

1868
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,500
to reach out to one of their there even

1869
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,870
the director CIO you know CEO doesn't

1870
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,940
hurt you know and and let them know that

1871
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,070
you're very interested and that's

1872
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,240
another part of the whole setting

1873
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,010
yourself apart standing out that I

1874
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:02,080
mentioned earlier on and I'm seeing

1875
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,210
questions you guys again flub please

1876
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:07,090
don't hesitate I'm gonna meet myself now

1877
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,680
but please don't hesitate to unmute

1878
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,510
yourself and ask I'm gonna start

1879
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:11,950
scrolling through right now but that's

1880
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:16,960
my take on this okay any ask your

1881
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,150
question go ahead yeah yeah okay so I

1882
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:22,990
just got an offer not sorry I just got a

1883
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:26,740
recommendation for from a professor for

1884
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:31,020
an AWS internship and I guess I was just

1885
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,690
wondering should I somehow get an offer

1886
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:40,240
some miracle happens what should I do to

1887
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,700
I mean I don't know how can I best

1888
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,380
advance my career from that point having

1889
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,630
it mind you just starting

1890
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:53,170
right that's wrong all the way the the

1891
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:57,250
best way to leverage and that is if

1892
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,940
you're gonna rate WS and this is I guess

1893
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:04,300
the the technical bar is they take their

1894
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,790
free trainings so that way will help you

1895
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:10,180
when you go in you you you're not

1896
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,820
starting from scratch so things like

1897
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,270
that may help you they definitely have

1898
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,670
there's plenty of free training from

1899
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,610
them so I will take it and prepare

1900
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,750
myself for it

1901
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,480
same things they think such as if you're

1902
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:29,470
doing security or was tomten if you're

1903
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:32,440
doing networking tcp/ip tcp/ip everybody

1904
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,260
wants no tcp/ip you have to learn this

1905
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,150
is a classic question can I ask you what

1906
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,770
the OSI lay your side the same way an

1907
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,680
OSI layer so it's usually a a classic

1908
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,300
question and then Linux Linux is

1909
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,700
important or Linux I don't care what my

1910
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,010
to success you've had to learn Linux

1911
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:54,850
learn Linux force yourself to learn

1912
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:58,420
Linux do get yourself a Linux computer

1913
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:03,430
use it every day already they're awesome

1914
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,920
then then then then this is gonna be

1915
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,210
great for you because if you have to do

1916
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,490
a lot like a terminal work you already

1917
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:13,900
know what to do yeah okay I guess like

1918
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,280
my question was more toward like how

1919
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,850
okay how would I I don't know I guess if

1920
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,130
they's higher internally like that might

1921
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,080
be something that that you know about

1922
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,340
right how would I go about being a more

1923
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,120
attractive candidate I don't know man

1924
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,160
yeah question that is a perfect way to I

1925
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,630
can tell you one well we weren't Akamai

1926
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:45,880
for example or it's Blanc you don't

1927
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:52,239
choose lightly intercept usually eight

1928
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,880
chips are seen as a way to to hire

1929
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,400
somebody that has a lot of potential and

1930
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,499
will not cost us thousands of dollars by

1931
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:03,460
a recruiter or will have to have around

1932
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,889
recruiters you know scavenging and

1933
01:21:05,889 --> 01:21:08,050
looking for people so internships are a

1934
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:10,269
way to acquire talent

1935
01:21:10,269 --> 01:21:13,809
do your best do your best but again you

1936
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:17,260
know I says it's something that is very

1937
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,789
important your intelligence your your

1938
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:25,809
personal relationships in sometimes and

1939
01:21:25,809 --> 01:21:27,550
this is something you see in your career

1940
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,289
it's not your fault

1941
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:31,900

01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,780
because I'm trying to scroll back

2004
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,300
through the chat I think I mentioned or

2005
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,889
you mentioned something about you know

2006
01:24:12,889 --> 01:24:14,869
what do you do about those job postings

2007
01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:16,780
acts for so many years of experience

2008
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:19,489
guys if you are looking at the slide

2009
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:22,280
show right now the second resource that

2010
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,900
I put there some of you might be

2011
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,520
familiar with this gentleman his name is

2012
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,360
the the cyber mentor or he also founded

2013
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,510
a company called vet sec in that video

2014
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,610
in particular he kind of gives details

2015
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:36,949
into his journey Amy and this is very

2016
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:39,679
specific if you go to the five minute

2017
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,210
mark in that video he actually talks

2018
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,250
exactly about that when you see job

2019
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,960
descriptions I've learned this it took

2020
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,850
so long because there's so many

2021
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,830
opportunities that I passed up by simply

2022
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,719
not applying the worst thing the worst

2023
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,580
thing that any of these jobs can tell

2024
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:55,369
you is no but it doesn't hurt to try you

2025
01:24:55,369 --> 01:24:57,650
know apply God as if they're asking for

2026
01:24:57,650 --> 01:24:59,929
they're looking for unicorns the most

2027
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,510
hiring managers and start to say a lot

2028
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:05,449
of a lot of HR managers or HR recruiters

2029
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:06,830
they don't they don't know what they're

2030
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:08,750
looking for they'll just put so many

2031
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:11,480
requirements so many like I got ten page

2032
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,590
Job Description apply if you feel that

2033
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:17,179
and this is more to Raj point you know

2034
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:18,619
obviously don't apply for something you

2035
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:19,370
have

2036
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,290
so no idea what it is that you're doing

2037
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:24,440
with that but if you feel that you can

2038
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,530
if even if you don't a hundred percent

2039
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,730
satisfy the job requirements try to

2040
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,260
apply anyways like I said I passed over

2041
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,600
a lot of opportunities in that video

2042
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,760
like I said it's the second point bullet

2043
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,950
point there that talks about he

2044
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:38,570
literally said how he got his first

2045
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:42,350
opportunity in InfoSec only by applying

2046
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,780
for a job even though it required a lot

2047
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:47,870
a little bit more I think about he

2048
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:50,150
probably had like 50% and I'm not saying

2049
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,800
this is across the board by any means

2050
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,600
but again the worst thing that could

2051
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,760
happen is for them to say no but he's

2052
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,590
specifically at the five minute mark of

2053
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,990
that video he talks about how he got

2054
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:02,780
over that objection of he doesn't have

2055
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,040
the experience he doesn't have the

2056
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,810
background he doesn't have the degree he

2057
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:07,070
doesn't have the surgery does all that

2058
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,770
stuff they're looking for unicorns but

2059
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,110
if you have that passion I Drive if

2060
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:13,640
you're willing to put in the work the

2061
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,800
OJT like I mentioned a few slides back

2062
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,260
that will take you so far and that

2063
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:20,390
gentleman is one of the few guys that I

2064
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,640
follow on YouTube in the IT security

2065
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,460
space he now has his own pin testing

2066
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,190
company where you know within the last

2067
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:30,740
decade he went from a total newb to now

2068
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,470
having his own company where he's making

2069
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:35,570
like you know no key and this is not a

2070
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:38,420
standard by any means but it's his story

2071
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,400
he's making over a hundred thousand per

2072
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,130
month now doing not just pin testing but

2073
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:45,350
within his own company but it all

2074
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,330
started with putting himself out there

2075
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,250
learning growing getting the

2076
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,020
certifications and establishing his

2077
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,810
network so I would definitely recommend

2078
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:56,180
paying special attention to that video

2079
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,590
just as a little bit more of a

2080
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:59,480
motivation for when you see stuff like

2081
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,700
that because it definitely can make you

2082
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,780
feel like man I don't have that

2083
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,190
experience I'm gonna have that knowledge

2084
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,780
and I don't I don't even want to apply

2085
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,890
because I don't want to waste their time

2086
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,080
doesn't matter go to that video and

2087
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,340
you'll see exactly what I'm talking

2088
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:12,830
about I do also want to add I hate to be

2089
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:14,720
that cheesy bumper sticker kind of girl

2090
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,820
but y'all y'all that know me I am that

2091
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,380
cheesy bumper sticker kind of girl you

2092
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:21,950
miss 100% of the shots you don't take

2093

fill out your resume don't just send in

2094

a regular CV create your CV according to

2095
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:31,460
that job post that is a huge miss if you

2096
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,239
just create

2097
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,610
TV and just blast it out you're missing

2098
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:36,559
a lot of opportunities take five minutes

2099
01:27:36,559 --> 01:27:39,170
to tailor your CV to that job posting

2100

2101
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,999
there and if you don't have single mom

2102
01:27:43,999 --> 01:27:46,599
right I did not get my bachelor's degree

2103
01:27:46,599 --> 01:27:49,130
you know I worked at it worked at it

2104
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,630
worked at it but as a single mom it just

2105
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:52,280
never happened I just couldn't finish it

2106
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,440
that I got all my Microsoft

2107
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,599
certifications I've got I probably have

2108
01:27:56,599 --> 01:27:58,789
75 different certifications and I have

2109
01:27:58,789 --> 01:28:01,849
on-the-job training and I am a little

2110
01:28:01,849 --> 01:28:04,880
dog I don't stop I never quit and that's

2111
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,530
what employers look for it's not

2112
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:09,320
necessarily I I landed many jobs that

2113
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,119
said you must have a bachelor's degree

2114
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,070
you must have any master's degree I

2115
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,469
walked right in there and I'm like this

2116
01:28:15,469 --> 01:28:17,349
is my experience this is what I've done

2117
01:28:17,349 --> 01:28:19,760
and again how much of a team player

2118
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,340
at the time I'm much better now but yeah

2119
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,110
you don't know they have to put those

2120
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:26,389
there to have a barrier of some sort but

2121
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:30,199
as song said their HR they don't know

2122
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:31,699
what they're looking for they're just

2123
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:33,559
doing the job posting you're probably

2124
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:35,269
not going to enter you're only going to

2125
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:36,860
they're gonna be the gatekeeper for the

2126
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,170
first interview after that you're going

2127
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,340
to get the people that are going to ask

2128
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:42,019
you the real questions about your real

2129
01:28:42,019 --> 01:28:47,559
experience so that's my take on it rod

2130
01:28:47,559 --> 01:28:50,929
Claire green let's don't be discouraged

2131
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:53,599
and try again

2132
01:28:53,599 --> 01:28:56,749
and I went I wasted I think I wasted I

2133
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:59,480
want to tie myself looking into this job

2134
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,400
sites where I was being denied by HR HR

2135
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,289
is looking for all these keywords right

2136
01:29:06,289 --> 01:29:09,530
the way to go around that is to join

2137
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:12,469
associations network network as much as

2138
01:29:12,469 --> 01:29:18,559
you can even Twitter even LinkedIn where

2139
01:29:18,559 --> 01:29:20,570
you can you know don't be shy reach out

2140
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:22,909
oh yeah I get all the time ping by

2141
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:24,710
people they say hey can you give me a

2142
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:27,019
recommendation for this job and

2143
01:29:27,019 --> 01:29:29,179
sometimes I'm like well do I know you or

2144
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:32,719
let me see you let me see what your your

2145
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,849
experience is do you look like you know

2146
01:29:34,849 --> 01:29:37,219
you might fit yeah I'll give you a

2147
01:29:37,219 --> 01:29:39,019
recommendation not a problem but you

2148
01:29:39,019 --> 01:29:41,929
have to try again and obviously when you

2149
01:29:41,929 --> 01:29:45,670
see using my impression when I

2150
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,860
when I see those profiles is that they

2151
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,720
don't know what they're looking for and

2152
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,060
when you talk to the hiring manager the

2153
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,250
story is completely different the hiring

2154
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,350
manager would tell you or know you know

2155
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,060
you can know a little bit of this but I

2156
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,030
want this right and maybe that is what

2157
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:04,930
you have so usually that's the key the

2158
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:07,180
key is to find who's the hiring manager

2159
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:11,110
the HR you know the I seed 100% of the

2160
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,450
time the hiring manager telling HR I

2161
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,740
want this person I don't care what you

2162
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,520
say that's it so I will tell you one of

2163
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,160
the things I did I landed a pretty nice

2164
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,330
contract I went after a particular

2165
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:29,740
company as a whale and I found the owner

2166
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:31,390
of the company on the LinkedIn and then

2167
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:32,890
I found him on Meetup

2168
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:35,560
this is total social engineering guys I

2169
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,330
found him on Meetup and I found a

2170
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:39,760
particular group that he was in and I

2171
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,400
put myself in that wine tasting dinner

2172
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,280
that he was going to be in and I made

2173
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,590
sure I got seated next to him and two

2174
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:52,140
months later I had a nice juicy project

2175
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,280
god that's awesome stalk them use the

2176
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,880
skills you have

2177
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,780
and one of the things that landed that

2178
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:05,630
prospect was a concert that's what we

2179
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:10,640
bonded over Axl Rose we bonded over Axl

2180
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,690
Rose if you can believe it

2181
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,050
you know I was just going to throw in

2182
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,719
- since like you said miss gizmo as far

2183
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,699
as the gatekeepers guys um the the

2184
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:28,429
degrees are nice the certs are amazing

2185
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:31,070
the way I always put it in a pecking

2186
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:33,409
order experience over everything like

2187
01:31:33,409 --> 01:31:35,300
what you've done is more important in

2188
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,550
any of those pieces of paper but the

2189
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,110
thing is you have to get through the

2190
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:42,020
gatekeepers but if you have that Network

2191
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:44,270
the gatekeepers won't matter so kind of

2192
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:45,770
take what I'm saying with a grain of

2193
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:48,050
salt but balance it like so yeah you

2194
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,849
have the gatekeepers you know the

2195
01:31:49,849 --> 01:31:51,679
bachelors degree D the the

2196
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,079
certifications to get through them is

2197
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:56,599
one thing but again if you build those

2198
01:31:56,599 --> 01:31:58,309
relationships and focus on your network

2199
01:31:58,309 --> 01:31:59,719
like I mentioned a little hack and

2200
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:02,119
Linkedin find ways like ms gizmos this

2201
01:32:02,119 --> 01:32:03,889
mentioned that's amazing hack your way

2202
01:32:03,889 --> 01:32:06,020
into these you know this is what the

2203
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,119
field is cybersecurity like fine hack

2204
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:09,920
your way in you know build those

2205
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,139
relationships and it'll be so much

2206
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:14,540
easier to to get where you want to go

2207
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,449
but again like take with a grain of salt

2208
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:18,980
you know so if you have your degree

2209
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,869
amazing if you have the certs amazing

2210
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:22,550
you know doesn't hurt you go after the

2211
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:23,929
search so as long as it's not cost

2212
01:32:23,929 --> 01:32:28,429
prohibitive for you but definitely try

2213
01:32:28,429 --> 01:32:30,739
to get around those those gatekeepers as

2214
01:32:30,739 --> 01:32:32,270
best you can because I can tell you from

2215
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:33,800
firsthand experience if the hiring

2216
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,739
manager the security guy or girl in that

2217
01:32:36,739 --> 01:32:39,530
organization knows you sees you or knows

2218
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,900
someone you know or so for the stone you

2219
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,119
know the six degrees of separation

2220
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:45,679
they'll they'll push you through I

2221
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,929
promise you Amy and whoever else is on

2222
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:49,159
this call that's wondering about that

2223
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:52,130
kind of thing I want him I want I want

2224
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,020
Amy I don't care what you say I don't

2225
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:55,699
care if she checks all those boxes

2226
01:32:55,699 --> 01:32:57,739
I want her they'll get you through the

2227
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,719
gatekeepers better than having the

2228
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:02,420
perfectly crafted resume and all the all

2229
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,250
the degrees inserts that you could ever

2230
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,409
want like that will take you way further

2231
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:08,780
so that's why I'm a huge proponent of

2232
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:11,510
you know networking and getting out of

2233
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:13,460
that you know she'll I wanted to say

2234
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,210
this I couldn't think of the word

2235
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:16,489
earlier but introvert like a lot of us I

2236
01:33:16,489 --> 01:33:18,650
find an IT are introverted you know

2237
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:21,619
we're to ourselves but we can be social

2238
01:33:21,619 --> 01:33:23,420
butterflies when we get around people

2239
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:24,949
who are passionate about what we're

2240
01:33:24,949 --> 01:33:27,380
passionate about and when you network

2241
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,750
with those people it helps you get out

2242
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:31,970
of that so to speak introverted shell

2243
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:34,250
because they're right up the same alley

2244
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:36,770
as you are as far as what you want to do

2245
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:39,530
in your career so definitely reach out

2246
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,180
to those people find those people and

2247
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,460
make that a priority like I said for me

2248
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,560
my personal opinion experience over

2249
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,720
everything networking and then degrees

2250
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,030
inserts fall under that like I said for

2251
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:51,890
you know that'll be whatever the

2252
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:53,900
gatekeepers want to see but your network

2253
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,930
is gonna squash all that if you are

2254
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:59,000
passionate now you know not wasting

2255
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,550
anyone's time not you know you say you

2256
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,840
want to do something but you really

2257
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,240
don't show it with your projects and

2258
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,280
with your experience so absolutely make

2259
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,020
