2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,860
now

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,799

for coming again uh

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
today uh it seems like things are

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,480
somehow

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
leveling and then we're starting to hear

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
about hybrid events uh

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,279
we probably are not gonna do anything in

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,240
person yet

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,679
um maybe we would look at

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,159
the last part of the year and see how

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,960
things go

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,559
if we don't get a twindemic or a uh

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,160
something worse and see how things are

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,719
going it seems like for the most part

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
most of us that

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
have either managed to stay employee and

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
and and do okay or soon we'll get

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
another job that the ones that

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
that lost jobs had for the most part

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
being

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,480

help please go on the jobs channel

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,760

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
the positions that are not advertised or

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,199

33
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,640
push you in or help you um today we're

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
going to have two

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
uh presenters that i know very well

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
uh one of those phil berlo he's going to

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
talk about gnu radio

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
and then we have tony which is an old

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
schooler

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
i work with tony already we work with

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,799
tonya jask and

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
tony is an awesome researcher and uh

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
he's very passionate about that

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
intelligence and uh he's going to talk

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,920
to us about this

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
and i'll suggest you to pay a lot of

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
attention because you can use this

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
and you can use it for your own

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,479
investigations

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
um before we get started uh again i'll

51
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,119
thank you

52
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,200
if you have any feedback i read

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
somewhere in the

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
slack that somehow discord kill our

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
channel that's very sad to read

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
i know honestly i don't know what to do

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
about it i don't know if

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,960
if we should go back or what or we were

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,840
using a bot

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,399
and the bot seems to be patching up

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,439
things a little bit

62
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,640
but uh i do feel like the

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,440
momentum has decreased with the adoption

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
of uh

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
discord you know we had all this

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,760
expectations about this score

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
and it turned out to be an absolute

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
disaster um

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
so there's something that i'm i'm gonna

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
put this out there for you guys to try

71
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,879
to figure out how well we do should we

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,319
go back to slack and

73
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,720
stick to it or because i feel like in

74
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,680
between both

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,160
we're losing communication i myself

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
sometimes i log in and i'm like oh my

77
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,519
god i lost this huge threat that was

78
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
incredibly interesting i could have

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
i could have got some of it i could have

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
uh collaborated with it so i'm a little

81
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
concerned about the whole discord thing

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,879
i know the kids like it

83
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
um and they all do their dj and their

84
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,959
stuff and that's pretty cool but

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,040
it seems like the majority of the people

86
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,959
are not getting it i'm sorry and i

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,920
include myself

88
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,959
in in that group but i i'm so what

89
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
lost in this discord thing and

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
after deathcore you know honestly i got

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
a pretty bad flavor out of it

92
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
like a defcon had to do support sessions

93
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
and

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
it was not good it was it was convoluted

95
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
and i don't mind using it and keeping it

96
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
as a backup but

97
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,640
uh um i feel like we we don't have what

98
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
we used to have

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
that's my perception as of today i'm not

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,680
sure if you guys agree with me or not

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,640
but

102
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
but definitely i'm not the only one like

103
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,319
there's been people posting

104
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,640
and saying hey this is not this is sort

105
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
of lost

106
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,239
momentum so i'm gonna put this out there

107
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,519
um

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
we are gonna continue meeting online

109
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
until we make a decision

110
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
uh the next big event uh which i will

111
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,120
let

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
um danielle announce it uh is

113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,120

114

uh which is our friends in uh and and

117
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
orlando which usually put up a great

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
conference

119
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
uh other than that i'll um keep

120
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,560
participating

121
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
come up with ideas so we can fix this uh

122
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,840
discord slack thing and uh

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
um i leave you guys with uh danielle

124
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,159
so thank you everyone now that he has um

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,920
told you all about uh discord so uh

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
we're gonna circle back to that in a

127
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
second so uh

128
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
south florida issa uh chili cook-off

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
hack the flag which would normally be

130
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
uh but we can't really figure out a way

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
to do the chili cook-off so

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
uh you're certainly welcome to make your

133
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
chili at home make two batches

134
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
enlist your spouse and list your kids

135
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
you know battle it out amongst

136
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
each other that's fine however more

137
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,000
importantly um

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
we will be holding we will be holding

139
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
the conference in a hybrid situation a

140
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
different hybrid than what rod's talking

141
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,680
about

142
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
but we're actually going to have the

143
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
lobbies and everything in discord

144
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
now that has rod has hyped all that up

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
and gotten everybody excited about

146
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,600
discord

147
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,759
uh so discord will be the uh common

148
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,280
meeting place uh for

149
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
chatting uh finding your teams and

150
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,400
everything

151
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,360
uh we are not going to be say i don't

152
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,199
like to set myself up for failure i set

153
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,600
myself

154
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
up for success so we're not actually

155
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
going to be presenting the sessions

156
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,479
uh via discord it will just be the place

157
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
for everybody to mill and talk

158
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
um i will be doing my thing i will be

159
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
using zoom to present the talk so we're

160
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
not gonna have those issues

161
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,680
um and uh i will handle that uh we will

162
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
also have the ctfs there's going to be a

163
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
beginner ctf and advanced ctf

164
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,759
and our very own rod is in charge of the

165
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
advanced obviously

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
so we'll have some fun working on that

167
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
like i said everybody will mill around

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
inside discord you can find your teams

169
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,639
there we're going to create team

170
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
channels so everyone can

171
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,759
uh you know get together and talk and

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,280
share your um

173
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
clues and experiences and everything so

174
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
it'll be similar to what we did in

175
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
person where everybody sat at the table

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,120
the gnu radio and uh

220
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,960
various other things in here i saw a

221
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
little bit of his presentation earlier

let me go ahead and share my screen and

236
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,560
pull up the presentation

237
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,280
so this is an introduction to gnu radio

238
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,919
um

239
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
for those of you who are at my last

240
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,199
presentation on

241
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
uh software-defined radio this is

242
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,319
basically a

243
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
direct sequel to that um a follow-up to

244
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,639
what was covered there

245
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,879
there is a lot of overlap with that in

246
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,680
fact i

247
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
just straight up stole a bunch of the

248
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
slides from my last one

249
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,919
um so hopefully we'll be reviewing some

250
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,280
of the concepts

251
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
so who am i uh my name is philip borlau

252
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
i am a senior security engineer at

253
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,879
vigilant security

254
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
i'm also a licensed technician class ham

255
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
operator since 2018

256
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
um but really my only real qualification

257
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
for this is that i'm a hobbyist

258
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
um been interested in radio wi-fi

259
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,279
bluetooth

260
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
software-defined radio in general for

261
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,279
about 10-15 years now

262
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,958
given a few talks here at hack miami

263
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,919
related to radio as i said one on sdr

264
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,279
a few others on bluetooth um but really

265
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,880
i'm not an expert in this field

266
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,200
and this talk is really just to give you

267
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,080
a sample

268
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
of sdr radio

269
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
and these concepts from a hobbyist

270
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,319
perspective

271
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
so a little agenda for what we're going

272
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
to be talking about today

273
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,839
um i'm going to be starting off by

274
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,760
talking about some just basic radio

275
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,640
concepts to give us some some foundation

276
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,560
then be going into some digital signal

277
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,240
processing and software-defined radio

278
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
concepts again just the basics just the

279
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
foundation level stuff

280
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,360
and then talk about the foundational

281
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
aspects of gnu radio

282
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
and where that fits into the picture and

283
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
then in the last about 15 minutes

284
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
i'm gonna transition to a demo and cover

285
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
all the concepts that we covered up to

286
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,480
there

287
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
and show you a demonstration of what it

288
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
looks like in gnu radio to see like an

289
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
am radio an fm radio

290
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
or even to demodulate digital signals

291
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
like on off king

292
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
important note though is i there's a lot

293
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
of stuff i'm not going to be covering

294
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
today

295
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
software defined radio and digital

296
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,360
signal processing is a

297
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,320
pretty deep field uh you know it's got a

298
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
you have to have a background in

299
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,399
electrical engineering

300
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
to to really understand a lot of these

301
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,680
concepts deep

302
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,920
so i'm going to be skipping over a ton

303
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
of stuff i would recommend though that

304
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,079
you guys

305
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,399
kind of follow up a lot of this talk is

306
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,160
based on this three volume series

307
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,200
field expedient sdr um all of the

308
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
examples i'm giving today are pulled

309
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,079
exactly from

310
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,959
their site fieldxp.com it's free you

311
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,000
don't have to buy the book to get

312
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
the examples so uh if anything i show

313
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
here interests you

314
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
i recommend you go on there and download

315
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
the samples and just play around with it

316
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,959
and the second thing is uh michael

317
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
osmond the creator of the hack

318
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,000
rf put out a great 11 part video series

319
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
again free at their site that walks

320
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,360
through basically everything we're going

321
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,560
to be covering here today

322
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
in gnu radio so i recommend you guys go

323
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,920
check that out

324
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
so let's start with the real basics and

325
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,360
i assume

326
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
um a lot of you guys i'll

327
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
i'll show you guys uh the book titles at

328
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
the end but basically

329
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,640
um just answer a question in chat it's

330
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
an introduction to

331
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
software defined radio field expedient

332
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
sdr it's a three volume series you can

333
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
find it on

334
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
amazon and i will be linking to it after

335
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
the talk

336
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,079
so some radio basics um

337
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,160
you know the basic ideas of a sine wave

338
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,519
you have your amplitude

339
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,519
um when that comes to sound that's how

340
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,360
loud you're speaking you can see that

341
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,160
uh here the amplitude is shown by the

342
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,200
y-axis

343
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,959
you have your frequency right um the

344
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
shorter the period the higher the

345
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,279
frequency

346
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,279
um these are some pretty basic concepts

347
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,640
and then one that might be

348
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
unfamiliar to some of you are as phase

349
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,079
um and so

350
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,360
two different waves of the same

351
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,800
frequency and amplitude can have a

352
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
different phase and that just means that

353
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,920
basically they're different places in

354
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
the wave so if you were to take these

355
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
two lines as being like second markers

356
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
the red wave would be at a value of zero

357
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
at three seconds where

358
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
the blue wave would be at a value of

359
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
zero at four seconds

360
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
right so just where upon that wave that

361
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
is and these are the basic

362
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,120
aspects of a wave that we'll see

363
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
another really important concept here is

364
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
uh called the fourier transform and this

365
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
is really a foundational concept to

366
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
digital signal processing and

367
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,120
signals in general um and it's the idea

368
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,200
that any complex waveform that you have

369
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,639
like up here this might be an audio

370
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
waveform or radio signal

371
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,200
it looks complicated but you can break

372
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
that down

373
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,440
into a series of simple waveforms

374
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,040
and this is a really important concepts

375
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
in radio

376
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
this chart down here at the bottom left

377
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
is what we call an fft

378
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
plot a fast fourier transform plot and

379
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
instead of showing you know the

380
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
amplitude over time what it shows us is

381
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
the amplitude versus frequency

382
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
and this allows us to see which

383
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,440
frequencies

384
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
are the largest component of this

385
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
complex wave and so to read this chart

386
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
we would see these two big spikes

387
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
indicate that those two frequencies uh

388
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
make up the largest portion of this

389
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
wave but we also see you know there are

390
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,920
a bunch of other frequencies all

391
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
throughout here that make it up

392
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
and this is just a fundamental concept

393
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
of signal processing

394
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,680
the last thing here is i want to show

395
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
you is a waterfall graph so

396
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
whereas this shows us amplitude over

397
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,639
time this graph shows us amplitude over

398
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,000
frequency

399
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,680
the waterfall kind of gives us the best

400
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
of both worlds so we can see

401
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,959
the intensity shows us the amplitude the

402
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,959
frequency is shown by the x-axis and the

403
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
y-axis is time so we kind of see all

404
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,079
three of them at once

405
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,839
and these are just three different ways

406
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,600
that we can visualize waves and they'll

407
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,959
come up throughout the rest of the talk

408
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
so let's talk about a few radio

409
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
components and components we're going to

410
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
be seeing coming up in basically any

411
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,760
radio system you're going to see you're

412
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,240
going to see

413
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,079
a mix of these components so the first

414
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,279
one is pretty straightforward it's an

415
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,560
amplifier a lot of you are probably

416
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
familiar with it

417
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,680
doesn't change the frequency doesn't

418
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
change the phase it simply just

419
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
amplifies the amplitude of the wave

420
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
pretty straightforward

421
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,639
filters um you know as the name implies

422
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,160
filters out frequencies

423
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
so if we imagine these images here um

424
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
are a fast a fourier transform

425
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,519
you can see these lines as being which

426
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,760
frequencies would be allowed through

427
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
and and that's just basic concepts so a

428
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
low pass would allow any frequencies

429
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
below a certain frequency through

430
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
high pass the opposite any frequencies

431
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
above a certain frequency are allowed

432
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,279
through

433
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,920
band pass allows a certain frequency

434
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
range allowed through and a band reject

435
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,639
or band stop

436
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,320
rejects a certain range of frequencies

437
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
and then the third concept is a mixer

438
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,360
and this simply is a way of combining

439
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
two signals so

440
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
this is the first place that i'm going

441
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,279
to kind of brush over but what i want

442
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
you to get out of the mixer is you can

443
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,480
combine two signals

444
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,199
and the output is either going to be

445
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,639
it's used for two things one is

446
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,160
amplitude modulation which we'll talk

447
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,199
about in a second

448
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,320
and the other is for shifting

449
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
frequencies so you can have a frequency

450
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:44,880
come in

451
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
put another frequency and it will shift

452
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
that frequency over

453
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
and that concept will also come up in a

454
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,800
little bit

455
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
so let's actually talk about how this

456
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
might come into use how waves are used

457
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
uh let's talk about a speaker and a

458
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,920
microphone

459
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
right so when you talk you are producing

460
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
uh vibrations in

461
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,639
air air uh air pressure waves and human

462
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,639
hearing occurs at around 20 hertz to

463
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
around 20 kilohertz

464
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,600
middle c is around 261 hertz

465
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,199
right so let's say you want to play uh

466
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
record that and play that into a speaker

467
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
you take a microphone you sing middle c

468
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
that's going to vibrate a

469
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
diaphragm back and forth that has a

470
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,519
magnet on it next to a wire

471
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
and that's going to vibrate back at 261

472
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
hertz and cause an electrical impulse to

473
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,800
go down that wire

474
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,320
at 261 hertz right

475
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
to play that back you just play that

476
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
into a speaker which is an electromagnet

477
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
and a magnet and it's going to push that

478
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,160
diaphragm

479
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,880
at 261 hertz and cause the air to

480
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,600
vibrate

481
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,279
pretty straightforward but let's say you

482
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
want to play this over radio

483
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,279
um well 261 hertz is is extremely

484
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
extremely low for radio that's the kind

485
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,560
of frequencies that they communicate

486
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,920
with like submarines with

487
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
you need an antenna that's miles long

488
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,199
and you know

489
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
extreme power drops that's not going to

490
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
work for us right so we need to

491
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
encode the information that we have the

492
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
audio at around 261 hertz

493
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
onto another wave that's going to carry

494
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,519
our

495
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
our um our information at a frequency

496
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
that we can actually work with

497
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
right so we're working at 261 hertz

498
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
but we're going to be using a frequency

499
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,000
for am which is around

500
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
500 kilohertz to 1500 kilohertz or 1600

501
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
kilohertz

502
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
right so how do we do that well this

503
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,720
brings back up um our idea of a mixer

504
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,079
and you can see this little animation

505
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,920
here we have our carrier wave

506
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,959
this am uh frequency and we have our

507
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,320
modulated signal this is our

508
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,839
our audio signal and we're putting in

509
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,279
through a mixer and you see it doesn't

510
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
actually change the frequency at least

511
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
in the same modulation it doesn't change

512
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,680
the frequency

513
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
of our carrier it changes the amplitude

514
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,160
and so we can see there are multiple

515
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
ways of encoding information here and

516
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
this is how this is just the basic idea

517
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
of modulation of how we can take a

518
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
carrier wave and take information and

519
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
put it on top and this works not just

520
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
for analog signals but we see how

521
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,839
down here it works for digital signals

522
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,000
too

523
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
um and so let's let's actually talk

524
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
about a few different ways that you can

525
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
encode information on waves

526
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,640
right so we talked about amplitude

527
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
modulation you know you can

528
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,079
have your carrier you have your input

529
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,400
and it comes out varying the amplitude

530
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,839
well we can do the same thing with

531
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
frequency um we bring in the same

532
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,400
input same carrier but now instead of

533
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,839
changing the amplitude we're changing

534
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,679
the frequency of the wave

535
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
right um and then this also works and

536
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
this last picture just shows that this

537
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
also works for digital

538
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,039
signals so let's let's actually go

539
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
through these we're familiar with am

540
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
amplitude modulation

541
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,679
when you do this for a digital signal

542
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
this is called amplitude shift keying

543
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,280
um and there are multiple forms of it

544
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,480
one that we'll see later in this

545
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
presentation is called on off keying and

546
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,960
it's just a

547
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,280
very simple form of digital amplitude

548
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
modulation

549
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
um you're probably also familiar with fm

550
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,760
radio um

551
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,679
in terms of digital that would be called

552
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,520
frequency shift king

553
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,799
mfsk is multiple frequency shift king

554
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,960
you can use more than two frequencies it

555
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
doesn't just have to be binary and this

556
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
kind of brings up the idea that

557
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,559
uh you can encode a lot more information

558
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,240
if you use more steps

559
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
um but in it sometimes brings in an

560
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,320
additional complexity or additional

561
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
error rate so there's balances there

562
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
and then the third one which might be

563
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,320
less obvious is uh phase modulation so

564
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
the phase is the third attribute of the

565
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
wave that we talked about and you can

566
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
use that to encode information so phase

567
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,679
modulation and phase shift king

568
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,280
and then the fourth one again i am

569
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,120
completely skipping over this uh

570
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
quadratures

571
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
in phase and quadratures is kind of a an

572
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,559
artifact of digital signal processing

573
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,640
completely leaving it out i touched on

574
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,559
it a bit in my last talk

575
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
the only reason i'm bringing it up here

576
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,600
is if you look into things like how

577
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,080
wi-fi

578
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
works and how modulated there it tends

579
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
to use quadrature type modulation

580
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
just bring it up in case you run into

581
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,960
that

582
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
so we've talked about how we can encode

583
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
information on waves

584
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
but we don't want to be stuck to one one

585
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,200
radio station the radio is not great if

586
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
it can only tune into one station so you

587
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,360
want to be able to

588
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
tune it around and go to multiple

589
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,640
stations so how do we do that well

590
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,080
um we can broadcast information on

591
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
multiple different frequencies or

592
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,679
channels in this case probably familiar

593
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,720
with that

594
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,000
and use filters to you know filter only

595
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
the channel you want and filter and get

596
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
rid of everything else

597
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
great the problem is that that filters

598
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
making a filter that you can tune that

599
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
you can change which frequencies work

600
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
for while possible is

601
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
really complicated really expensive it's

602
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
not the way we want to do it

603
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
they figured out a long time ago that

604
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,559
the way to do this is to

605
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,160
make a fixed filter that works for a

606
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
single frequency a single range of

607
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
frequencies

608
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,640
and then shift around the frequencies we

609
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
brought this up earlier a mixer can

610
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
actually change the frequency

611
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,840
and shift it around and so that's that's

612
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,880
the way we're going to do this we're

613
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,840
going to

614
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,039
use a local oscillator to shift the

615
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,000
incoming frequency

616
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
to to meet the filter that we have um

617
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
and this is a concept called heterodyne

618
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
uh and it's a concept here called

619
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,400
superheterodyne receiver

620
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,159
um and so when you tune that dial on

621
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,919
your radio what you're changing is not

622
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,200
the filter you're changing the

623
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
the the waveform of a local oscillator

624
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,039
that you're mixing into the incoming

625
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,520
frequency that's going to move it around

626
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
right now this introduces a few kind of

627
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,200
uh

628
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
issues uh one being an image again this

629
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,799
is one of these

630
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,640
aspects i'm kind of kind of brushed

631
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
right over um but it does

632
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
introduce kind of like artifacts like

633
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,640
mirages uh harmonics of the frequency

634
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
that we have to be aware of and it kind

635
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
of produces some

636
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
limitations of this in terms of how how

637
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
broad we can make these filters

638
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
but this is a basic concept that is

639
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,840
basically at the the foundation of all

640
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,559
radios since the 30s um right

641
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
so as i said most of what we've covered

642
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
is is basic radio concepts have been

643
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
true since like the 30s um so

644
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,200
what about software-defined radio well

645
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
it's the idea of radio where we

646
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
implement some of the components we've

647
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
been talking about like mixers and

648
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,159
amplifiers we're doing some of that in

649
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,440
software

650
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
now i say some of that because the

651
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
majority of it

652
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
is still being done in in hardware um i

653
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,559
have a hack rf i guess i don't have it

654
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,919
around me right now but

655
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
um we talk about like the first and

656
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,200
second stage here are still

657
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
being done in hardware it's really only

658
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,520
the modulation that did the demodulation

659
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,320
of the signal

660
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,760
that's being done in software why is

661
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
this important um in your car radio your

662
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
car radio can really only do fm and a i

663
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,320
mean those are

664
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,400
two different components in that radio

665
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,280
but it can't decode tv signals it can't

666
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
decode you know xm radio software

667
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
defined radio as long as the antenna and

668
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
the receivers are tuned for those

669
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
frequencies it can just change how it

670
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
demodulates so it's a lot more flexible

671
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
it does introduce some drawbacks and the

672
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,039
main one being it's limited by the

673
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,000
sample rate

674
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
um so let's actually get into that what

675
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,600
is

676
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,799
sampling um this is this conversion from

677
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,640
the analog to digital domain analog

678
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
signals are continuous it means they're

679
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
they have a defined value at every point

680
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
in time

681
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,159
right digital on the other hand it is as

682
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,360
it's it's discrete

683
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,159
it exists as discrete ones and zeros uh

684
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:02,880
which means

685
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
that the resolution is a factor here

686
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
the the rate at which you sample the

687
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
signal is going to determine the

688
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
resolution of the signal

689
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
and we can see here up top an analog

690
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,280
signal and it's digital representation

691
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
these bars are you know

692
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,240
an estimation why is this important well

693
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,320
if you're sampling at a rate that

694
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,919
doesn't match your signal you're going

695
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,039
to see a signal

696
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,320
that isn't true this top rate is is

697
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
based on these dots this is

698
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,760
you know a pretty good guess at what the

699
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
signal probably looked like but

700
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
the sample below is showing you that if

701
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
you had a really fast signal

702
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
that that was much faster than your

703
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
sampling rate you're going to get a

704
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
mirage you're going to get this this

705
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,159
false signal it looks like it's much

706
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,080
larger and it's just because it happened

707
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,159
to coincide if you've ever seen like a

708
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
rolling shutter with a

709
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,440
with you know propeller blades where you

710
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
you snap shots at different times

711
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
that's this effect so it introduces this

712
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,440
idea that you have to be cognizant of

713
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
what's the frequency you're sampling and

714
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
how fast are you sampling it

715
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,039
um and it's going to introduce some

716
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,120
artifacts

717
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
so that's software to find radio let's

718
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,600
talk about gnu radio specifically

719
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,280
um so gnu radio is a software

720
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,559
development toolkit for signal

721
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,679
processing

722
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
um it's written in in python and c so

723
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:16,960
it's basically

724
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,799
a set of libraries that you can do a lot

725
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,360
of what we're talking about implementing

726
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,679
you know mixers and filters and

727
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,679
amplifiers you can do that in software

728
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,360
and it allows you to do that

729
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,600
it's cross-platform but what i'm going

730
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,440
to be showing you today is gnu radio

731
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,240
companion

732
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
and that's a wysiwyg interface that's

733
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
built on top of it so you don't have to

734
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,159
traditionally go to radio you would be

735
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,760
you know programming in python

736
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
this allows you to do everything

737
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,919
completely without touching code

738
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,080
which is nice especially it reduces the

739
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
barrier to entry

740
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,840
um i do want to make it clear though for

741
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,960
those getting

742
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
into software-defined radio you probably

743
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,679
aren't going to want to touch gnu radio

744
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,320
um for most applications like receiving

745
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,880
tv broadcasts decoding images

746
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,200
speaking am there are purpose-built

747
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,799
applications it's probably what you want

748
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,080
to use

749
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,600
um gnu radio is is like you know the raw

750
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
tools so this is useful for if you're

751
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
building new applications

752
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
or um if you're learning digital signal

753
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
processing or reverse engineering a new

754
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,320
signal

755
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,039
um it will allow you to break it down

756
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,559
every step along the way

757
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
visualize it and kind of debug what's

758
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,600
going on

759
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
um i just want to tell you most of you

760
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,039
guys if you want to get into you know

761
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,559
radio and sdr

762
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,840
you probably don't need to touch gnu

763
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,080
radio or you'll find people save

764
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
files who have already implemented it

765
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,039
who really understand digital signal

766
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,840
processing

767
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,279
and you'll use it but it's fun to be

768
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,120
able to play around and see what's going

769
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,760
on

770
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,960
and then the last one i'll put up here

771
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
and i'll just throw this out to save you

772
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,200
guys some headache

773
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
don't run it on a vm when we come to

774
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,360
sample rates and and frequencies

775
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,480
uh the latency introduced with

776
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,559
um the latency introduced with a vm

777
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,480
just causes all sorts of issues so try

778
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,559
and install on bear hardware

779
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,840
i'll go over a few of the kind of basic

780
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
components of gnu radio here before we

781
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
get into some of the demos

782
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
so the first few are variables and gnu

783
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
and gui entries

784
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,080
um the idea being that throughout your

785
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,919
entire uh schematic

786
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,840
you're going to have amplifiers and

787
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,880
mixes that are set to certain

788
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
frequencies or sample rates and it's

789
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,159
annoying to have to update those

790
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,240
all over the place right um

791
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,960
so having variables in good entry box

792
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,799
gui entry boxes allows you to just

793
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,000
implement it once reference it

794
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,679
throughout your code and just update in

795
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,799
one place and it'll allow you to

796
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,480
actually like implement tuners like when

797
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
you make an am radio we can have just

798
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
a slider to to move what radio stations

799
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,720
return to uh sources as the name

800
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,159
suggests is the source of information

801
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,320
this can be things like a file source uh

802
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
it can be you know a wav file it can be

803
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,000
a hardware source

804
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,760
such as a an sdr um or it can be

805
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,279
like an array i'll show you in the on

806
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,039
off keying section it should we'll just

807
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,559
have an array of zeros and ones that we

808
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,760
feed into our

809
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,640
um flowchart syncs are the opposite it's

810
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,320
it's where we're putting our information

811
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,840
so just like we can read from a file we

812
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
can save to a file um

813
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,240
when it comes to audio like a am radio

814
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,440
afm radio we can

815
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,799
put it out to an audio sync and put it

816
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,640
out to our speakers or

817
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
um you know any sorts of uh types of the

818
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,159
really important ones

819
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,960
are the gui sinks these are visual

820
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
outputs that allow us to see

821
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
uh we talked earlier about things like

822
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
the um fast fourier transform plot that

823
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,159
allows to see the frequency over time

824
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
um and it'll just be able to allow us to

825
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
visualize what's going on that's

826
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,080
probably the most

827
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,520
important tool in all of this um

828
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,039
radio components as we talked about

829
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,360
mixers amplifiers filters those are all

830
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
uh implemented as components um

831
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,559
obviously i'm not going to get

832
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,360
too much into it we can you know i'll

833
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,080
show a little

834
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,279
a few of them off in the demo um

835
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
type converters this is an important

836
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,279
idea in gnu radio

837
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,279
um there are different forms of

838
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,400
information

839
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,000
um they come in different formats and

840
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
you have to be cognizant of them as

841
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
you're moving them around your system

842
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,919
complex numbers floats integers binary

843
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:15,120
representations um they are all

844
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
are all color coded within gnu radio and

845
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,279
you will be having to convert from one

846
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
to another

847
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,919
and it just adds a little bit of

848
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,480
complexity to

849
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,799
just some of these flowcharts uh sample

850
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,679
rate related

851
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,120
um again we were talking about how

852
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,799
sample rate comes into digital signal

853
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,520
processing

854
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,960
as you go throughout your flow chart

855
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
there are going to be a lot of

856
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,720
components that

857
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,360
um either decimate or interpolate either

858
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
fill in data where there wasn't any or

859
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,279
get

860
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,840
throw away data where it's not necessary

861
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
as you're transitioning from one sample

862
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
rate to another

863
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
again another topic i'm going to be

864
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
completely skipping over since i don't

865
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,799
have the time

866
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,279
and then stuff like math some of the

867
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,640
basic ones like multiply or how you

868
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,080
implement mixers

869
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,600
but you can do all sorts of mathematical

870
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,959
functions in gnu radio

871
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,679
that is the presentation portion so with

872
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,039
that uh that should give us the

873
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,640
foundation to actually start jumping

874
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
into some demos

875
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,440
um so this is gonna radio companion uh

876
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,840
this

877
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
is i i modified a few of the examples

878
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,080
that came out of this field expedient

879
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,720
sdr

880
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
uh book and it will walk you through

881
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,279
most of these examples

882
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,200
um and you can see here a few of what we

883
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,159
were talking about so we have things

884
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,919
like a file source and this is a source

885
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,320
uh from the radio example so i didn't

886
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,919
have to hook it up to a radio these are

887
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,120
you know a capture

888
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,159
um of an am broadcast you have things

889
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:34,880
like

890
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
text boxes and frequent variables to

891
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
keep track of our sample rate and what

892
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
frequency we want to attune to and what

893
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,960
the center frequency of the filter is

894
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
and stuff like that

895
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,960
and then we can actually see you know uh

896
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
we talked about the heterodyne radio

897
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
and and we have things like

898
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,760
a mixer here and a low-pass filter

899
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,559
and uh an am modulator and what this

900
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
allows us to do is we can see we have

901
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,039
things like

902
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,399
gui syncs here that allow us to

903
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,559
visualize these signals as it works its

904
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,919
way through our system so let's go ahead

905
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,440
and actually boot this up we'll we'll go

906
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
ahead and run it

907
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,919
and we'll pop up is our signal so let's

908
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,120
go through this here's our here's our

909
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,840
ama

910
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,440
input right here's the signal that is

911
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
coming out of our file

912
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,080
and here's what's coming out of our

913
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,039
multiplier they look very similar and if

914
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,919
if you notice

915
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,279
look at this peak it's been shifted over

916
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,559
well that's that's exactly what we were

917
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,399
talking about our mixer was doing we

918
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:28,960
input

919
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
a sine wave a cosine wave in this case

920
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
uh what is that 20 kilohertz

921
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,279
cosine wave and we're shifting this

922
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,559
frequency over

923
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
so this is an example of what's going on

924
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,559
in a super heterodyne

925
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,720
receiver where we're shifting it over to

926
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
from its you know what is this

927
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,080
running at around 900 kilohertz

928
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,840
right a radio frequency around 880

929
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,120
here though it's around zero this zero

930
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
is shifting it over for our filter our

931
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
filter is built around zero

932
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
right so this is one of the ways you can

933
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,279
kind of

934
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,799
visualize this as it's going through so

935
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
let's actually pull out and and see

936
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,640
disable these outputs now guys i know

937
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,679
you guys are answering a lot of

938
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,360
questions i will look at those at the

939
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,399
end of the talk and

940
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,919
uh cover all of them um

941
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,600
so there's our output let's actually

942
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,640
look as it goes from our multiply output

943
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,720
to our filtered output after our low

944
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,399
pass filter

945
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,159
all right so let's run it again here's

946
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,600
all our filters and we can see all these

947
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
spikes are likely other

948
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,000
radio stations they're on other channels

949
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,919
we've shifted this to zero and as we see

950
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,559
we've now removed everything around it

951
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,200
um so we've isolated just the am station

952
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
that we want to talk about and that's

953
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,159
what that low-pass filter is doing so

954
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,000
we're able to very easily visualize what

955
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,480
these components are doing

956
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
let's keep going let's disable that guy

957
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,840
and let's

958
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,120
um enable the final output and

959
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,559
a uh audio sync

960
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,360
and there we go look at that so here's

961
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
the radio station the channel

962
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
and here's the actual audio waveform as

963
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
it's coming out at the end

964
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,559
um and so in in a really quick way we've

965
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
demonstrated uh that super heterodyne

966
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,440
receiver with an am radio station and

967
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,480
broken it down and

968
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
and this shows how gnu radio can be used

969
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
as a really good tool

970
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,159
for sean for showing what's going on in

971
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,720
each step in the process

972
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,399
um so now jumping over let me show you a

973
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,360
quick example

974
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,559
of a um

975
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,240
of an fm broadcaster and receiver so

976
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
in in in our last example i was showing

977
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,840
pulling from a file

978
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,080
right so someone received a file um in

979
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
probably a software defined radio and

980
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,799
then and throw it just directly into a

981
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,240
file for processing later

982
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
and that's actually what sdr is great

983
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
for pulling from files and and you know

984
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,480
analyzing signals after the fact

985
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
but in this case we're actually drawing

986
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,840
from a wav file this is just an audio

987
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
source so we are going to be

988
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,000
going through broadcasting and then

989
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,720
receiving

990
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,880
in the same diagram so what comes out at

991
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,919
the end

992
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,919
you know this is basically just a fancy

993
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,039
way

994
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,080
of playing a wav file but we're

995
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,200
we're simulating it going through um an

996
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,320
fm broadcast

997
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,799
so this is a little bit more complicated

998
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,720
um am is much more straightforward to

999
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
implement than fm

1000
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
uh so i'm not going to go through what

1001
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
each one of these blocks does but we can

1002
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,279
see here we have things like

1003
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,880
um a transmitter um

1004
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,360
this uh excellating fr filter is just a

1005
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,480
fancy way of doing

1006
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
shifting with a mixer and filtering all

1007
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,159
in one which is just something that we

1008
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,519
do often

1009
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,279
um so let's actually you know let me

1010
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,039
disable the audios

1011
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,720
oh no i can't disable the audio sync

1012
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
it's going to yell at me

1013
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
when in the course of human events so we

1014
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,840
can see the audio

1015
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,679
in the course let me turn that down

1016
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,880
so here it's it's a similar

1017
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
implementation as we saw before now in

1018
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,080
this case we're using a different gui

1019
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,919
implementation and this allows us to

1020
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,559
switch

1021
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,320
how we visualize this so instead of just

1022
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
a frequency display we see okay this is

1023
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,840
at 98

1024
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,240
98 uh what is that probably megahertz

1025
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
okay

1026
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,679
we can also see it as a waterfall

1027
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,240
display and uh we start to see

1028
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,440
some of the issues that come up

1029
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,240
like aliasing these are uh filters that

1030
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,039
we need to

1031
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,399
now uh filter out right so

1032
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,080
just interesting that we can see um

1033
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,919
these different visualizations and it

1034
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,200
allows us to just

1035
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
identify the type of modulation from a

1036
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,960
distance and what's going on very

1037
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
quickly so

1038
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
i'm not going to spend too much time on

1039
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,399
an fm sample

1040
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,360
i think what's a little bit more

1041
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,840
interesting is this um

1042
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,960
this is an implementation of an on

1043
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,559
off king so our source here instead of

1044
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
being a file is literally just an array

1045
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,840
of ones and zeros that we want to

1046
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,720
transmit

1047
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,880
and we are going to see what this looks

1048
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,760
like

1049
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,360
um so let's start off we see what our

1050
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,519
digital input is it's a digital waveform

1051
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,399
you know

1052
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,599
one one zero one zero one zero one zero

1053
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,119
zero blah blah blah

1054
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,800
cool let's see what that looks like

1055
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,359
after we have you know modulated it

1056
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,359
so we go from a digital signal out to

1057
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,399
now this

1058
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,399
okay so we're getting spikes at this one

1059
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,760
frequency let's let's change the

1060
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,800
visualization here

1061
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,399
okay there's something over here let's

1062
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,839
change the contrast to make it a little

1063
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,879
bit more

1064
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,599
okay okay we got something now let's uh

1065
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,240
let's zoom in

1066
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,560
so there's our digital signal um on off

1067
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,079
king it's turning on and off

1068
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,960
um at this one frequency right so this

1069
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
is amplitude shift keying

1070
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,800
it's one frequency but the amplitude is

1071
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,719
going from nothing from off to on and

1072
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
showing as a spike here

1073
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,639
um and oh this is interesting a time

1074
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
domain display so we can actually see

1075
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,359
um it's pulsing you know on off on off

1076
00:34:59,359 --> 00:34:59,760
okay

1077
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,200
cool let's now go back

1078
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,280
um to the end here and turn off the last

1079
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,520
sink

1080
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,800
and play

1081
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
am i yelling me why is it yelling at me

1082
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,839
right now

1083
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,040
it can be a little temperamental

1084
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,839
what's it want from me

1085
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,680
do i have one running

1086
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,280
oh that's annoying

1087
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,640
yeah so as i said it can be a little bit

1088
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,000
temperamental sometimes let me see if i

1089
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,880
can get it to run

1090
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,000
generating flow graph okay

1091
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
and execute

1092
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,280
you can do it oh demo gods

1093
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
all right let me restart it real quick

1094
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:13,839
sorry about this guys

1095
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,359
all right we're right back where we were

1096
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,160
so let's play this

1097
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
and here we go so we see our digital

1098
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
input

1099
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
uh the frequency uh output and then how

1100
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,400
we're receiving it so it's a perfect

1101
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,359
replication

1102
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,200
um very cool one more example

1103
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,920
and then we'll wrap this up so this is a

1104
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,599
similar thing but it's showing

1105
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,160
a little bit more complicated and in

1106
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,720
this case

1107
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,839
we're actually using an access code um

1108
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,200
so in this case there's a static code

1109
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
coming across there's ones and zeros

1110
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920
coming across and we're looking for a

1111
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,359
preamble

1112
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,760
um it's a certain sets of ones and zeros

1113
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,000
that always precedes the code that we're

1114
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
looking for and it tells us that this is

1115
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
the code we're looking for it's not just

1116
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,720
random noise

1117
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,040
we can use things like this where we

1118
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
input what our preamble looks like and

1119
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,760
it will inject

1120
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,599
two so this is a binary signal we're

1121
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,960
talking about

1122
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,640
but it will inject a two into there so

1123
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,000
that you can identify where the start of

1124
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,720
your signal is

1125
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,959
so let's look at what that looks like

1126
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
right so here's the signal it's going to

1127
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
come across in a second there we go

1128
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,720
so the input into the demodulator it's

1129
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,079
uh on off king

1130
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,920
is the amplitude and what comes in is

1131
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,680
this waveform what comes out

1132
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
looks more like a digital signal cool so

1133
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
we're making a translation here

1134
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,160
let's go a little bit further let's turn

1135
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,880
off the input of the modulator

1136
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
look at the clean baseband all right

1137
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,359
so after a few more blocks we're going

1138
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,280
to take in what was a little bit of a

1139
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,400
rough signal

1140
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,320
and we're going to clean it up so this

1141
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,680
is the rough signal it's got peaks it's

1142
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,920
got overshoots um the timing might not

1143
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,960
be perfect and we're going to turn it

1144
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,320
into a nice

1145
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,680
clean digital signal that we're

1146
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,400
expecting cool

1147
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,599
let's disable that guy let's uh

1148
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,640
turn the time sync on and let's run it

1149
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,440
again

1150
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
so remember this is after the access

1151
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,160
code so what are we going to see

1152
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
all right this digital signal came in

1153
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,040
and it rises and then stays up

1154
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,200
but what we want is points in time we

1155
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,560
want some ones and zeros so we want to

1156
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,480
go from a square wave to a triangle wave

1157
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,760
so that's what this is because we're

1158
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
going to be writing this down into a

1159
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,839
file as ones and zeros

1160
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,400
this this peak two which obviously makes

1161
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,760
no sense in a binary

1162
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,400
format this is our access code so this

1163
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,119
is what that block did to tell us hey

1164
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,320
here's the start of your signal

1165
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,520
everything after this is the data

1166
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,400
cool so let's turn this guy off let's uh

1167
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,079
enable the file sync

1168
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,839
let's run this one more time

1169
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,320
let's wait for the signal to come in

1170
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,079
there's our signal okay

1171
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,359
cool let's go ahead and open

1172
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,560
up our um

1173
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
a new radio example in here okay

1174
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,839
bin let's open this up and so here's our

1175
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,119
output

1176
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,040
we can see most of the time it's off but

1177
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,880
every once in a while we have ones and

1178
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,240
zeros here in a file

1179
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,040
and if we look carefully there should be

1180
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
here let me scroll a little bit further

1181
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,280
down

1182
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,200
here a two so we now have a file that we

1183
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,240
can pipe into like

1184
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,079
a python script or whatever we want to

1185
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
start to start taking this apart here's

1186
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,119
our data here's ones and zeros here's

1187
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,640
our binary of whatever we want to

1188
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,280
transmit across our data so this is how

1189
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
you can take the new radio um and start

1190
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,280
taking in an arbitrary signal

1191
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,880
something straightforward like a on off

1192
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,400
king and actually start playing around

1193
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
with it in in a system

1194
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,400
um you know create applications around

1195
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,440
it put it into a python script

1196
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,640
um yeah and that's it uh i think that

1197
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
covers the majority of what i wanted to

1198
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,040
get to

1199
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,599
so right now i know i told you guys i i

1200
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,880
would check the questions so

1201
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
i will open up the floor and let me look

1202
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,118
at chat

1203
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
all right thank you phil do you have

1204
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
access to the chat screen all together

1205
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,680
do you want to run through them one at a

1206
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,960
time or do you want me to

1207
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
uh read them off i mean if you have

1208
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
anything i i know there might be some

1209
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,240
just conversation back and forth in here

1210
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,920
but if you saw any any good

1211
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,400
almost all of its questions oh perfect

1212
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,960
for the

1213
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,520
room uh you guys have the ability to

1214
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
unmute yourselves

1215
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,359
so um happy to have you guys type in the

1216
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,640
chat ask a question

1217
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,520
um or you can unmute yourself ask a

1218
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,160
question

1219
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,800
or you can raise your hand and i will

1220
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
magically unmute you or something i'm

1221
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
not sure but go ahead phil

1222
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,079
yeah okay so let me go through some of

1223
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,079
these questions again i do want to say

1224
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,200
some of these are pretty technical

1225
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
questions i am a hobbyist i probably

1226
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,319
won't be able to answer a lot of these

1227
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,800
these are good questions that i um

1228
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
uh need to read up a little bit more on

1229
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
but i'll do my best

1230
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,839
so the first question is can you explain

1231
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,520
how phase would be measured

1232
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,000
um this i believe is done through in

1233
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,839
phase and quadrature this is um

1234
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,000
in the modulation section i touched just

1235
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,440
briefly on

1236
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,560
um what i wasn't going to be talking

1237
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,440
about

1238
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
in phase and quadrature is a way of

1239
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,200
analyzing signatures that helps

1240
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,960
for one thing identify phase of the

1241
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,720
signal

1242
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,560
um let me see general rule of thumb

1243
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
someone brought up the norquest sampling

1244
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,040
rate it's a basic idea in digital signal

1245
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,000
processing again

1246
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,720
i am not knowledgeable enough to give a

1247
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,400
good explanation of that here

1248
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,480
so i would recommend uh they they cover

1249
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,520
it in both the

1250
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,400
uh the volume that i covered as well as

1251
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,680
michael osmond's um

1252
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
video series or just go on the wikipedia

1253
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,520
page it's it's interesting but

1254
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,400
that uh nyquist sampling rate um and the

1255
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
criteria is a very fundamental theory

1256
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,160
behind this

1257
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,400
yep look look up my question channeling

1258
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,839
sampling theory yup absolutely

1259
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,480
what the band and sdr can receive um it

1260
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
depends on what sdr you're talking about

1261
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
they have different ranges

1262
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,440
um i would recommend you you look at my

1263
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,720
talk on uh

1264
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
you know introduction to sdr i cover

1265
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,760
some of the major

1266
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,040
software defined radios are out there

1267
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,240
and the frequencies are out there and

1268
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,599
the capabilities

1269
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,800
so i'd put you in that direction um

1270
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,960
the the quick answer is it's typically

1271
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
in the low megahertz to about

1272
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,880
two and a half you know the two and a

1273
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,000
half five gigahertz

1274
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,520
range so like you know ham radio

1275
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,839
up to to wi-fi is the range you'll

1276
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,960
typically see

1277
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,119
yep hack graph goes about to get yep

1278
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,599
so can you pick up radio cellular and

1279
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,800
wi-fi

1280
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,520
um in terms of frequencies yes you want

1281
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
to visualize it go right ahead

1282
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,760
demodulate and demodulating it is a

1283
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,920
totally different ballgame

1284
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
when it comes to radio for example

1285
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,960
you're talking about the bandwidth

1286
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,480
you're covering you start to get into

1287
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,040
you know

1288
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,160
limitations of the the hardware um

1289
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
it's much more difficult to do that with

1290
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
general purpose hardware like a hack rf

1291
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,599
you're much better off doing it with

1292
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,200
specialized hardware

1293
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,440
um so while you can demodulate wi-fi

1294
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,400
with a hack rf

1295
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,920
just get like a an alpha yeah right

1296
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,319
don't do it by yourself um even

1297
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,240
satellite yeah you can you can do it all

1298
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,599
it's all about um you know the

1299
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,839
implementation

1300
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,960
um heavily dependent on bit rate

1301
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,359
antennas yeah antennas and all of that

1302
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,359
are our completely different topic

1303
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,520
um that i certainly do not have the

1304
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,119
experience on

1305
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,119
but that's all implemented in hardware

1306
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,839
right

1307
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,200
um and that's how did you learn all the

1308
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,720
blogs pointers and resources

1309
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,880
yes how did i learn it uh the two main

1310
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,000
resources and i will go

1311
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,960
back up here to the uh in the agenda

1312
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
page to show you guys

1313
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,480
um right here

1314
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,079
these are the two major resources i use

1315
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,240
for these talks field expedient sdr

1316
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,839
uh it's a three volume series i believe

1317
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,000
each one is about 20 bucks on amazon

1318
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
um the the the web page that he has with

1319
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,680
all the demos completely free so you can

1320
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,040
download the demos and play around with

1321
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,599
them on

1322
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,560
gnu radio today for absolutely free the

1323
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,079
other resources i'll point you to

1324
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,560
michael osmond the maker of hack rf has

1325
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,599
a really good

1326
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,960
um 11 part sdr series where he goes

1327
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,359
through

1328
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,240
in gnu radio covers all of the topics we

1329
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,680
talked about today

answer they're more professional i'm

1372
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,200

thank you awesome yeah so um

1376
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,720
you know rod asked me to give a talk on

1377
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,079
malware information sharing

1378
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,640
platform it's a platform that was

1379
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,560
developed i think by nato

1380
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,599
and the luxembourg cert and the

1381
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,359
belgium area sort of eu financing

1382
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,079
uh sort of industry they needed a way to

1383
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:00,720
collect

1384
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,160
uh information and and uh indicators of

1385
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,880
compromise

1386
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,119
for different campaigns and malware and

1387
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,160
things they were dealing with and

1388
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,280
different threat actors that were

1389
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,160
targeting them

1390
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,680
so they built a database to do that

1391
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,760
so i started using this when i was a

1392
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,119
threat researcher at

1393
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,760
a endpoint company to categorize the

1394
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,960
malware

1395
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,560
because we would get new malware samples

1396
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,920
every day and if we knew that they were

1397
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,720
phoning home

1398
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,079
to a known call home or a domain name or

1399
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,680
they were using some sort of a registry

1400
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,440
key or tactic that we could identify

1401
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,400
and store in a database like this uh it

1402
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,000
would be a great way to kind of help

1403
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,960
quickly

1404
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,800
sort of prioritize and route what kind

1405
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,240
of malware something was

1406
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,280
and also you know train um the malware

1407
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,400
engines and the

1408
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,160
signatures involved and stuff like that

1409
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,440
so that's really

1410
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
how i got into this platform kind of

1411
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,119
built it and stood it up for my team to

1412
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,000
be able to

1413
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,359
quickly identify uh malware so i'm just

1414
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,280
going to go over the basics obviously uh

1415
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,800
what an indicator is most of you

1416
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,560
probably heard of ip addresses domain

1417
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,119
names

1418
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,040
and hashes of you know one-way

1419
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,720
cryptographic hash of a

1420
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,880
file it's like a fingerprint but there's

1421
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,560
also things in there like the aba

1422
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,960
routing number for a financial scam or

1423
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,960
about a bitcoin wallet for a ransomware

1424
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,440
or

1425
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,119
who is registering for a domain name can

1426
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,640
sometimes give a clue

1427
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,800
to a campaign being related to another

1428
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,680
one

1429
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,880
so these are all things that we kind of

1430
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,400
want to collect and there's way more

1431
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,599
than that but these are just some

1432
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,880
examples

1433
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,040
um and you know the other question

1434
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,319
people might have is well why do we

1435
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,079
collect these things and and i put some

1436
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,280
examples here

1437
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,240
um like i said in europe there was a an

1438
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,359
industry isac

1439
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,319
sharing information uh that they wanted

1440
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,599
to say you know if these guys are

1441
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,040
targeting all the banks we want to know

1442
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,119
about them and share that information so

1443
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,800
we kind of have more of an immune system

1444
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,200
around our banking uh here in europe or

1445
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,319
something like that

1446
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,480
um you know tracking a malware campaign

1447
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,440
as a researcher

1448
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,000
is the use i used for it but we've also

1449
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,800
seen people

1450
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,559
automating and validating and enriching

1451
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,000
their sim content

1452
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,520
they might have written signatures or

1453
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,760
gotten vendor information or logs in

1454
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,079
and they can compare it to known bad

1455
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:04,960
activity

1456
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,359
and maybe enrich the data by giving you

1457
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,640
context around

1458
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,559
yes the signature fire and it's it's

1459
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,480
going to a known you know

1460
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,040
bad address or something like that or

1461
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,640
just maybe if the sim content is not

1462
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,079
working and you see something

1463
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,760
you can investigate and find out and fix

1464
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,359
it so it gives you some sort of

1465
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,160
operational

1466
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,760
validation that things are working the

1467
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,839
way you intend um it also

1468
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,119
gives you a way to communicate with

1469
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,880
vendors uh without

1470
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,920
you know giving them too much

1471
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,440
information so we've seen a lot of

1472
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,200
people say hey you didn't catch this to

1473
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,079
their vendor

1474
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,760
they provide some information some

1475
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
domain names some ip addresses

1476
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,800
then they're able to improve the

1477
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,400
products and

1478
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,079
you know everyone benefits from that as

1479
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,160
well and another thing is

1480
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,680
historical searching and review of data

1481
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,599
once you do have a identified threat

1482
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,240
actor

1483
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,680
you can go back into your data and

1484
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,359
figure out maybe the dwell time

1485
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,559
which is how long have they been

1486
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,640
operating in my network uh

1487
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,800
and that way you know how much damage or

1488
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,240
how many

1489
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,680
footholds they might have established in

1490
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,839
your network and again

1491
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,599
automation is the last thing it's a big

1492
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,040
piece of where we're going in this next

1493
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,760
decade

1494
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,720
we all need to you know learn our python

1495
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,359
and our

1496
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,839
automation tools to uh to kind of make

1497
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,160
the easy stuff happen a little faster

1498
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
so having data around that makes our our

1499
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,200
scripting more intelligent

1500
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,680
uh so use cases for miss we've kind of

1501
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,920
touched on that in the last slide too

1502
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,880
um but here's here's some more use cases

1503
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,599
um

1504
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,880
but for me it was about collaborating

1505
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,720
with the team number five you know

1506
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,599
um searching and seeing that this

1507
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,119
malware is doing this that this other

1508
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,720
malware did kind of tells you right away

1509
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,839
that it's related

1510
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,480
um you know unless it's just a commonly

1511
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,680
compromised

1512
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,240
uh public host that is being passed

1513
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,319
around by different threat groups but

1514
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,599
you know that can happen as well but

1515
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,280
it's just a it's a quick way to identify

1516
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,000
things and

1517
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,440
and collaborate with your team when you

1518
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,079
when you have a lot of data to process

1519
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,839
um and then the first the first thing

1520
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,000
too is is this product has a uh

1521
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,920
it's not a product it's open source but

1522
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,240
this this platform has

1523
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,440
a way to search from you know your sim

1524
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,000
or from

1525
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,800
uh slack or discord so one of the things

1526
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,680
we did

1527
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,000
on our discord was we made it just like

1528
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,520
a quick way to search

1529
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,200
where we could search for a hash for

1530
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,720
here for instance and get a

1531
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,960
get an example back uh or you could

1532
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,319
search for a domain name

1533
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,720
and get several examples back or you

1534
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,359
know uh

1535
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,040
even a thread actor name and like

1536
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
lazarus which is tied to

1537
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,839
a specific nation-state actor um so it's

1538
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,359
just kind of a way for your analyst to

1539
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,880
be able to quickly query it without

1540
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,720
jumping and logging in and doing a bunch

1541
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,680
of work

1542
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,359
uh just you know having those things

1543
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,400
available so

1544
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,920
um the main the main thing is getting

1545
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,440
data into the platform

1546
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,119
uh so some of the sources for data we

1547
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,880
have vendor blogs like

1548
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,359
um you know palo alto cisco talos

1549
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,119
and you have the online threat exchanges

1550
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,119
from ibm alienvault uh

1551
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480
threatconnect um there's there's so many

1552
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
sources but there's also feeds inside of

1553
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,839
this platform as well

1554
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,880
so you can turn on the feed from the

1555
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,839
luxembourg cert circle you can turn on

1556
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,200
all sorts of feeds from

1557
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,480
the swisscert abuse.ch uh you can bring

1558
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,400
in even a tour node list or

1559
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,680
or something like that so you can be

1560
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,359
aware of that type of activity if it's

1561
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,200
if it's in your threat profile

1562
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,240
be to do that type of work and

1563
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,520
so this this is kind of just uh

1564
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,440
some of the sources for the data but

1565
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,800
really the most important sources are

1566
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,240
going to come from your reverse

1567
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,520
engineers on your

1568
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,040
your company staff or something like

1569
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,200
that to find you know the threat actors

1570
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,720
that are specifically targeting you

1571
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,280
and having a place to put that data so

1572
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,119
that's going to be kind of the

1573
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,160
most important data

1574
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,240
so here's an example too of once we get

1575
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,599
a bunch of data in

1576
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,520
some of the correlation we can see from

1577
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,040
the data so we see here a bunch of

1578
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,720
hashes and domain names

1579
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,800
and how they're related so here we have

1580
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,559
a palo alto

1581
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,400
blog entry called the gorgon group

1582
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,760
nation state actor

1583
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,280
and we can see here that they have the

1584
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,960
same ip address that was related to

1585
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,440
another

1586
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,839
one of their blog posts called subot and

1587
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,000
we can also see that a microsoft hawkeye

1588
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,280
keylogger article

1589
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,960
shared a lot of indicators with it as

1590
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,200
well so we can start to see

1591
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,680
um even cisco talos had chimed in that

1592
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,440
there was a threat roundup in august

1593
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,480
that mentioned one of the

1594
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,200
uh hashes involved so it kind of gives

1595
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,280
you a unique view of

1596
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
what different threat actors are being

1597
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,040
reported and how and what the different

1598
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,880
names are which has kind of been

1599
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,079
a bit of an issue in the industry

1600
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,119
because

1601
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,359
you have fire i might call it apt and

1602
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,640
then a number

1603
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,720
and then you have crowdstrike might call

1604
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,559
it bear fancy bear or something like

1605
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,359
that

1606
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,280
you have uh microsoft might call it

1607
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,720
strontium

1608
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
and then you know somebody else might

1609
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,800
call it spider or something like that

1610
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,720
uh so there's kind of a naming problem

1611
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,079
as well so this is something that we can

1612
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,680
talk about how to address that if that's

1613
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,119
of interest to people

1614
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,160
as well so uh just kind of having um not

1615
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,920
not to depend on your memory for all of

1616
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,920
these millions of indicators

1617
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,599
for how they relate to each other is a

1618
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,040
huge lift uh

1619
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,400
for stock analysts and threat

1620
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,319
intelligence folks that are doing work

1621
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,319
on this type of stuff

1622
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,079
so let's talk about also data

1623
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,000
enrichments right so we've taken the

1624
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,440
effort to put all this data into a

1625
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,079
database

1626
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
and and collect it um what what do we

1627
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,920
want to do with

1628
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,000
uh with the data so one of the things we

1629
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,839
can do is we can enrich the data

1630
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,920
by querying against you know different

1631
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,599
services as well

1632
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,839
not only can we get indicators from

1633
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,440
alienvault but if maybe they don't come

1634
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,559
from there we can check to see if

1635
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,000
they're in alienvault and get more

1636
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,960
indicators

1637
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,359
or another cool one is the um the risk

1638
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,960
iq passive total one

1639
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,880
if you have an ip address from a vendor

1640
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,720
that's bad and you don't know why it's

1641
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,359
bad

1642
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,079
well you might get a list of 30 domain

1643
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,760
names that are parked on that ip address

1644
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,920
and then be able to figure out more

1645
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,119
and go a little deeper with your

1646
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,559
investigation so these little things

1647
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,240
kind of help

1648
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,160
and even with showdown where it's more

1649
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,240
like well what services is this

1650
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,800
ip address hosting you can go and look

1651
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,160
and see that maybe

1652
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,200
it's hosting a webcam uh security camera

1653
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,400
and it got compromised or something

1654
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,200
along those lines

1655
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,319
you never know what you're going to run

1656
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,240
into but having these extra tools to

1657
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,160
query and bring in data with

1658
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,079
is really helpful and lastly

1659
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,359
uh we have here is the mis is part of an

1660
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,880
ecosystem called the hive

1661
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,240
and the cortex uh ecosystem and then

1662
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,319
maltigo is a visualization tool that

1663
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,000
takes the relationships a bit further

1664
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,920
than what's built into the tool

1665
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,720
um so you can actually have a security

1666
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,000
incident response platform that

1667
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,280
integrates with this

1668
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,119
you can have um malware samples actually

1669
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,520
available and uploaded through miss and

1670
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,200
through these platforms as well

1671
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,720
so you have access to them if you want

1672
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,400
to reverse engineer them

1673
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,680
so there's all sorts of stuff that you

1674
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,520
can bolt on to this it's really just a

1675
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,119
starting point

1676
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,040
and for me it was just about collecting

1677
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,640
the data and taking a look to see if it

1678
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,160
was worth collecting

1679
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,400
but also another thing i think is very

1680
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,160
important is

1681
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,720
the data when it's published could

1682
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,359
change

1683
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,160
down the road um so having the data as

1684
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,000
it was as it was published to me is very

1685
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,880
important

1686
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,280
um as as stories change as narratives

1687
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,920
change as

1688
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
as nation states get involved in cyber

1689
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,040
uh

1690
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,400
and cyber war considerations having a

1691
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,920
point of reference is is really

1692
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,440
interesting to me so

1693
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,559
um that's another reason so um any

1694
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,839
questions about

1695
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,559
um the platform so far or anything like

1696
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,160
that before we jump into a working

1697
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,839
platform to show you what it does

1698
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,319
all right so again misp is available at

1699
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,040
github

1700
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,200
the hive is available here the project

1701
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,280
and

1702
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,960
iproject.org and misproject.org there's

1703
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,680
tons of

1704
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,799
information there about the platform so

1705
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,720
this is my personal server that i've set

1706
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,799
up and i've pumped data into about

1707
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,000
five years worth and uh the crowds

1708
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,040
asking for the demo

1709
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,400
so um so this is uh basically the

1710
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,599
the event list when you log in

1711
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,280
uh so some of the stuff that i think is

1712
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,799
really cool is um

1713
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,480
you can see here how many attributes or

1714
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,480
indicators are in each

1715
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,599
um event and you can see how many

1716
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,119
different things it correlates with as

1717
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,079
well so

1718
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,839
you can see that it's related to 12

1719
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,400
other things that are in the system

1720
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,040
and that's pretty cool for for learning

1721
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,160
about stuff so

1722
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,400
let's go take a look at um actually

1723
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,920
let's do start with emote

1724
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,760
so this is a very common mass mailer

1725
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,680
that we see week after week it's pretty

1726
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,640
relentless

1727
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,200
it tends to bundle with trick bot um so

1728
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,799
what we can do here is we can actually

1729
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,599
tag this

1730
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,119
and say um that it's a mass mailer

1731
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,480
or maybe trickbot you know it's related

1732
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,920
to trickbot or something like that so

1733
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,680
there's a tagging functionality here

1734
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,240
but there's also a galaxy functionality

1735
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,359
where we can say

1736
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,440
um you know this is emote

1737
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,200
and it'll tell you that it's related to

1738
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,280
the giotto

1739
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
uh family as well so it's already

1740
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,720
able to give you context about some of

1741
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,000
the malware families and

1742
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,680
and the types of stuff they're looking

1743
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,040
for um

1744
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,359
and from there you can actually look i

1745
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,000
think um

1746
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,760
one of these guys tells you a lot of

1747
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,200
information yeah so

1748
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,720
uh this is this is taking you into the

1749
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,880
galaxy's piece of the platform

1750
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,559
we can see here a bunch of article

1751
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,480
references about this malware if you

1752
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,240
wanted to learn more about it

1753
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,880
um so so having that sort of galaxy that

1754
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,640
ties together all the thread actors all

1755
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,520
the names

1756
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,960
all the terminology and and lingo

1757
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,200
uh really helps uh get up to speed on

1758
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,799
some of these things very quickly

1759
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,960
so down here how we enter these

1760
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,880
indicators is you can click here and use

1761
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,400
a free text import tool

1762
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,799
and just paste a ton of iocs from maybe

1763
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,480
pastebin or from a vendor blog or

1764
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,599
something like that

1765
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,200
and you hit submit and then you can add

1766
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,799
a comment to each one

1767
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,720
so i can see here that this ip address

1768
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
was added and it came from

1769
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,280
its emote working group cryptolemus uh

1770
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,040
his twitter account or their twitter

1771
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,000
account

1772
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and and so we have a frame of reference

1773
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
for when you know where it came from and

1774
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,079
when it was added to the system

1775
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,680
and you can also see the events it's

1776
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,520
related to here in red

1777
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,440
uh so when we do want to take a look at

1778
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,880
all the different things that it's

1779
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,000
related to

1780
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,359
for instance here's that trickbot

1781
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,000
relationship i mentioned um

1782
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,240
you can just click here on correlation

1783
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,000
graph and you'll get like a

1784
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,480
bunch of relationships here so we can

1785
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,000
see in july

1786
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,040
of you know this year of of uh

1787
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,240
probably 2018 here let me see here

1788
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,480
yeah so there was a drydex campaign that

1789
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,040
they were delivering malware for drydex

1790
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,880
as well with emoted

1791
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,200
and you can see in november this these

1792
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,559
ips were used

1793
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,440
you can see over time that it's using

1794
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,200
some of the same infrastructure from

1795
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,839
week to week month to month year to year

1796
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,440
and and see that even though they're not

1797
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,040
changing much they're still getting away

1798
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,119
with and delivering different malware

1799
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,880
so what we what we've termed this is

1800
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,520
kind of as access as a service or

1801
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,000
um yeah you know compromise as a service

1802
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,359
where they're bringing in

1803
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,640
whatever dridex or or tripod or whoever

1804
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,559
wants to pay them to get access

1805
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,760
because they're very efficient at

1806
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,839
delivering those payloads even with the

1807
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,160
same ip addresses month over month

1808
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,319
um so yeah any questions about this

1809
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,240
visualization or what we can do

1810
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,440
uh with this data

1811
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,280
does this seem interesting to anybody at

1812
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,040
all would this help you in your security

1813
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,599
operations

1814
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,359
yeah everything looks good um the the

1815
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,040
more i'm seeing the presentation

1816
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,079
um i'm wondering whether there's an

1817
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,160
integration with security onion where

1818
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,440
you can actually take those p

1819
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,720
caps um or does

1820
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,280
is this more of a replacement to

1821
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,319
something like that

1822
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,599
or to that type of platform

1823
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,280
um that's a good question i haven't

1824
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,640
actually used that

1825
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,960
security onion there might be an

1826
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,720
integration here where you can go in and

1827
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,839
add an api key

1828
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,400
okay cool yeah and and if they if

1829
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,160
security onion has an api

1830
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,280
that's a great way to uh to do that um

1831
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,680
and also tom hacks is mentioning uh the

1832
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,160
export functionality too

1833
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,799
so anything any data that's in here can

1834
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,480
be exported to snort or bro

1835
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,920
or circada you can do this on an event

1836
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,480
level or you can

1837
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,480
do this on the whole server level um so

1838
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,079
that way you're able to uh

1839
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,319
even yara as well store data in here

1840
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,839
that can be used by other systems and

1841
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:48,799
export it so

1842
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,960
uh since this is an open source project

1843
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,559
again i'm not familiar with security

1844
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,799
onion but maybe you could make an export

1845
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,559
sort of function here to bring this data

1846
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,400
in uh to them

1847
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,319
and and also automate using their api

1848
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,720
um all sorts of stuff that you can send

1849
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,240
and receive through the api

1850
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,920
with other products so so like i said in

1851
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,680
the presentation there's a ton of

1852
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,040
products they integrate with

1853
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,720
i haven't even gotten through them but i

1854
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,640
think there's over 150 entries

1855
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,760
in the in the import export sort of

1856
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,440
area alone of this platform

1857
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,799
yeah thanks um as far as the discord bot

1858
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,480
goes i don't have discord bot

1859
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,760
on this machine but um

1860
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,680
we we just built it to query the search

1861
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,960
all handler

1862
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,440
in here and what it allows you know

1863
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,880
allows your analysts to do is they're

1864
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,480
seeing a weird domain name they've never

1865
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,520
seen before

1866
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,799
or they're seeing a weird um you know ip

1867
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:45,760
address they can

1868
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,680
search really quickly and get a result

1869
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,839
back a hash or something like that

1870
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,760
they can also do that against virustotal

1871
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,839
or any other service as well

1872
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,359
so you can we're going to start to see

1873
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,760
more slackbot functions and discord bot

1874
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,119
functions like that

1875
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,440
um as we go where you know we'll be able

1876
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,839
to query a bunch of services at once and

1877
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,599
i think misp is a pretty cool one to add

1878
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,599
to that especially in a corporate

1879
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,240
setting

1880
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,920
if you don't already have some internal

1881
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,760
tools that are well integrated

1882
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,359
it's a great thing they can just drop in

1883
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,720
and integrate pretty easily

1884
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,559
all right um so yeah are there any

1885
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,160
threat actors or campaigns you guys

1886
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,680
would be interested in searching for in

1887
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,200
here that uh

1888
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,000
that would be um interesting to anybody

1889
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,319
like

1890
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,640
uh the gorgon group was one

1891
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,960
too as we can do can we take two or more

1892
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,240
missed deployments and connect them to

1893
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,119
share data

1894
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,880
yes there's actually a sync action here

1895
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,480
where you can have servers

1896
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,119
that share data directly and you can

1897
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,880
also set the publishing level and the

1898
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,240
distribution level

1899
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,038
of each article

1900
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,039
uh does it do ja3 hashing i have not

1901
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,319
heard of that let's check

1902
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,760
um so when we add an indicator down here

1903
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,119
we can just add a single indicator i

1904
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,119
think it'll give us a list

1905
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,520
and there's md5 shot one

1906
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,599
shock 256 j3 fingerprint md5 is that

1907
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,720
what you're looking for cisco

1908
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,200
all right so we do have that in here um

1909
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,520
there's also that

1910
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,280
there's also the other one that i can't

1911
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,039
think of right now like ssd or something

1912
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:23,920
like that

1913
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,319
is in here as well you can manage

1914
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,119
instances

1915
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,440
or yep yeah so you can you can have um

1916
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,280
like an isac that has everybody's

1917
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,480
connected below it

1918
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,079
and that way you don't send your data up

1919
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,000
to the isac until you publish it

1920
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,640
um and uh they can send all their data

1921
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,160
that they publish to you guys

1922
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,839
so you can have an ecosystem of these

1923
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,839
servers where uh you're sharing the data

1924
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,200
you want to share and publishing what

1925
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,400
you want to share

1926
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,599
and there um the way the

1927
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,760
the servers go is there's like yeah

1928
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,039
there's like these communities here

1929
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,839
let's see

1930
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,839
um

1931
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,839
yeah so you can have locally published

1932
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,960
you can have it published to your

1933
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,760
community

1934
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,200
or you can have it published globally so

1935
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,720
there's multiple levels that's what i'm

1936
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,760
trying to say

1937
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,079
uh for where you can have data go and

1938
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,200
filter up

1939
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,119
and you don't have you can have this

1940
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,960
stuff here you know published globally

1941
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,000
but if you're not connected to anybody

1942
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,359
it won't go anywhere

1943
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,759
um it just stays on the system

1944
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,359
cool good questions guys um so the other

1945
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:28,720
one i wanted to talk about was the

1946
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,839
gorgon group

1947
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,440
um the one that i showed you where we

1948
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,039
had a palo alto

1949
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,520
uh release but that it it was also

1950
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,119
mentioning a hawkeye keylogger and it

1951
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,559
was also mentioning subot

1952
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,839
and you know mentioning in cisco chalice

1953
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:42,720
as well

1954
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,799
um so we can see here when we when we

1955
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,480
entered when i entered this data i saw

1956
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,240
immediately those relationships pop

1957
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,359
up here and um you know we're able to

1958
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,559
look at that

1959
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,960
and see here that it's related to

1960
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,640
hawkeye keylogger and

1961
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,839
when i read the gorgon group uh blog

1962
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,599
publication i didn't see him mention

1963
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:02,799
that at all and i thought that was kind

1964
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,480
of weird that they left that out

1965
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,839
so if you're even a researcher

1966
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,440
at one of these kind of elite threat

1967
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,280
intelligence units you should dump your

1968
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,720
indicators into one of these things and

1969
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,920
make sure you're not missing a

1970
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,280
connection here

1971
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,119
is kind of what we see and so what we

1972
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,640
ended up doing was

1973
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,280
we would um we would tweet at the

1974
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,000
researchers

1975
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,160
from you know unit 42 at palo alto and

1976
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,200
say hey

1977
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,480
you know there's a connection here with

1978
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,319
this article and send them the link to

1979
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,960
this

1980
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,400
microsoft hawkeye keylogger article here

1981
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,200
um that james in the box tweeted out and

1982
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,799
i think there was an actual microsoft

1983
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,680
yeah

1984
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,160
uh article here so yeah it was kind of

1985
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,599
interesting

1986
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,520
uh to be able to participate in that way

1987
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,280
with the researchers and show them those

1988
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,799
extra relationships

1989
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,200
so we take a ja3 hash collected and

1990
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,480
query it

1991
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,640
and get the os browser that made the

1992
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,079
request

1993
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,640
even if it's trying to obfuscate okay

1994
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,119
yeah yeah so for example when um

1995
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,839
you make a ssl tls connection to a

1996
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:02,640
server

1997
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,520
uh you can uh get that fingerprint um

1998
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,680
before it encrypts the connection

1999
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,960
and because hashing it with ja3

2000
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,839
right if you're collecting those um

2001
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:14,880
those fingerprints

2002
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,920
um yeah and and we've uh this is an open

2003
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,520
source project as well

2004
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,799
uh using a rainbow table for it

2005
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,559
well um um they already have uh uh

2006
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,280
in their database so if for example um

2007
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,119
somebody's hitting you with metasploit

2008
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,240
but they're saying no i'm firefox um uh

2009
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,400
because we already have the fingerprint

2010
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,839
fingerprint for metasploit

2011
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,520
we already know yeah no you're lying to

2012
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,359
us this is an actual attack

2013
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,119
that's pretty useful yeah i hadn't run

2014
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,839
into that yet i like

2015
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,160
all right so uh if anybody has any

2016
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,760
questions we can keep going and digging

2017
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,960
into the platform but i really just

2018
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,720
wanted to share it with you guys

2019
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,760
and let you know on discord uh if you

2020

2025
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,400
you guys want access

2026
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
to read only to be able to query this or

2027
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,079
if you want to contribute and want to

2028
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,520
talk to me about this

2029
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,359
feel free to reach out we can we can

2030
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,119
always use more folks adding data to

2031
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,760
this

2032
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,599
uh like i said a lot of it does come in

2033
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:20,880
automated but

2034
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,160
i do still add manually a lot of blogs

2035
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,160
and stuff like that just to make sure

2036
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,319
we have a good coverage of data so this

2037
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,400
could we can also make a separate

2038
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
organization within my server for hack

2039
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,119
miami

2040
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,960
uh so you guys can have your own working

2041
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,799
group and and be able to take all the

2042
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,000
data that's in here

2043
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,160
plus whatever you guys want to publish

2044
