00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
be why we checked that right so

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,920
uh let me just move things over uh

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,759

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,480
all right here we go so

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,280
my name is christopher lopez and today

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,800
i'm going to be talking about

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
asking questions and a little bit of

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
this presentation is going to be

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
about writing effectively so

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,760
we're going to talk about thinking about

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,159
how

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,119
you think in this presentation i spend

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,080
probably

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,159
too much time thinking about how

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,439
investigations work

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,360
than actually doing investigations

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
sometimes i'll be honest it happens

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,759
um and there's something that really

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
you know made me interested in this and

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
that was that when i started in cyber

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
security

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,159
i was not technical at all it was very

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,119
difficult for me to like gain a bunch of

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:31,920
information

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
uh very quickly when i joined the sock

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
so when you join a sock for those that

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
haven't or those that have you know been

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
at a talk

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
um you are forced to deal with the water

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,159
holes effect of hey this is just how

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,119
things are

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,920
start learning so the only thing that

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
kept me afloat

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
was the fact that i somehow

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
figured out a way of asking questions

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
effectively

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
um so i spent and i mean uh it got to

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,799
the point that many of my

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,840
um coworkers would be like probably

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
tired of all the questions that i would

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,318
ask but

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,399
now i look for that in people that i

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,400
train or anyone that i speak to in the

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
field

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
because this is definitely um one of the

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
biggest things that can help

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,520
anyone become better as an analyst so

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,720
let's kind of just run into this so who

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,360
am i

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
uh number one as always i'm a father

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,520
first

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
and of course i am a stock analyst i've

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
been a stock analyst for some time

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,319
different companies and i spend most of

66
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,080
my time you know of course on the blue

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
side of things

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
as an investigator and my superpower i

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
guess we can call it that

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
is i'm always asking questions so

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,080
let's talk about what we're here to

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
discuss

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
so today's agenda we're going to talk

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,200
about the investigative process

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
and it's funny you're going to notice

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
that these are questions that

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,280
you know we see often in other things in

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,080
our lives

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,720
i think this applies to just about every

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,239
facet of our lives but

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,400
in the context of investigating they're

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
incredibly powerful

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
and they guide your entire investigation

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
and then of course at the end we're

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,640
gonna

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,800
talk about a little write-up example and

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
probably give some more examples that

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,800
i've

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
had to uh investigate so

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
what do you need to be an incredible

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
investigator

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
not much all you need is your mind right

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,519
and

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,640
your mind we're gonna encapsulize your

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
questions your biases we'll talk a

96
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
little bit about biases

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
uh your perspective and of course you're

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
gonna bring in your experiences that's

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,000
just

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
the way that we are right uh so the next

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,239
thing you need is you need to be able to

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,040
take notes

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
uh doesn't matter how you do it um you

104
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
know while you're going through an

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,599
investigation

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,480
i've seen some people that are very

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
effective

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
at typing incredibly fast i wish that i

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,519
was that fast at

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
i usually stick to a one of these

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
notepad and uh pen and

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
go from there and of course you need to

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
have some kind of a

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
loosely defined process to be a great

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,000
investigator

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
and why am i emphasizing loosely well

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,040
because

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
i feel that when we're talking about

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,199
investigation

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,080
if you have a very strict process uh

121
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
i'll give you an example like ir

122
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
right incident responsive it's very

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
strict and it's very

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
you have to be by the books what i've

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,479
seen is that actually

126
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,880
remove some of the creativity and some

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,840
of the you know

128
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
thoughts that an analyst would have that

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
can guide an investigation and lead to a

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,320
pivot

131
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
that you know may reveal information

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,919
that's very important for an

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,040
investigation so

134
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
i try to leave it at a loosely defined

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,479
and of course

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,360
um you know in a team setting your team

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
members

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
definitely try to lean on them as you

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
learn to become a better investigator

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
i mean i probably leaned on people too

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
much but here we are

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
and we're talking about investigating

143
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
now so i think it works

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,520
so the investigative engine

145
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
so this is just a quick i guess you can

146
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
call this a graph

147
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
of what i see as you know

148
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
what an investigation is right so it

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,479
starts out with

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
questions right we're gonna keep you're

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
gonna hear the word questions a lot

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
that's just part of the presentation

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
and uh artifact collection that is you

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,680
know evidence

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
right rabbit holes uh the reason i put

156
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
them here is because

157
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,960
that's very common in our field um i

158
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,919
i fall into rabbit holes every day um

159
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
it's just part of it

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
uh it's just with time you gain the

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
ability of learning how to get out of

162
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,000
retirement

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
at the right time and still i i you know

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,840
i sometimes end up spending hours in a

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,639
rabbit hole and

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
i need somebody to pull me out but it's

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,880
it's fine uh so after you

168
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
collect all the artifacts you go through

169
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
a bunch of holes right

170
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
you then compile your findings this is

171
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,199
where you

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,520
put everything all into one pane and try

173
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,319
to

174
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
decide or try to form a conclusion as to

175
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,720
what happened

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
right because at the end of the day the

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
reason that analysts are

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,639
and valuable in the field is because

179
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,840
unlike a machine

180
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
you know we gather evidence and we

181
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
formulate our decision based on our

182
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
experiences our bias

183
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
everything that we covered in the

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
previous slide and then we form a

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,840
conclusion

186
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
and that usually leads to the last point

187
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,759
which is

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
documentation all right so you form a

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,880
conclusion

190
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,919
and then you need to compile a you know

191
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,960
a

192
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
paper or something to reflect

193
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,639
your investigation and again there's

194
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,080
going to be probably another point in

195
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
this presentation when i talk about how

196
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,280
invaluable that is

197
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,560
but an analyst is uh measured

198
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,120
by their ability to communicate what

199
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,000
they do

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
um that's something that i learned the

201
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,319
hard way

202
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
where i had to learn how to speak better

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
and write better

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
uh very quickly uh because yeah i may

205
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
understand this at a very technical

206
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,720
level

207
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
but how i communicate what occurred to

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,800
management or leadership is sometimes

209
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,919
much more valuable

210
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
than just understanding how something

211
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,039
works technically

212
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
because at the end of the day an analyst

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
is trying to relay information for

214
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
the decision makers to go ahead and you

215
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,240
know

216
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
make the decision that they need to make

217
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
based on that evidence so

218
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
that's the engine now we're going to

219
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,319
divide this up into the questions

220
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,240
right so these are the questions that i

221
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,639
try to ask myself

222
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,599
throughout the investigation sometimes

223
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,880
or at least when i first started

224
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,919
investigating

225
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
i would have a notepad and i would just

226
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,960
write these questions

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
out and ensure that i can always go back

228
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,400
and look

229
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
at these questions to make sure that i'm

230
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,840
in the right place because

231
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
i get lost you know there's so many

232
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
things that may be happening you're

233
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
pulling logs from this machine

234
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
you're looking at you know endpoint logs

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
you're looking at

236
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
network logs you're looking at

237
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
authentication logs and then you

238
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
figure out your just you know all this

239
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
information you have no idea where you

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,479
are

241
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,680
so just try to keep a a mental note if

242
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
anything of where you stand in the

243
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,080
investigation

244
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,360
so the what the what is why you're doing

245
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,039
this in the first place what happened

246
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
right so um let's say it can be

247
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
something if you're you know familiar in

248
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
a sock setting with like a ticketing

249
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,440
system

250
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
it can be a you know sim detection alert

251
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,199
uh it can be something on the news right

252
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,000
it can be uh you know we've seen a lot

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,719
of uh

254
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
interesting vulnerabilities in the last

255
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,159
uh weeks

256
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
uh so it could be something like that

257
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
hey we see that there is this you know

258
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,640
dns

259
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,919
issue um are we vulnerable to that

260
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,240
you know that can spark an investigation

261
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
to gain information about your

262
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,560
environment

263
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
to answer that question right of course

264
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,880
it can be a threat hunt idea you saw an

265
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
awesome presentation by somebody uh

266
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,240
about this

267
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
really cool you know hacker thing to do

268
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,240
something

269
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
you know arguably bad well let's see if

270
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
it works in our environment

271
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,160
that can lead to an investigation to see

272
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
if you've ever seen evidence like that

273
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,720
or

274
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
any kind of behavior like that of course

275
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
last but not least organizational

276
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,120
processes

277
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
things just change right so then you may

278
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,399
need to oh

279
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,080
so now we're we're doing this new cloud

280
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
thing right are we actually putting

281
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,200
multi-factor authentication

282
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
what does that look like what does it

283
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
not look like how do we

284
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
detect that what do we do that may lead

285
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,839
to an investigation to see

286
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
you know how much visibility you have

287
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
into that type of activity

288
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
but the what is basically what starts

289
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
the investigation

290
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
so let's move on to the next question

291
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,200
before that

292
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
i always forget this and this is exactly

293
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
why i have a slide for it always

294
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,880
remember

295
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,320
to question the alert first and this

296
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,839
slide is more geared towards the

297
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
what being a alert so this is something

298
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
that i had a

299
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
very difficult time um understanding and

300
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
i had to write it down

301
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
a lot to get it and that is you always

302
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,399
question

303
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,640
the alert first meaning you question

304
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,560
whether or not that alert makes sense

305
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,720
right before you start digging into

306
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
let's say the alert is

307
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,560
i don't know you see that a domain

308
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,519
administrator

309
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
uh i don't know created an account on

310
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,560
some

311
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
thing that should never have that happen

312
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,000
right well

313
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
you know so who created this uh

314
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,640
alert logic and what is this actually

315
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
trying to capture and how did this

316
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
happen

317
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,079
uh spend some time actually reviewing

318
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,279
the alert

319
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,680
to ensure that you're asking first and

320
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
foremost

321
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,360
does this alert make sense right um i

322
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,240
found myself

323
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
spending a lot of time going down a

324
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
rabbit hole to then come to the

325
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
conclusion that the

326
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,320
logic behind the alert uh was actually

327
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,800
not working properly and it led to you

328
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,079
know probably a few hours

329
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
of interesting uh investigations so

330
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
always question that initial alert now

331
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
let's move on to the next question

332
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
why so your hypothesis

333
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,079
this is incredibly important this

334
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
guides your entire investigation

335
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
because how you lean on the scale

336
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
right let's say that i see this alert

337
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
and it looks like a false positive

338
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
right off the bat that bias that i've

339
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
created

340
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,880
affects the way that i'm going to you

341
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
know obtain information i need to be

342
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,959
aware of that bias initially

343
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,320
but your why and your hypothesis are

344
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
what happened the moment that you

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
actually see the alert your initial

346
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
reaction your gut reaction to it

347
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
um so write it down

348
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
uh that's one of the first things that i

349
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
do again

350
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,600
it can be on paper uh it can be on your

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
ticketing system doesn't matter write it

352
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,959
down

353
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,480
because how you feel about the alert

354
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
or what your what is again is going to

355
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,079
drive

356
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,760
everything that you do from there um so

357
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,839
i just want to kind of touch on this a

358
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,760
little bit at the end here where

359
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,639
i make a question here of course this

360
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,079
sounds familiar

361
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,279
forming a hypothesis um and

362
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
a couple examples for alerts and

363
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
questions

364
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,240
right so these are alerts on the left

365
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
and then the questions that

366
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
um actually come from these alerts so an

367
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,200
av detection for a file and a domain

368
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
controller

369
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
right so a question that i would have

370
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
for myself was was the file

371
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,720
action deleted foreign left alone is

372
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,519
this you know

373
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,279
a legitimate bad file right because av

374
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,920
as we know um just like any tool can

375
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
fail us

376
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
uh you know we need to try to be as too

377
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
agnostic as possible

378
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,720
so file execution in an uncommon

379
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
directory now

380
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
we've probably seen this before i don't

381
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,519
know we can say probably like app.attemp

382
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
or something a temporary

383
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
cache file there's a weird file

384
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
execution

385
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,279
right so you know or it can be something

386
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,760
where

387
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
the file is trying to hide in a

388
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,160
legitimate uh you know directory like a

389
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
system 32 if we're talking about windows

390
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
or something like that so is this file

391
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
that's one of the first questions this

392
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
file attempting to hide

393
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
because that that raises the suspicion

394
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,839
and can raise the severity of what this

395
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,959
alert is

396
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
uh if you have to do any kind of

397
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
escalation or any ir

398
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
so another question of course is you

399
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
know emo this is a

400
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,519
alert email click event by user during

401
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,040
an active phishing campaign well if you

402
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
know there's an active phishing campaign

403
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,839
you receive an alert

404
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
oh there's a there's a couple questions

405
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,880
i just want to make sure i'm not missing

406
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
anything

407
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,760
one second okay awesome uh so

408
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
uh there's a phishing campaign going on

409
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,279
like for example i think emote

410
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,519
just came back uh what is it thursday or

411
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,440
friday uh so that's interesting

412
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
um and then you have alerts set up so

413
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
that you

414
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
are able to detect when someone may you

415
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,199
know click on a phishing

416
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,120
email right one of the first questions

417
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
that i would ask myself is did the

418
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,399
you know user actually submit

419
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,320
credentials and that guides my

420
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,040
investigation

421
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
why because then i'm going to collect

422
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,800
any you know data that i have that may

423
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
answer that question right any network

424
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,440
type logs

425
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,959
hopefully you have visibility or

426
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,800
hopefully you have a proxy i don't know

427
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
uh but you know some way to answer that

428
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,000
question

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
right so let's go to the next slide

430
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
so if you notice

431
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,279
this process is not new right i'm not

432
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,639
reinventing the wheel

433
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
anyone that's ever talked about like the

434
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
investigation process is not

435
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
you know reinventing anything or this is

436
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,240
not new

437
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
um this is all based on what we normally

438
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,160
do

439
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,360
right as a society uh and

440
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
when we try to be scientific right um so

441
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,040
it all aligns with or loosely aligns

442
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
with the scientific method right we have

443
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
an observation

444
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,320
question we form a hypothesis we

445
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,279
experiment

446
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,120
i would say experiment in this case

447
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
would be gathering

448
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,519
artifacts and gathering data uh you know

449
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,000
we

450
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
perform our analysis on that data and

451
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,440
then we you know

452
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
actually come up with a conclusion that

453
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
we communicate outbound

454
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
right so i this always makes me happy to

455
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,160
see

456
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,839
uh it makes me feel like you know what

457
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,279
it is that i'm doing on a daily basis

458
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,199
actually aligns with how things are

459
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,720
discovered in the world so

460
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
there goes that scientific method still

461
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,000
works

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
so the next question right so we've gone

463
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,160
through what

464
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
we've gone through why and we're going

465
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,839
to talk a little bit about when

466
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,320
when when is interesting um because

467
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
uh when can become very complicated it's

468
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,399
the first

469
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,600
little square saying here rounded square

470
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
that you see on the screen um does not

471
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,040
align between

472
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
all of your logs so time stamps

473
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,959
uh let me give you a little story here

474
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
so i was looking at something that

475
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,639
looked malicious a file

476
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,120
let's just stick with av for a second uh

477
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
why not

478
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,199
and i was looking in the sim

479
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,000
for evidence of execution right this was

480
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,959
a windows machine

481
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,839
so um you know sysmon related and trying

482
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,240
to see

483
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
any evidence of files being created from

484
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,440
this

485
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279
executable and um i was looking

486
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
and i couldn't find it and i just felt

487
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
like i was missing something and i

488
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,720
didn't understand what it was

489
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,279
and what it was was that i was looking

490
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,720
in a completely

491
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
wrong time because the alert on the

492
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
endpoint occurred across the world

493
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,680
in asia and i was looking at a sim

494
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,759
that was set up for eastern time and i

495
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
was off by maybe

496
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,680
12 hours or more uh so i spent about

497
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
two to three hours uh looking for

498
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,079
evidence of this file

499
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,480
and then you know i i went for a walk

500
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
because i didn't understand why i wasn't

501
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,919
you know seeing this and i started to

502
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
question whether or not i knew anything

503
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,640
of course and then i come back i look at

504
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
the alert i start all the way back at

505
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
the first thing with the what and i

506
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,280
notice that the alert

507
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,720
is for a machine that is not you know an

508
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,919
eastern time

509
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,199
so that was one of those ah okay

510
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,199
so of course that led to understanding

511
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
that when

512
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,840
is incredibly important to understand

513
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,440
and um the last point i'm gonna make

514
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
with this slide is uh

515
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,320
if you can if you're an analyst and

516
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,880
you're

517
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,039
dealing with having to correlate between

518
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
uh things that are happening all across

519
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,760
the world

520
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,320
for your company or anything like that

521
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
uh try to set everything into

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
utc uh you you'll save a lot of a lot of

523
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
unnecessary time just trying to dig into

524
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
time zone conversions and things like

525
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
that that are not fun

526
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,960
all right where

527
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,280
so this question sometimes is difficult

528
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
um this is more aligned with uh you know

529
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,160
this machine and where it's located but

530
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,120
now with

531
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,240
cloud technology that is getting

532
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
a little bit less um i don't know it's

533
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,280
it's not

534
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
something that you're questioning a lot

535
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
because

536
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
you know it's it's hosted on some cloud

537
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,840
service

538
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,720
so especially if it's like a server that

539
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
has an alert or something like that

540
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
um but of course we have users though

541
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
right a lot of people are working from

542
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
home and that also makes it a little bit

543
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,799
more difficult right

544
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,919
location of stuff it's not in a building

545
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,840
and this is when you know we hear this a

546
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
lot in our industry

547
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
this is when asset management comes into

548
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
play significantly

549
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
because answering the where um

550
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,559
has a lot to do with if this is a laptop

551
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,440
for example

552
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
um how you're going to get that data

553
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
depends on you know whether or not your

554
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
asset management

555
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
may have that data for your query um the

556
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,679
interesting thing about

557
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,400
where is that it sometimes is answered

558
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,880
by

559
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
the when um because you'll get a

560
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,559
for example the last time i was talking

561
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,360
about when

562
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,679
actually had a time zone associated to

563
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
it and that provided me the where

564
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,559
so sometimes the where is answered

565
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,600
inherently

566
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
uh when you actually answer the one

567
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
question i know i'm throwing around

568
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,360
those words a lot but

569
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
they're all w's so it's always

570
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
interesting all right

571
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,919
how so this to me

572
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,480
is besides the hypothesis uh which again

573
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,919
derives your entire

574
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,600
uh investigation your how is

575
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,320
you know how this happened um you know

576
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
how did this

577
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,559
whatever this may be get here and of

578
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
course um i'm gonna throw in av again

579
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,039
because i spent a lot of time on file

580
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
type detections

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
um you know how did this file get into

582
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,679
this machine

583
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,000
or how did this file communicate

584
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,720
outbound

585
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,520
when we don't allow for that or how did

586
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
we detect this

587
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,960
does this logic make sense and how does

588
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,159
this work uh

589
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,120
how does this work that is uh usually a

590
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,400
rabbit hole um

591
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,200
because as we all know tactics change

592
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,760
and

593
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,880
techniques are modified and

594
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,600
things are always evolving in our field

595
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,159
and

596
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,159
learning how everything works is

597
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,200
impossible

598
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
uh but we do our best with rabbit holes

599
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
so again the last one is very important

600
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,559
and is

601
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,039
how impactful is this the reason i put

602
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,320
that last is because

603
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
right here once you're at the how and

604
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,919
you're understanding what's going on

605
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,440
and you're trying to put all of this

606
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
together uh after you've answered most

607
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
of your questions

608
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
then you know if it is very bad or if

609
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,559
it's like a true

610
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,799
positive something needs to happen this

611
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,159
is usually when

612
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,960
you'll go through the policy of ir or

613
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
through you know escalation

614
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
you know depending on you know i spend

615
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,919
some time as a

616
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,799
level one analyst for example and at

617
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,480
this point if i saw that okay

618
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
i am at this point and this does not

619
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,720
look good whatever um you know it can be

620
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,559
this this is spreading that's we hope

621
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,840
that never happened something's

622
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,480
spreading

623
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,320
i need to speak to it l2 i need to speak

624
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
to a level two analyst um that is

625
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,600
answering the how can lead to that okay

626
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,240
this is

627
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,000
big impact i need to do something about

628
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,640
this so

629
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
we're gonna move into who just to you

630
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,919
know change gears a little bit

631
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,480
uh who uh attribution so we

632
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,760
who is hard um because

633
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,039
attribution to me is can be difficult

634
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,919
i mean we have so many uh spray and pray

635
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,919
methods out there that could look super

636
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,919
suspicious i mean if you

637
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,080
even take a gander at your firewall logs

638
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,679
for things that are happening and if

639
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
you're a large enough company

640
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
uh there's a lot of who uh there's a lot

641
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
of there's a lot of stuff

642
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
happening um and of course this brings

643
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
up you know the threat intelligence side

644
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,480
of things and if

645
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,840
you're at this point in the

646
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
investigation where

647
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,840
you know you've realized that this is a

648
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,880
known tactic

649
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
or a known technique through mitre of

650
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,559
course and

651
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,080
you are able to attempt to attribute

652
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,799
this activity to a group or something

653
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,919
like that that's where threat

654
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,760
intelligence comes in

655
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,360
attribution to me has always been very

656
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,039
difficult um

657
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
because of course we have you know the

658
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
ability to copy techniques and

659
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
tactics and you know we i can make

660
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,880
myself look like somebody else

661
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,080
i can spoof this you know so who is hard

662
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
um but who is interesting when it comes

663
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
to answering this question

664
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,720
right is this an inside threat or an

665
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,679
outside threat

666
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,960
right um you know we hear about insider

667
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,679
threat

668
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,840
often in our industry and that's one of

669
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,440
the most difficult things to kind of

670
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,480
iron out

671
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
um because uh you know you there's like

672
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,559
an inherent trust

673
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,520
almost with your co-workers and things

674
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
like that so it's sometimes hard to

675
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
you know think that they can be doing

676
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,720
something malicious

677
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
uh but of course trying to you know

678
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,880
iron out or answer the who uh whether or

679
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,280
not

680
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
it is an insider outsider drives your

681
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,200
investigation

682
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
more depending on the data that you

683
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,559
receive

684
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,760
so um the who the last point uh with the

685
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,480
employee

686
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,640
vendor co-worker that's just if you do

687
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
find out that it is

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
you know not malicious right you know

689
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
who was affected by this

690
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
let's say that it's a file that you know

691
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
someone downloaded from somewhere

692
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
because

693
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,400
they thought it would look interesting

694
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,919
you know it's not always like a

695
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,480
malicious activity it's more of like hey

696
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
maybe you shouldn't be downloading that

697
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
um and then of course that leads to

698
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
answering who did this so you can reach

699
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
out and communicate to them

700
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,440
the reason i put that there is because

701
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,960
one of the things i feel very strongly

702
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,760
about

703
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,799
is um how security

704
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,080
people in in a company are viewed uh the

705
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,720
way

706
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
that we communicate and the way that we

707
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
build bridges between other departments

708
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
is incredibly important because at the

709
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,520
end of the day we're all kind of trying

710
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
to do the same thing

711
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,480
um and i've seen a lot of uh negativity

712
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,600
thrown towards like

713
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,279
security teams and things like that

714
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,120
because we're usually the people telling

715
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
people to stop doing stuff

716
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,960
so of course just remembering that there

717
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
can be a person at the other

718
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,400
side of the fence when you're looking at

719
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
something it's very important to keep

720
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,559
things

721
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,960
you know nice we want we want to be

722
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,320
liked so that

723
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,919
when things happen you know we're able

724
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,760
to respond more effectively

725
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,600
so we're now towards the end

726
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
of this presentation and we're going to

727
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,039
talk a little bit about

728
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,000
a write-up now i spoke to a lot of

729
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,400
people

730
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
that are on the red side of the you know

731
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,279
red team side of things and i spend most

732
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,840
of my time talking to people within blue

733
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,320
side

734
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,840
you know at the end of the day we're all

735
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,360
just trying to do the same thing

736
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,720
but our efforts again i'm going to

737
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
emphasize is our efforts

738
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,279
are judged or graded or you know

739
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,159
valued based on how we communicate right

740
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
one of the things that is very hard for

741
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,840
us

742
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
is documentation yeah you know i've

743
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
talked to some people that are

744
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,039
incredible when it comes to you know how

745
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,000
they can get break

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
into a system right but they'll usually

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
say the write-up is like the

748
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,120
most not is not the fun part right this

749
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
is we're not at the fun part at this

750
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,520
point

751
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
um gathering evidence for me and trying

752
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,279
to correlate between different data

753
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,080
sources

754
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
to me is like a game and i really enjoy

755
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
it

756
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,880
but writing it up is not fun so here is

757
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
the benefit of answering those questions

758
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,960
in your mind

759
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,840
on a notepad on a text editor whatever

760
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
you want to use

761
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,640
is that usually you can just kind of

762
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,559
copy paste or brain dump

763
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,760
most of your answers into a very good

764
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
document

765
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
i mean i even write documents sometimes

766
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
about an investigation

767
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,679
with the sub headers or subsections

768
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,159
being

769
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,159
the question themselves i'll have like

770
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,760
what this happened

771
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,559
why because of this who was involved

772
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,919
because of this and i'll just

773
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,919
i'll word it like that because it aligns

774
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,039
with the way that i did the

775
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,080
investigation

776
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,120
and it doesn't make it so that i'm

777
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,320
recreating a document

778
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,640
right so one of the things that are

779
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,400
incredibly important as you kind of put

780
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,159
all this together as analysis

781
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,919
what did you do right so um i can say i

782
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,720
was able

783
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,760
to collect this log from this machine

784
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,400
and i did it at this time and i grabbed

785
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
it from this location

786
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,320
um so when did you take these actions

787
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
was answered by that right

788
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,039
so i did it at 7 00 am the alert came in

789
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
at 6 50 a.m i hope that's not happening

790
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,559
that's too early

791
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
but you know things happen so what

792
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,919
answers did you obtain

793
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,799
well you know um i was not the logs

794
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,720
themselves were inconclusive or

795
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
i was not they did not yield any

796
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,000
evidence

797
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
of there being malicious activity

798
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
surrounding this alert

799
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,640
right um is escalation required um

800
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
this is usually people are aware of this

801
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
once you escalate you ring the bell

802
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
you know things things happen people

803
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,840
will know

804
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
um but it's always really important to

805
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,120
state that it happened

806
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,200
why when a manager is looking at this or

807
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
someone in some kind of leadership role

808
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,720
is looking at this they wanna these are

809
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,279
the

810
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
this is what they want to know right

811
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,640
what happened

812
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
what was done uh what policies were

813
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,960
invoked or things actually occurred what

814
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,080
was the conclusion

815
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,559
so let's talk about that false positive

816
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,600
true positive

817
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,320
false negative usually when it comes to

818
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,200
this question

819
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
i try to for example if it's a false

820
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,799
positive

821
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,279
i'll try to explain why and try to

822
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,799
suggest some kind of fix for this right

823
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
if it's a false positive and it's due to

824
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
the logic itself that was attempting to

825
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,799
find this suspicious binary

826
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,399
well maybe the binary or that way that

827
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
that binary works is no longer relevant

828
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,240
so we may need to tune

829
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,520
the alert or the logic a little bit so

830
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
suggestions are always great especially

831
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,720
for those that are writing you know

832
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
detection logic

833
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
and of course this last point is uh

834
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,080
always provide

835
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,520
contextual data um i

836
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,799
am big on schedules right i mean

837
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
i'd probably drive siri insane with how

838
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,640
many times i tell her to schedule

839
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,919
something on my calendar

840
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,360
and things like that um but time stamps

841
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,000
and like how

842
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,559
things happen and you know providing

843
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,360
when you say

844
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,919
you know i grab this log from this

845
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,559
machine

846
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,880
right you sh i usually do this i'll put

847
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
in parentheses

848
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,279
what log right i want to i want to avoid

849
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,120
anyone that's reading what i'm writing

850
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,559
to reach out and

851
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,799
ask me for clarification i want it to be

852
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,559
as clear and as concise

853
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,600
as i possibly can make it because

854
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,279
what happens when they question you is

855
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,440
that you may forget what happened and

856
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,080
then

857
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
you know the conversation may change and

858
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
then things may not there may be gaps in

859
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,200
the

860
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,039
investigation as a whole that's never

861
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,240
fun uh to have to redo an investigation

862
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,960
so

863
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,840
provide as much contextual data into

864
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,320
your

865
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
write-up so let's move on to the next

866
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,480
slide

867
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
so i just wanted to throw out a quick

868
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
hypothesis

869
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,279
i know i talked a little bit about the

870
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,120
questions that you asked um i just

871
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
wanted to give a quick

872
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
alert example again we're gonna just

873
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,880
keep messing with uh

874
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,279
windows here and and some av stuff

875
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,559
because you know

876
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,440
it happens and uh you know we have this

877
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,919
uh

878
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,880
malicious file and this weird location

879
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,840
which is

880
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
normally what happens um except for you

881
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
know attackers now or

882
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,679
you know they're realizing that so many

883
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,440
people are monitoring these directories

884
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,320
but that's fine

885
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,000
so um you're going to form a hypothesis

886
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,799
right so i believe that this there

887
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,559
should not be this specific

888
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,120
hash executing from this specific

889
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,919
directory

890
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,679
my hypothesis is the machine is

891
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,120
compromised right

892
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
so i'm looking for evidence of that

893
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,520
compromise while also trying to prove

894
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,000
myself

895
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,440
wrong right like you're trying to say

896
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,360
okay uh you know is

897
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,120
if i find the evidence right then now i

898
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
know that my hypothesis is right but you

899
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,640
spend as much time looking for

900
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,399
evidence of it not occurring right i

901
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,520
mean no one wants things to be

902
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,399
compromised but

903
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
it happens so again the hypothesis

904
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,000
drives

905
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,919
the evidence and drives the way that you

906
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,600
look at the investigation

907
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,480
so now there's a lot of words on on this

908
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,039
slide

909
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,919
and i apologize for that i try to again

910
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,000
try to make this as condensed and

911
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,399
concise as i could but this is an

912
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,200
example

913
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,640
right so we looked at that av detection

914
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,159
and you know as an example and i did it

915
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,200
right up here

916
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,520
that encapsulates kind of what it is

917
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
that i'm trying to

918
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,440
you know indicate here and that is

919
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,320
providing

920
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,440
evidence and you know contextual data

921
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,399
is what allows for leadership to make a

922
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,039
decision

923
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,399
or to view the value in your work

924
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,640
right so i'm not going to read this um

925
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
you know it's it's a lot

926
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,720
honestly but again as you can see you

927
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,480
know with some words i'll put

928
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
you know when something happened on

929
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,320
which machine it happened what was the

930
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,440
file name

931
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,000
what was the ocean information that you

932
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,279
know led to me

933
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
believing something you know was either

934
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,320
malicious

935
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,519
not malicious providing links for

936
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,360
these websites for example like virus

937
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,559
total and you know

938
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,320
hybrid analysis or whatever it is that

939
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,159
you use um you know

940
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,399
if you use a sandbox like joe sandbox or

941
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,360
something like that

942
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,480
uh what were the iocs that you observed

943
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,039
um providing all that stuff and me i

944
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,360
love when there's a bunch of attachments

945
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,519
on a write-up right and it'll be like

946
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,679
hey um i have this attachment of the

947
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,919
screenshot that shows this thing that i

948
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,960
was looking for

949
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,519
um those are great those provide you

950
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,640
know me okay so

951
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,039
this is what you found and of course um

952
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,080
you know there's some

953
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,799
there's some good here where if you are

954
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,600
working with

955
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,320
other analysts or my case like you're

956
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,200
trying to

957
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,840
you know um build up an analyst or you

958
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
know trying to work on the skill set of

959
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,799
analysis

960
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,320
right you can always review this and

961
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
provide suggestions right feedback

962
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,240
you can look at the write up and you

963
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
know gauge whether or not hey

964
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
you know a pivot would have been really

965
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,200
cool right here

966
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,279
uh this would have led for this type of

967
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,799
artifact collection from

968
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,440
this log source something like that but

969
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
this is just you know

970
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,519
an example uh write up of something that

971
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
you know i see often with stuff

972
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,440
happening on files so

973
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,399
last note on write-ups uh of course this

974
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,360
is

975
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,240
uh probably four or five more questions

976
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,880
uh

977
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,360
just always keep this in mind your

978
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
write-ups can invoke

979
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,679
change in a process as an organization

980
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,399
uh

981
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,039
you want to ensure as an analyst that is

982
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,840
providing

983
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,519
data um that your data is sound

984
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,679
and that it it makes the most sense

985
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
because what i've seen in the past is

986
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,679
when those decisions are made

987
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,880
by leadership they'll reference your

988
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,000
write-up you want that to be impeccable

989
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,960
you want that to be you know everything

990
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,519
you want to

991
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,679
pour everything into that and that's i

992
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
feel very strongly about that

993
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,159
it again emphasizes your value as an

994
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,200
analyst

995
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,799
um so write it with that expectation

996
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,200
um sometimes i've seen i've done this

997
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,399
myself where

998
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,880
i may not spend as much time

999
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,600
investigating a false positive

1000
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
i've already determined it's a false

1001
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,880
positive i've answered all the questions

1002
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
and i write it up and i just and i just

1003
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,039
you know i'm moving on to the next fun

1004
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,720
thing right what i've fallen victim to

1005
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
because of my own actions is uh you know

1006
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,080
maybe

1007
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,840
one of those tickets you know even

1008
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,279
though it's a false positive they're

1009
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,399
grabbed

1010
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,720
to look at to review and it doesn't look

1011
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,679
that great

1012
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,880
uh so what i do is i'm probably

1013
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
arguably too verbal sometimes but i make

1014
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,000
sure that

1015
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,480
most of my write-ups if not all are

1016
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
written with the expectation that at any

1017
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,560
point this can be used as a reference

1018
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
material this can be used for

1019
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,599
to teach somebody or you know uh to

1020
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,399
guide another investigation that

1021
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,480
sometimes investigations are related

1022
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,359
okay so another point uh would anyone be

1023
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,359
able to replicate the actions you took

1024
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,399
this is incredibly important um so if if

1025
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
you have access to the same data that i

1026
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,320
have and

1027
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,560
you are able to pull the same data that

1028
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,639
i'm able to pull as an analyst

1029
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,079
can you use my write-up to recreate

1030
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,800
the investigation um the reason that

1031
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
this is incredibly powerful is because

1032
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,159
when you are working

1033
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,560
in a team setting right as a sock or

1034
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,359
whatever

1035
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,399
analyst type role it's always

1036
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,599
awesome to be able to understand

1037
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
why someone did something or why you

1038
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,720
know someone chose this way of working

1039
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,560
on the investigation i always find those

1040
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:04,960
to be

1041
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,280
really interesting and the only way to

1042
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
really do that is to be

1043
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,040
able to replicate the actions that that

1044
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,240
you took or they took

1045
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,839
right so i write my write-ups in a way

1046
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,960
that anyone can

1047
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,160
look at it and see what i was thinking

1048
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,680
okay so did this investigation lead to

1049
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,440
potential improvement in detection

1050
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,200
i talked a little bit about how false

1051
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,280
positives at least how i feel they

1052
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,000
should be addressed

1053
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,079
uh you know there are false positives

1054
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,240
that can't benefit from tuning

1055
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,280
uh but the majority of false positives

1056
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,800
probably could use a little bit of

1057
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,040
you know marinating here there to make

1058
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,560
it a little bit better

1059
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,040
um so at least in my opinion from my

1060
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,920
experience

1061
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,880
uh so that's always really good to be

1062
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,079
aware of that

1063
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,880
if you change logic well they might ask

1064
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,920
you why

1065
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
and if you have a really thorough

1066
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,359
write-up you can just point them to

1067
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,160
their items

1068
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
this is why right because of this

1069
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,320
because all this action took place

1070
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,680
and it didn't make sense under the

1071
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
context of this alert logic

1072
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,200
all right so another point would senior

1073
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,000
leadership be

1074
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,839
able to use his write-up to address any

1075
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,280
concerns now we asked we

1076
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,119
kind of answered this before uh just

1077
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,960
wanted to put a big point to this

1078
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,280
again uh because i've seen this happen

1079
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,560
time and time again

1080
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,680
um your write-ups will be used as

1081
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,359
evidence uh as uh you know hey

1082
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,880
our sock saw this did this

1083
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,000
and we are now doing this uh so

1084
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
just keep that in mind so did you

1085
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
document your findings

1086
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
and or conclusions in a wiki i'm just

1087
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,599
going to throw wiki out there

1088
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,480
whatever it is that your team uses to uh

1089
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
put all your knowledge

1090
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,800
into um is what this is about

1091
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,720
documentation not only of your findings

1092
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,240
not only of your write-up but

1093
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,480
if your conclusions this may aid

1094
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,160
somebody that is going to have the same

1095
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,280
investigation

1096
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,599
you know or similar investigation about

1097
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,720
a similar

1098
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,440
alert or the similar what so it's always

1099
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,079
good to

1100
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
kind of put all this together not only a

1101
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,599
write-up for leadership but then

1102
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,599
have a write-up or at least a condensed

1103
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,119
version of this uh

1104
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
to explain your actions and put in a

1105
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,640
wiki because of course

1106
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,920
um you know one of the things that's

1107
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,000
amazing about this field is the ability

1108
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
to be able to transfer

1109
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,920
information and knowledge and what you

1110
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,079
know to other people so wikis are very

1111
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,800
powerful

1112
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
with that so i feel like i've

1113
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,040
probably ran um a little bit over

1114
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,680
i'm not sure um i just kind of left this

1115
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
this slide open

1116
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,760
uh for more examples um i tried to cover

1117
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,160
them

1118
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,359
during the slides as much as possible so

1119
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,079
i'll just kind of put this slide up as a

1120
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:46,640
question

1121
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,200
if anyone has any questions um or

1122
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,400
anything that they

1123
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,560
you know want to talk about in regards

1124
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,920
to this

1125
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:05,680
i'm open

1126
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,560
christopher

1127
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,280
how you doing okay a great uh

1128
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,320
presentation

1129
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,440
uh you indicated

1130
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,000
thorough bulletproof documentation

1131
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
is the actor practical in a busy

1132
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,240
stressful environment where before you

1133
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,599
even

1134
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,960
finish one investigation

1135
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
you already have another event another

1136
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,720
event so how would you

1137
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,000
be able to put all the thoroughness into

1138
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,640
a write-up

1139
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,000
yes so the way that i do it

1140
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,079
and of course this may only you know

1141
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,920
work for me so i'm just gonna relate

1142
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
what works for me

1143
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,640
um the way that i do it is most of the

1144
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,680
time

1145
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
while i'm going through an investigation

1146
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,359
and i'm trying to

1147
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,119
end the investigation i'm trying to get

1148
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,720
to a conclusion

1149
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,320
um my write-up will be a collection of

1150
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,680
the questions that i answered in the

1151
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,640
first place

1152
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,119
so my write-ups as thorough as they may

1153
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:11,920
be

1154
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,640
usually at the end of the investigation

1155
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,440
if i copy paste my notes and my evidence

1156
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
i already have kind of a rough draft of

1157
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
an investigation

1158
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,599
like of my notes and everything and when

1159
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,960
i spend the most time

1160
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
kind of brushing it up or making it

1161
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
better is like

1162
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,320
sometimes it has to be after because as

1163
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,160
you said like in our field

1164
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,960
um you know i can't i can't express how

1165
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,560
many times something happens or anything

1166
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:36,880
like

1167
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,119
you know you hear the news and this new

1168
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,960
vulnerability for example and then this

1169
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,240
is happening and

1170
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,839
oh this this person's happening and of

1171
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,240
course this user fell for this fishing

1172
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,040
thing and

1173
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,720
all that's happening all at the same

1174
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,320
time usually

1175
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,400
so of course we have to try to have the

1176
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
best work-life balance possible but i

1177
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,440
will

1178
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,000
tell you that i spend a lot of time

1179
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
sometimes after work

1180
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
uh you know editing some of my write-ups

1181
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,040
because

1182
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
i want them to be great but

1183
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,839
if i need to just you know answer those

1184
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,599
questions give it to management

1185
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,200
make them aware of what's going on

1186
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,119
they're still going to encapsulate those

1187
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,640
questions they're still going to have

1188
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,319
that fundamental

1189
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,920
rough draft of what it is that i'm

1190
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,599
trying to make sure that

1191
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,880
they have knowledge of so i don't know

1192
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,160
if that answers your questions but

1193
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,760
that's how i kind of do it

1194
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,160
um i try to get everything in paper and

1195
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
if i need to make edits later

1196
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,800
