somebody that

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,000
we know and appreciate in the hospital

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
and i hope

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,080
that he gets better soon uh you guys

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,439

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,040
his nick cirlin uh his sam

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
i'm not sure if you're here sam but if

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
if you're seeing this for the hospital

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
we truly hope that you get better and

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
you come back soon

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
we need you well and helping us like you

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
always do

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,040
i hope the rest of you are keeping

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
yourself safe

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,159
many of you have heard what's going on

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
and supposedly there's a second wave or

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:54,960
whatever

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,479
so uh just uh keep status quo and then

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,680
try to keep yourself

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
safe as much as you can we will continue

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
doing our meetings online this doesn't

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
seem to be relenting

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
uh i was actually thinking maybe do a

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
one-off at the library the library is

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
closed

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,080
so we can't really meet but as soon as

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
we can meet we obviously will go back to

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
to in person we may have to do something

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,959
hybrid because

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,680
we now get the california people here in

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,080
the

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
people from all over the country uh

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
attending our meeting so

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
that's that's very exciting and uh we'll

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,120
keep or

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
find a way to keep these meetings going

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,680
so we can allow as many people as we can

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
so with that said uh we'll be announcing

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,120
soon we had

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
probably two or three meetings more for

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800
the rest of the year

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
one of them might be a catch for the

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
flag

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,879
uh or something hands-on

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,200
uh and we'll be announcing it soon uh

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,239

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,040
on iot devices and make try to make uh

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
counter measures for ddos attacks or

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,560
customer baits

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
are you guys seeing the slides properly

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
they look really small they do

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
yeah just wanna make sure

132
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,520
like they're taking up a quarter of your

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
screen that better

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,560
could go even bigger

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
there you go there we go all right

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
so what's lisa

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
uh at least did i go

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
too far all right all right what's lisa

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
lisa stands for linux sandbox

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
it's a the software provides an

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
automated linux malware

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
analysis on various cpu architectures

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,479
right

144
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,600
it utilizes qemu special

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
specialty kernel extensions plugins to

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
detonate log and generate and report

147
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
and generate reports for malware in a

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,000
virtual disposable environment okay

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
you can change again to just go right to

150
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,240
github

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,759
fork it or clone it and uh

152
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,319
if you really like it and do updates

153
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,600
contribute and post

154
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
and do and pull requests are welcome to

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,919
the project i believe

156
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,360
right um chad you want to

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
talk about anything on this slide

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,319
so basically one of the problems that we

159
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
had

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,039
as we were trying to capture

161
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,080
and analyze these different types of

162
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
malware are uh

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
competing architectures and

164
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
the nature of the honey pots that we've

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
produced

166
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,599
results in us fetching malware samples

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,319
from everything from x86 to arms to

168
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
spark

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,919
in some cases you know if we have an x86

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,120
sample that's good

171
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,440
in other cases if we don't have an x86

172
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
sample we might only

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,919
have access to a mips or an arm sample

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
so our quest was to find

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,880
a means you know like in cuckoo you have

176
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
windows support and they've had windows

177
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,160
support and then they recently added

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
linux support which is great

179
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,319
but our problem was they did not have

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
foreign architecture support it's in the

181
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
works apparently but they didn't have it

182
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,280
so what lisa

183
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
provided to us was an opportunity for

184
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
simulation or not simulation but

185
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
emulation of these foreign architectures

186
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,240
to actually get execution of malware

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
which is something that we were working

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
on internally anyway

189
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,840
but the people behind the lisa project

190
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
took it one step further than even we

191
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,000
were thinking

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
at that point and they wrote kernel

193
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
extensions and

194
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,879
uh the actual framework for deploying

195
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
these things on the fly

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
to be able to give you low level system

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
hooks for

198
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,440
monitoring um system calls and network

199
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,639
traffic and all that stuff

200
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
so that's pretty much the the really

201
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,840
awesome part of this project that shines

202
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,280
is that

203
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
if you're collecting linux malware

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,559
and it's coming in this uh

205
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,080
wide array of potential architectures

206
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
it doesn't care it will take whatever

207
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
sample you pass to it it will identify

208
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,320
which architecture it needs to be run

209
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
under it will

210
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
create basically an architecture

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
specific sandbox boot up a virtual

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,279
machine

213
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,720
on the fly detonate it and then produce

214
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
a final result

215
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
so that's what lisa is and why it is

216
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
awesome

217
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,600
again again it's multi-platform

218
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
supports multiple architectures

219
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
detonates malwares

220
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,440
in an appropriate vm so it automatically

221
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
finds out that mount what that malware

222
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
form is that it's written for what

223
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,519
architecture it's written for

224
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,000
and selects the appropriate vm

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
and has the low level system hooks and

226
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
network monitoring extensions

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
and all the reports are in json format

228
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,480
which are it's pretty nice and easy

229
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,240
easily to digest into other platforms so

230
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
one of our things is trying to get it to

231
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
ingest it into

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
either a la into our elastic

233
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
infrastructure

234
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,640
the actual report and see what

235
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,440
we could actually pull off off of it

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
some of you guys like splunk

237
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,200
one could make it easily ingested as

238
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
well into splunk as well

239
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
all right and it's easy to deploy we'll

240
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
show you exactly

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,399
all the steps you need to just copy and

242
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
paste and get this

243
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,000
running on a virtual pla on a

244
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,320
vsp all right

245
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,480
what makes up uh lisa qemu it has radar

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,079
to base statistic analysis

247
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
all right dynamic behavioral analysis

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,120
and

249
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
using cisco system traps and kernel

250
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
modules captures

251
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,600
right syscalls open checks out for open

252
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
files process trees and syscalls

253
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,279
it looks at network statistics and dns

254
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,240
and http

255
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
traffic it also gives you uh

256
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
prints out all of the telnet traffic or

257
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
irc communications

258
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
on their endpoint analysis and back

259
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,920
right so you could with blacklist so it

260
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
could tell you

261
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
if you have a subscription to uh

262
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
maximize geoip database you could

263
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
download you could put in your api key

264
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
into the system configuration it will

265
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,760
download the

266
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,279
max mine ip database for you and

267
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,760
tell you oh these ips are from china or

268
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,120
russia or brazil or

269
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,880
whatever country they're they come from

270
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,760
right and it also has a

271
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
fire hole blacklist so you could tell

272
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
you oh these ips

273
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
are or are uh known c2s on

274
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
firehole on the firehole blacklist or

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,600
our spammer ip addresses so i can tell

276
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,560
you all of these

277
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
ip statistics based on off of a third

278
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
third-party list or

279
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,079
another a third-party party uh service

280
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,839
right um

281
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,880
it's scalable with uh salary with celery

282
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
workers and

283
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,519
rabbitmq so it

284
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
it based on the docker configurations

285
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
it spins up five uh docker images one of

286
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,399
them being

287
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
two of them being uh celery workers or

288
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,120
you could scale it up to

289
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,079
10 salary work uh 10 salary workers or a

290
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
couple of vms

291
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
oh and also you could scale

292
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
and it comes with one rabbitmq server an

293
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
api server

294
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,399
and a nginx server right

295
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
so it has everything's basically you

296
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,440
could

297
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
call it through a rest api or or through

298
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
the front end

299
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
it's it's extendable you could create

300
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,040
your own modules

301
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,959
right and add uh additional

302
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,440
modules basically everything's uh all of

303
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
the modules and extensions

304
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
are can be written into with uh on

305
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
with easily in python right not too easy

306
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,760
i get

307
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,240
i guess easily it depends on the scale

308
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,800
you're

309
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,160
on on your knowledge set but

310
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,839
it's pretty it's pretty good right

311
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,600
so chad you want to add into anything

312
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
yeah so you know i already touched on

313
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
the chemo emulation part

314
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
um radar ii if you're not familiar with

315
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,160
it it's a

316
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,880
it's i personally have grown to love it

317
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,279
um

318
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,040
it is a free uh binary analysis it was

319
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,000
originally

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
created for forensic purposes and for

321
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,839
file carving but

322
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,279
it has grown and grown and grown it's

323
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,150
self-contained it has no

324
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,079
[Music]

325
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,720
no external dependencies really which

326
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
means you can get it running

327
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
just about anywhere you can have it

328
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
running on your phone you can have it

329
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,920
running on

330
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
a raspberry pi it's architecture

331
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
independent

332
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
it also can understand multiple

333
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,160
architectures

334
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
so everything from x86 to mips to arms

335
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
and this is all free you basically get

336
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
you basically get a free

337
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
uh ability to uh

338
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,519
hook into gdb it has its own debugger as

339
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,079
well

340
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,160
it's super awesome you should look into

341
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,199
it it makes

342
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,560
digging through and analyzing binaries

343
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
uh palatable it's got a learning curve

344
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
on it but i think it's a great framework

345
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,519
it's a great starting point

346
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,480
and you can automate workflows through

347
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
it

348
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,279
so that was a big selling point for us

349
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
when we saw that radar2

350
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,440
was used in here what that tells us is

351
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,519
that we can hook into radar 2

352
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
in multiple ways in multiple

353
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,519
architectures

354
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
so if we have additional analysis steps

355
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
that we want to execute in the

356
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
let's say you know that we have these

357
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,839
extensible sub-analysis modules

358
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,639
what that tells us is we could create

359
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,279
our sub

360
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,959
analysis module and we could automate

361
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,839
a radar workflow within that module to

362
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
accomplish things

363
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,519
and what i mean by uh

364
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,480
a workflow or something um if for

365
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
example we knew that at a particular

366
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,120
offset

367
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
in a binary uh you know at the beginning

368
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
of the text table and the first

369
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,079
1200 bytes in that this

370
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,600
uh data for example in a particular

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,199
sample of this type

372
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
which we could identify based on a

373
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
signature

374
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,079
was encrypted or obfuscated using a byte

375
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,160
that can be found at this offset within

376
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
memory of the binary

377
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
um we could produce a module and do all

378
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,800
of that with simple radar two commands

379
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
in python and then create a sub module

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,320
that we can hook into this pipeline

381
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
so instead of needing to uh do

382
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,279
advanced detonation or anything like

383
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,279
that we could

384
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
go into that sorry go back one more

385
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
slide i just got off track but

386
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,120
i dove into sub modules more than i

387
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,199
meant to there um

388
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,120
the dynamic behavior analysis stuff

389
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
using system tap

390
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,959
is awesome we started

391
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
down this path in trying to find this

392
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,279
because one of our initial concepts was

393
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,399
hooking syscalls

394
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,639
because it's it's a reliable means for

395
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,839
tracking

396
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
particular things so assist call is like

397
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
when your user land application goes

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,199
up to the kernel and it wants to perform

399
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,759
a network connection it must talk to the

400
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,240
kernel

401
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
over a syscall to request it opening

402
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
a socket to do that network

403
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
communication

404
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
so even if you have obfuscated uh

405
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,880
binaries

406
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
at the lower level if you just had a way

407
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,560
to

408
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
interact with the kernel and hook it and

409
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,839
begin capturing those syscalls

410
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,560
you could start to really get a peek

411
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
into what that binary is doing so

412
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,800
there's

413
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
there's libraries like s trace that do

414
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
exactly this

415
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
the problem is that there's binaries

416
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
that look for

417
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,839
s trace and the hooks that are present

418
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,519
when an s trace

419
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
call is being used and they'll prevent

420
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,399
themselves from running

421
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
so the fact that this taps into the

422
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
kernel

423
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
outside of the execution space of the

424
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
binary itself but still captures the

425
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,880
syscalls on that binary is super useful

426
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
um and that's what gives you access to

427
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,559
like

428
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,760
opening of files forking of a you know a

429
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,599
new thread is forked out of this thread

430
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
and it's created over here and then that

431
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,439
thread writes these files

432
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,039
so the fact that you can track all of

433
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,359
that and see a final report after you

434
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,559
detonate a binary

435
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,760
in the virtual container is

436
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
super useful it'll help you find

437
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
everything from c2s

438
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,200
to file rights to the system

439
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
file reads to the system because f-open

440
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,360
f-right all that kind of stuff

441
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
is all captured in syscalls

442
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,160
the additional static analysis or

443
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
network analysis

444
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,719
also aids in that

445
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,240
but it depends on how they communicate

446
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,120
right so like

447
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,160
if your malware is not doing a dns query

448
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
and it's not using http and it's not

449
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
communicating over telnet or irc

450
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
then your network statistics and

451
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
analysis

452
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,799
is going to be pretty bunk the cool part

453
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
is that it automatically creates a pcap

454
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
of everything that

455
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,360
happened on the wire so even if the

456
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
network analysis and statistics that

457
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,000
came out of

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
their pre-canned analysis fails you you

459
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
can still look at the raw

460
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,120
traffic and potentially make some more

461
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,039
uh

462
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,200
informed uh or intelligence extraction

463
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
processes around that um

464
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
the scaling and all the other stuff just

465
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,039
makes it great because that means you

466
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,720
can deploy it at scale

467
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
it's fine if you're running one sample

468
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
through it

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,880
uh in our case we're running i don't

470
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
know how many

471
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,799
a day at this point currently we're

472
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,760
sitting at

473
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
just around 10 000 samples we've

474
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
collected over the past few months

475
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
um but if you were to be in a position

476
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
and as you scale out your other ports

477
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
where you're consuming malware

478
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
and bringing malware in either from

479
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,200
external feeds or from honeypots or

480
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
however you're doing it

481
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,000
scaling that up with the celery workers

482
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,640
is preferable because each one of these

483
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
things has to spin up a deal and it

484
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,600
takes 90 seconds

485
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
i think it takes 60 or 90 seconds by

486
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,400
default is how long that thing runs

487
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
so if you have 10 workers or if you have

488
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,160
one worker

489
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
you're talking about 90 seconds of

490
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,200
downtime

491
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,679
for that to be so if your backlog is

492
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,240
building

493
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
you know being able to scale that out

494
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
very quickly and easily

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
is super important for your operation as

496
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
it's going to scale up

497
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
yeah and that's pretty much it i think

498
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,039
the default is

499
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,360
about i think the defaults 20 seconds on

500
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
the executions but it does

501
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
if you want to make sure that they're

502
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
getting a good execution maybe

503
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,960
adding it to a couple uh

504
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
no it's it's 20 on the config it's on

505
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
the default

506
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
normally it's uh but if you want a

507
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
better execution party adding like

508
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,919
another

509
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
40 50 seconds to it to let it

510
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
we've seen lower samples of uh mirai

511
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
just start hammering ip addresses and

512
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,520
start portraying

513
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
and communicating out the c2s with this

514
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,559
so

515
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,000
well and it's also possible that a smart

516
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
uh a smart adversary

517
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
will expect you to have

518
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,400
same time limits so you know they could

519
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,840
spin up their thing and then sleep for

520
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,280
two minutes before they do anything

521
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,559
because they're expecting you to

522
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,280
detonate it

523
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,240
so being able to flexibly control those

524
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,360
windows

525
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
and if you're finding that you're

526
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,080
missing a lot of stuff at a smaller

527
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
window

528
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,919
to be able to bump that up across your

529
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,280
cluster and then also

530
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,159
scale that cluster out to very quickly

531
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
to deal with that

532
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
additional overhead that you're now

533
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,039
introducing to the system

534
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,600
is super important yeah

535
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,640
to the nets all right sub modules so

536
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,520
modules are

537
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
extensible bit of lisa that allow you to

538
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,039
create or modify

539
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,679
functions of the analysis process right

540
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,760
by default analysis sub modules included

541
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
are the

542
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
the dynamic the static and the network

543
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
analysis

544
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
fastest operation analysis and not uh

545
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,360
automatic detections of our and api

546
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,400
uh virus total api hooks right these sub

547
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
modules are written in python they're

548
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
easily modified and additional

549
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
and additionally it's easy to add custom

550
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,840
sub modules

551
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,559
of your own right i when i was looking

552
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,240
through it i don't think that the

553
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
virustotal uh sub module is

554
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
uh uh i think it's commented out in the

555
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,360
configs

556
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
you have to apply your virus total api

557
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,960
key

558
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
and uncommented in the config ability to

559
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
get it to work

560
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
but you should but it's very useful to

561
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
have

562
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
you know you could anything you want to

563
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
add to this one

564
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
chad

565
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
i think he's booked about it it's a

566
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,039
monster

567
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
but yeah basically i mean this is where

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
a lot of your customizability will come

569
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,200
in

570
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
to where you know just like i talked

571
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,039
about the radar 2 plug-in

572
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,120
you could have simpler or more complex

573
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
plugins

574
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
at this point when you're doing your

575
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
analysis

576
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,720
uh to potentially

577
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
um you know like let's say

578
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,159
one of the features that this does not

579
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,480
have but may be beneficial

580
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
uh would be to get an actual memory

581
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
snapshot

582
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
of the the qmu uh instance

583
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,840
at a certain trigger or something along

584
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,320
those lines within the binary

585
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
yeah and then take a vault do a

586
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
volatility scan on it

587
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
or right right so this is where you

588
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
could implement that kind of feature

589
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
because you would have a hook into the

590
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
analysis process

591
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,760
uh that tells you when the the virtual

592
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
machine is up and running and the

593
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,520
the binary is detonated so you could say

594
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,360
hey after detonation

595
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
wait so many seconds and do a volatility

596
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
snapshot and i want to be able to see

597
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
what's running in memory of this thing

598
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
um

599
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
but likewise you could do the same thing

600
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
with you know radar too

601
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,720
if you wanted to essentially

602
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,799
detonate the thing wait x number of

603
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
seconds or wait until

604
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,880
a case and then connect into the pid

605
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
that was returned as part of that

606
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,520
process

607
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
hook your debugger and then start doing

608
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,919
some kind of memorial analysis at that

609
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,400
point

610
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,240
once this binary is unpacked

611
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,679
cases like this you may want to uh

612
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,120
like a sub module here that would be

613
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,679
useful would be identifying if it's upx

614
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,559
packed

615
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
and if it is upx packed unpack it

616
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
and get the hashes before you detonate

617
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,440
it because that may be

618
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,640
more relevant to what you're seeing like

619
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,799
there's a there's a string module that

620
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,279
that is in here for example

621
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,960
that takes whatever binary you've

622
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
submitted into the system and it runs

623
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
strings over it and then it takes the

624
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,279
output of strings and actually stores it

625
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,799
in the resulting report

626
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,240
so you can easily get a digest of all

627
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
the strings that were in this binary

628
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,279
but that's going to be basically useless

629
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
in a packed binary

630
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,640
so having access to this sub module

631
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,440
to modify it to either upx unpack it or

632
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,039
being able to write an additional sub

633
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,240
module that will upx

634
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,039
unpack it before detonation occurs or

635
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
that before that string module runs

636
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,400
are both kind of like the example of the

637
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,880
customizability and

638
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
and feature sets that you can either

639
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,640
modify or add as you go forward

640
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,000
depending on what you need

641
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,159
and it's really what's going to make

642
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,679
it's going to it's going to take you

643
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,120
from off the shelf

644
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,360
something that works kind of well to

645
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
something that you can really

646
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,720
hone and twist the knobs and make it

647
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
work exactly how you need it to work for

648
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,679
whatever your use case is

649
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,919
i think you want to talk about this one

650
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,039
yeah i mean this is

651
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,799
this is i i think i've touched on this a

652
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,520
few times already uh that basically

653
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,120
the the rad r2 being under the hood

654
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,159
uh and exposing r2 pipe which is the

655
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,559
python bindings for red r2

656
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,520
in your sub analysis modules is super

657
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,400
handy

658
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
and what what makes it handy is you can

659
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
sit down

660
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,159
at a machine have radar 2 installed

661
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,240
you can open that binary on your machine

662
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
without it being in a debugging mode so

663
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,279
you're not worrying about

664
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,919
compromising yourself come through

665
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,279
places

666
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,480
where you you see oh okay

667
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
um you know i'm in this binary i'm doing

668
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:58,960
analysis

669
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,440
and i've figured out that if i jump here

670
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,000
okay

671
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and then i count i grab the next

672
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,520
10 10 24 bytes and i'm actually looking

673
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,600
for this byte sequence within that 10 24

674
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
bytes at this offset

675
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
and once you have that human workflow

676
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,039
like you know how

677
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,840
how what commands you need to run and in

678
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,679
what order you need to run them

679
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,600
you can literally just take that exact

680
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,360
workflow and move it

681
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,559
into an r2 pipe python script

682
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,480
and turn it into an automated script

683
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,799
by literally just taking your rad r2

684
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,960
history and

685
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,679
moving it over and wrapping it in our

686
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,640
two pipe command

687
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,960
calls and then processing that output um

688
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,320
so it's i'm i'm just a fan of radar too

689
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,360
i think it's under appreciated and to

690
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,159
see

691
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,159
it included in a project that we can

692
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,679
leverage and knowing

693
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,240
what we can do as far as automation with

694
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,799
it and

695
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,760
how powerful it is is just exciting for

696
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,080
me

697
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,159
so i'm just trying to get everybody

698
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
hyped on radar

699
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,840
we gotta do a presentation on red r2

700
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,279
later on yeah

701
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,960
every time i shut the door and my

702
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,039
daughter comes in here i go on mute and

703
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,600
i

704
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,159
go stand up over there and i try i

705
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,840
thought i knocked the door like twice

706
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,919
and she just walks in what the heck

707
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
is she like she's a natural she's not

708
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,480
yeah she's a natural hacker right there

709
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,039
just

710
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,679
breaking into my room somebody asked a

711
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,360
question but i'm on my phone

712
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,640
because my laptop is being i don't want

713
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,760
to talk about it

714
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,320
um but i can't see what that message is

715
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,640
on my phone

716
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,039
so i pop up questions you want now you

717
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,440
want to take it at the end

718
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
uh i mean yeah we can take them at the

719
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,120
end that's fine yeah

720
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,760
at the end yeah yeah the questions at

721
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,399
the end

722
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,080
okay ah

723
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,039
it's only one more slide actually why

724
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
why are we using it

725
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
i gotta change that to why are we using

726
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
it over and out

727
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,840
the linux malware ecosystem is all

728
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,279
over the past few years has been

729
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,520
dominated by cyber criminals

730
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
together with iot this means that linux

731
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,159
malware is captured by

732
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,520
our honey pots come in many

733
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,200
architectures

734
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,919
while some other sandbox detonate system

735
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,480
support

736
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,840
and our detonation

737
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
system support these architectures like

738
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,360
windows you know

739
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,120
cuckoo sandbox basically mostly windows

740
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,399
there's other sandboxes out there that

741
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:40,880
are most

742
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
that are mostly windows this one's been

743
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
the one that we've

744
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,559
liked the most that's been mostly linux

745
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,520
based

746
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,600
and most of the iot devices are just

747
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
linux based systems they're not

748
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
windows they're not windows uh what what

749
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,760
is that small windows version

750
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,039
ce uh ce or some other

751
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,960
they've started releasing arm versions

752
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
now because they had to because of their

753
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
their surface pro whatever's started

754
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,480
running arm architecture so they had to

755
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
actually bite the bullet and start

756
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,520
producing

757
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,679
windows binaries and libraries and arm

758
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,559
well we might start we might have to

759
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,480
start spinning up a cuckoo sandbox for

760
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,279
just

761
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,000
those arm support arm devices too but

762
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
hopefully that's why

763
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
cuckoo's spinning up arm i will say that

764
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
luckily

765
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,039
uh in the iot space nobody seems to be

766
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
running arm

767
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,240
windows-based iot devices yet

768
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
so at least we got that that gives us a

769
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
fighting chance for a little bit yeah

770
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,960
um but yeah i mean so

771
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
to give you guys an idea as to what what

772
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,559
we're working towards and what we've

773
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,360
been building

774
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,880
over the past i mean it's

775
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,720
it's been a pipe dream for a while it's

776
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,159
finally starting to come together after

777
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,440
a lot of

778
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,559
uh fussing around and figuring out what

779
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,240
we want to build but

780
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,799
the the workflow that we've constructed

781
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,360
internally

782
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,840
it's a chicken or egg problem where we

783
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,960
need to collect

784
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,440
we need to collect malware so we can

785
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,799
build a proper consumption

786
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,679
an identification pipeline and part of

787
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
that consumption identification pipeline

788
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,840
is obviously controlled detonation

789
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,559
in a controlled environment that's

790
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,480
automated fashion

791
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,520
where we can potentially

792
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,960
include customization as we further our

793
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,799
research into different samples into

794
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,679
different uh functionality

795
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,720
and from an organization

796
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,799
we use this intelligence to protect our

797
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,480
customers so

798
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
you know what we want to do is

799
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,600
proactively

800
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,120
start identifying when the

801
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,159
bad guys are compromising

802
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,279
these iot devices

803
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,240
get samples of the malware that they're

804
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
downloading to those devices

805
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,519
and executing so that we can in turn

806
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,320
identify what are the functionalities

807
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
and features of this malware

808
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
uh but more importantly where is it

809
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,600
connecting to and how is it can how is

810
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,679
it connecting where is it connecting and

811
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,399
what what language does it speak so if

812
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,200
it's plain text

813
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
great if it's binary protocol great we

814
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,480
can reverse that

815
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,279
but our primary goal is being connected

816
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,279
into their control infrastructure

817
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,120
and essentially spying on them as they

818
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,039
try to leverage these attacks

819
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,720
um and then

820
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,640
you know if we're if we have our foot in

821
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
that door and we can

822
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,960
have a visibility into what they're

823
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,799
attacking

824
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,360
then we can identify if that what is our

825
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,320
customer

826
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,240
and begin proactively mitigating

827
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,600
those attacks as they start to direct

828
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,080
traffic

829
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,480
at our customers so for this pipeline

830
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
lisa is that controlled and customizable

831
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,399
detonation

832
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,760
uh component so we've

833
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,360
we've been tackling it in pieces the

834
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,960
first piece obviously is

835
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
if you don't have the malware to

836
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
detonate then

837
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,880
you can't really test your detonation

838
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,640
theories or plans or

839
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,399
you know customization uh so

840
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,559
starting at at the honey pots we've got

841
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,399
that sorted out or at least partially

842
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,840
sorted out

843
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,240
and then the next painful problem became

844
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,880
well crap this isn't just x86

845
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,240
you know this is what we need we need

846
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,039
x86 because we can emulate that

847
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,399
and do all kinds of you know easy stuff

848
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,840
with x86 because it's been around

849
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,159
forever but now that we're starting to

850
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,440
see that they're hitting

851
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,360
you know light bulbs and routers

852
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,200
now we have to get into mips and arm

853
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,559
and this is kind of uh

854
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,360
a frontier that is coming up and and

855
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,039
breaking out now because

856
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,039
it didn't used to have to be a problem

857
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,320
you know

858
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,559
uh there was enough low hanging x86

859
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,360
fruit but now

860
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,559
the lowest hanging most vulnerable fruit

861
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,360
is you know your grandma's modem so

862
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,559
or the refrigerator or that new tv or

863
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,760
that new iot

864
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,880
tv i mean just to put it into context

865
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,600
like

866
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,240
how weird of a problem this is i think

867
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,399
two years ago one of our teammates

868
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,120
larry cash dollar was doing research

869
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,760
into

870
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,600
a binary it may have been last year

871
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,640
but we were looking into a binary

872
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,399
uh it came with at first it came with 23

873
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,320
different exploit payloads and then we

874
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,840
found the next iteration of it in our

875
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,919
honey pots and it came with 36 and the

876
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,600
next iteration came with 48 and the next

877
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,679
generation came with like 89

878
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,799
so you know these actors are they know

879
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,080
what they're doing they're identifying

880
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,519
this low-hanging fruit

881
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,279
but as we started to dig into those

882
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,960
different exploits and try to identify

883
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
what exactly they were targeting

884
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,080
one of them was a crock pot so

885
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
somewhere in the world there was

886
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,000
somebody's crock pot that they're you

887
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,679
know slow cooking

888
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,119
uh you know a beef stew in and it's also

889
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,239
attacking a bank so this is

890
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,918
this is the reality that we live in now

891
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,079
yeah um and trying to build a pipeline

892
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,879
that can

893
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,079
deal with that kind of diversity

894
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,918
in what you might see land in your pot

895
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,879
is a challenge

896
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,918
who needs an internet connected crock

897
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,000
pot for real

898
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,520
yeah it's so so you can monitor your

899
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,679
crock pot over your phone

900
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,639
and adjust the temperature uh-oh might

901
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,040
be

902
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,560
i'm gonna be an hour late i guess i

903
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,399
better lower this to the low setting

904
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,000
instead of the medium that's right

905
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
i need to set it to warm it's done

906
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,199
cracking and potting now

907
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,000
all right like i said though here's the

908
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
our

909
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
lab set up not our lab setup but

910
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,040
our an actual lab setup that you could

911
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,839
set up

912
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,400
within about 20 minutes there's two

913
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,800
sections one is just getting the

914
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,920
uh lynn node setup going

915
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,079
i tried this on digitalocean on the five

916
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,240
dollar boxes it didn't work

917
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,160
the linden boxes did work so

918
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
i just wanted to make sure i got the

919
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,599
right one for that you guys could

920
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,240
actually

921
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,560
run and execute and go through the

922
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,839
entire the entire workflow

923
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,680
right and the very important part

924
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,320
is that this list is listens on

925
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,440
localhost

926
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,119
at the end so what you need to do is you

927
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,800
have to do this ssh

928
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,160
connect to your uh lynn node

929
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,280
right on 4242 just so that you can

930
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,079
connect to

931
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,119
your the lynn node all right let me see

932
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,960
if i can get my screen going

933
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,160
uh share my other screen

934
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
terminal

935
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,839
there's no way to just change sharing

936
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:26,720
gotta love webex

937
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,359
there we go

938
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,520
i get make this uh

939
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,839
bigger and while we're while i'm running

940
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,800
commands

941
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
we'll get

942
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,160
basically i'm going to i already shared

943
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,079
out the slides everyone has access to

944
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,240
them so we could go

945
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,599
let me just uh get out of full screen

946
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,839
mode

947
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,959
oh

948
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,040
so you're going to run through these

949
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,200
steps if it doesn't work

950
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,359
this is actually gonna work because i

951
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,880
disabled the firewall

952
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,320
these were additional troubleshooting

953
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
steps if you had problems but i

954
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,599
integrated them into the first set of

955
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,720
slides in this slide all right what

956
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
you're gonna want to do is reboot

957
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,560
okay and then here's some

958
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,079
uh reference materials for

959
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,720
the for lisa and my daughter's yelling

960
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,839
at me through the door

961
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,180
which is really fun you know

962
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,000
[Laughter]

963
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,839
so it's breaking my concentration while

964
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,000
i'm talking

965
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,040
one sec all right stop sharing

966
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,160
uh where's the escape

967
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,279
there we go now i could

968
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,599
so i'm still sharing great so i'll go

969
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,839
here

970
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
copy that

971
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,880
and just paste all that in

972
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
and while this is running we could take

973
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,000
some we could take questions

974
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,200
all right

975
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,920
uh ch uh rod you want to read off some

976
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
questions on here

977
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,799
yeah um

978
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,800
would there be cases where malware tries

979
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,599
to detect

980
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,720
is on uh

981
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,440
a bm and ends up hiding on all the

982
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,000
stools

983
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,560
yes normally there there is a

984
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,720
malware does try to detect if it's on a

985
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,960
vm and probably not execute if it's on a

986
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,560
vm

987
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,200
so it could check to see if it's uh

988
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,560
if there's any uh docker drivers or vm

989
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,680
drivers

990
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,920
and say hey this is a vm i'm not going

991
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,119
to detonate on this

992
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,359
or on this type of sandbox or try to

993
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,200
actually run

994
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,560
there's also um

995
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,880
there's architecture specific flags and

996
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,280
things that they can do

997
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,079
so if you are on an arm device for

998
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,359
example

999
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,440
there are things that you can place in

1000
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
registers

1001
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,359
and then execute particular commands

1002
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,800
that will cause those registers to

1003
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,520
change in particular ways

1004
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,040
and these are part of the actual device

1005
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,640
spec but depending on how

1006
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,160
the emulation works the responses that

1007
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,040
are loaded into those registers

1008
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,280
can kind of leak if it's a real device

1009
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,680
or if it's emulated

1010
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,800
or if it's running in a vm etc so

1011
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,079
there are checks a lot of the

1012
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,200
the vm detect stuff

1013
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,079
is pretty rudimentary and on top of that

1014
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,200
the authors

1015
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
because this isn't just hey we're trying

1016
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
to emulate arm

1017
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,160
it's also a case of hey we're trying to

1018
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,240
trick malware

1019
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,599
there's actually i believe in one of the

1020
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,599
modules that we have here

1021
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,880
that comes with lisa is a vm

1022
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,520
detect so basically an anti-vm anti-vmer

1023
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,000
to where it identifies some of those

1024
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,599
edge cases

1025
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,520
where it knows that a vm detect is going

1026
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,880
to be attempted and it

1027
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,359
patches around them or modifies

1028
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,720
functionality to trick

1029
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,399
the detection process

1030
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,200
once again another beauty of the sub

1031
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,599
modules you may be able to identify

1032
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,160
those things during analysis

1033
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,160
um and proactively patch against them

1034
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,079
um and i mean practically patch against

1035
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,440
them in the sense that like

1036
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,680
the under the underpinnings that are rad

1037
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,520
r2

1038
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,280
do have the ability to do uh

1039
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,920
writing directly into a binary so for

1040
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,359
example if you know

1041
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,079
that they're not stripping this binary

1042
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,680
and that they have a function called

1043
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,440
you know exit vm or something

1044
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,720
you could go into red r2 run the

1045
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,079
analysis

1046
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,119
find the function figure out the length

1047
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,000
of the function

1048
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,119
and then trace back to every place that

1049
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,400
it's called

1050
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,839
and then knop that function call

1051
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,079
to bypass that function and you could do

1052
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,280
that automatically if you were to write

1053
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,400
a smart enough script so

1054
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,359
this is one of those cases where yes

1055
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,480
it's possible but

1056
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,880
yes i can already think of ways to

1057
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,240
defeat it

1058
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,599
in an automated fashion

1059
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
um but it's one of those things where

1060
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,839
you don't know what they're gonna do

1061
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,960
until they do it

1062
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,079
and a lot of the

1063
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
i'll say a lot of the samples and a lot

1064
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,200
of the actors that we see show up in our

1065
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599
honey pots

1066
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,240
they are not the highest like you're not

1067
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,760
you're not going to

1068
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
come in here and find you know a nation

1069
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,319
state

1070
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,520
that is targeting another nation state

1071
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,240
with a highly targeted attack has

1072
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
accidentally dropped some

1073
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,720
really crazy malware into your you know

1074
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,760
your piece of crap

1075
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
ssh honeypot like it's not going to

1076
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,119
happen

1077
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:33,200
so uh the the level of your adversary

1078
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
isn't that high in a lot of these cases

1079
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,319
and the vm detects will be

1080
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,480
pretty simple to defeat in a lot of

1081
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,680
cases

1082
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,119
typically what you see are timing

1083
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,400
checks and those are usually

1084
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,720
more geared towards attempting to

1085
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,560
identify when a debugger is present

1086
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,599
versus

1087
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,839
attempting to identify when you're in a

1088
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,680
sandbox

1089
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,440
here's a uh a good question are there

1090
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,280
are there any iot devices on the market

1091
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,000
that are

1092
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,480
the least vulnerable what architecture

1093
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,599
or models seen by you guys are the most

1094
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,760
hard and towards a

1095
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,359
uh against a a average malware payload

1096
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,400
um you know

1097
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,119
i can't tell you what brand you should

1098
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:27,520
pick

1099
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,880
i can only tell you what brands you

1100
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
should probably avoid

1101
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,480
um it's a lot easier

1102
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,680
and it's it's in it's in part due to our

1103
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
myopic view of the problem

1104
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
right so it's we're not going out and

1105
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,079
looking at all of these iot devices

1106
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,839
that are rock solid and never have a

1107
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,200
problem

1108
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,319
um we're looking at a subset of

1109
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,079
infections that are targeting known

1110
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,160
vulnerable devices

1111
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,800
uh and then we can start to find

1112
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,480
patterns across them

1113
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,880
so like anything from zte if you have

1114
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,760
one in your house

1115
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,520
just unplug it and throw it in

1116
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,880
the trash can

1117
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,960
or take it into your lab and start

1118
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,079
picking it apart because there's

1119
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,520
probably problems with it

1120
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,119
we've seen uh

1121
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,319
zte be a big problem

1122
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,839
um there's another one from china that's

1123
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,000
basically if it's from china

1124
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,760
it's bad it's a pretty general rule

1125
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,640
uh like dvrs we've seen repeated

1126
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,160
problems dvrs

1127
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,079
but it's not just chinese branding

1128
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,079
anymore you know we're finding stuff

1129
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,920
where it's d-link and it's um

1130
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,119
zixel and you know some brands that have

1131
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,119
a have a reputation for being security

1132
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,680
oriented and being pretty decent

1133
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,160
they also have problems so

1134
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,760
i can't tell you what device you should

1135
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,079
get i can say that i like ubiquiti's

1136
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:56,720
personally

1137
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,240
they seem to be pretty good they're

1138
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,960
featureful they're reasonably priced

1139
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,560
i feel like the features you get out of

1140
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,119
them for the price are decent

1141
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,640
and they've had their share problems too

1142
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,079
so you just kind of gotta roll the dice

1143
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,440
um i don't i don't know i don't

1144
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
buy particularly cutting edge brand new

1145
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,119
network gear

1146
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,599
um a lot of the stuff that i'll buy will

1147
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,240
be

1148
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,520
a little bit older and

1149
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,280
you can basically just take whatever

1150
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,040
manufacturer you're looking at

1151
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,240
and do a google search for

1152
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,000
you know netgear cve uh d-link cve

1153
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,520
linksys cve uh and

1154
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,040
start to see do they have a repeated

1155
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,400
history

1156
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
of cves you can even go so far as to to

1157
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,800
google the model number

1158
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,400
uh of the device that you're looking at

1159
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
to see if there are known exploits that

1160
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,240
potentially impact it

1161
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,760
but that's about as good as you can do

1162
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,480
as a consumer

1163
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,000
great here's another

1164
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,160
question uh have you worked on any

1165
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,760
industrial iot devices with systems

1166
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,880
running variants like vxworks

1167
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,839
or ge

1168
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,480
we i'll say that we haven't uh

1169
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
dove into those a lot i can tell you

1170
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,560
that in our research while looking into

1171
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,720
some of this stuff

1172
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,240
we have found industrial systems

1173
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,280
inadvertently exposed and

1174
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,880
probably compromised

1175
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,280
but most of those cases are there's like

1176
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,480
one that's called like rockwell

1177
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,240
automation

1178
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,319
and they basically take these old

1179
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,680
systems

1180
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,760
and they provide this interface like a

1181
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,520
serial interface that they can hook into

1182
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,640
this thing

1183
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,880
and then plug an ethernet cable into it

1184
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,240
and then you can get to that

1185
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,680
that thing over the internet so they're

1186
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,200
taking stuff that wasn't internet

1187
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,400
connected and making it internet

1188
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,520
connected

1189
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,599
uh and we've seen a good amount of that

1190
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,920
to where you know you start searching

1191
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,520
for something and you're like well this

1192
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,359
is kind of weird this this banner looks

1193
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,400
a little bit different it's not

1194
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,319
widespread

1195
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,920
and then you find oh this is some

1196
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,079
rockwell automation connector so you're

1197
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,440
not really sure what's on the other side

1198
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,559
of it and you're not going to figure out

1199
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,079
what's on the other side of it until you

1200
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,520
break laws but looking at it and knowing

1201
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,640
that it

1202
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,200
it is either exhibiting vulnerable

1203
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,040
characteristics

1204
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,680
or the real nightmare is when we

1205
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,760
actually observe it participating

1206
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,640
in an attack that lets us know that this

1207
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
thing's compromised because

1208
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,440
there's there's no way that this

1209
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,119
whatever industrial machine behind this

1210
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,599
rockwell automation endpoint here

1211
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,480
should be sending a send flood but it is

1212
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,079
so

1213
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,000
you know there's cases like that as well

1214
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,520
uh here's another one

1215
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,359
if you have her of a coffee machine

1216
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,160
getting brands don't worry

1217
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,760
i haven't heard about that but i totally

1218
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,240
believe it

1219
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,599
so there was a guy a couple years ago

1220
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,760
uh that was heard running was called

1221
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,280
brickerbot

1222
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,559
and basically he was getting sick

1223
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,000
of all of the iot kids running around

1224
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
you know taking over everybody's this or

1225
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,359
that

1226
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,040
so he took it upon himself to

1227
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
take the same exact exploits that they

1228
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,400
were using

1229
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,520
uh and then once he got into and i say

1230
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
exploits very loosely because a majority

1231
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
of that attack was just weak

1232
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,599
ssh credentials that were not changed on

1233
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,319
the devices

1234
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,599
either because they couldn't be or

1235
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,079
because of owners didn't know they

1236
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,200
should change them or

1237
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,240
what but they had really bad credentials

1238
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,760
so what this guy was doing was going

1239
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,800
around the internet and

1240
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,040
ssh into these things in an automated

1241
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,079
form

1242
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,680
uh and then once he connected into the

1243
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,920
device he told him to like

1244
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,119
you know delete every file in the etsy

1245
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:07,680
thing

1246
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,720
and try and flash the flash memory

1247
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,839
and basically destroy this device as

1248
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,200
much as possible and then he would tell

1249
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,640
it to reboot

1250
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,960
under the hope that the damage that he

1251
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,480
had done either into

1252
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,760
the flash memory uh

1253
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,599
the persistent configuration settings

1254
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,520
that he tried to delete and overwrite

1255
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,839
and modify and mess up

1256
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,760
or the system files being removed from

1257
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,319
some of the mounted storage that might

1258
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,119
be writable

1259
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,800
would cause that device to not be

1260
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,559
functional so

1261
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,000
that was his entire goal so to hear that

1262
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,800
somebody is trashing or ransom wearing a

1263
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,280
coffee pot sounds totally reasonable

1264
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,359
they probably didn't mean to but they

1265
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,520
did

1266
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
so here's another question i'm sorry

1267
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,200
they meant to but they didn't know they

1268
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,559
were doing it to a coffee pot i'll put

1269
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,440
it that way

1270
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,359
it's that coffee pot probably had some

1271
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,680
underlying

1272
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,559
flaw and they were targeting other

1273
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,960
devices

1274
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,720
but i mean i'd be pretty pissed off if i

1275
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,880
went to get coffee and it told me to pay

1276
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,440
bitcoin

1277
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,400
yeah me too i need my coffee in the

1278
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,720
morning

1279
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,680
to make a cup of coffee are you kidding

1280
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,839
me

1281
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,880
in the beginning as it's spinning up you

1282
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,640
might see some errors that

1283
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,000
uh it's not work it's not working it

1284
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,720
speak up

1285
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,040
or that the worker can't connect that's

1286
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,520
because uh the rabbit mq server

1287
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,119
didn't finish turning spinning up so

1288
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,599
uh the celery worker actually starts

1289
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:48,559
connecting again

1290
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,599
so you can't connect here

1291
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,000
because the rabbit mq is still getting

1292
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,920
configured down here

1293
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,880
right so it config it gets configured

1294
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,440
and then

1295
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,319
it actually starts working it starts

1296
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,079
connect it gets connected again

1297
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,800
all right so now we're up

1298
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,559
lisa is actually running on this lynn

1299
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,079
node right

1300
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,960
so right now what we have to do is make

1301
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,040
sure we get an ssh connection to it

1302
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,480
or connect to it again

1303
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,839
right and i'm going to just

1304
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,119
grab that and

1305
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,240
just change out my

1306
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,880
actually just double check yeah so

1307
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,720
what i did here was on this docker

1308
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,559
compose i did a dash

1309
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,960
d and then i connected to the log with

1310
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,000
the dash follow

1311
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,040
with the dash dash follow right so

1312
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,319
basically what that means

1313
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,680
i can just go into this session

1314
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,880
right ctrl c it's still

1315
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,680
it's still running

1316
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,720
right they're still up and running okay

1317
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,400
so there's no problem there

1318
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,319
i could exit it no problem

1319
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,359
grab that ip address go to

1320
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,680
this other window here yeah

1321
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:20,960
h tossing vip or

1322
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:33,839
what is what's going on here

1323
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,800
whatever you don't need the dash h

1324
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,839
all right and then just go to localhost

1325
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,480
4242

1326
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
right

1327
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,279
right here

1328
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,760
and you're connected right what's good

1329
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,559
about linda

1330
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,520
what's good about this

1331
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,000
this isn't running on your laptop

1332
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,160
anymore

1333
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,000
now you can just submit a file

1334
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,040
all right select the file we're gonna go

1335
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,640
ahead and

1336
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,839
i cloned the i cloned this already on my

1337
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,280
laptop so i have the

1338
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,880
test there's test files right

1339
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,200
so we could run a test and just make

1340
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,160
sure that it's

1341
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,200
uploaded so one of the

1342
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,400
issues that i had when uh

1343
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,839
setting up the lab is that we needed to

1344
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,000
update the salary from version

1345
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,920
just basically took the celery version

1346
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
up one because it was like a

1347
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,800
a subpac uh sub dependency that was that

1348
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
was erroring out

1349
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,119
and that needed the one version of

1350
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:53,680
celery

1351
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,200
the 4.3.1 version of celery right

1352
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,480
and you actually have to do

1353
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,599
chmod 777 the storage directory or else

1354
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,079
you can't upload

1355
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,400
from the web interface to have the

1356
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,599
analysis run

1357
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,079
one of the things is that how this pack

1358
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,200
how this is set up

1359
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,480
is that all of the

1360
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,480
vms are sharing a volume on the actual

1361
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,839
main system so you can't spin up 10

1362
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:27,119
servers on lynn node and scale it out

1363
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,480
but it is doable you can scale it out if

1364
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,200
you set up

1365
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,079
volumes on lynn node and then have it

1366
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:34,480
share

1367
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,119
the same volume on all the lynn nodes so

1368
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,720
if you do need to scale them out

1369
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,319
scale them out or turn off lino uh vms

1370
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,760
and turn them back on if you don't want

1371
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,240
to pay the bill

1372
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,720
for having like 10 machines going it's

1373
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,240
just a little bit more

1374
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,160
uh ansible automation that you have to

1375
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,839
do and then just

1376
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,400
map the store so that they all share the

1377
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,960
same

1378
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,480
storage directory but it is doable to

1379
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,880
share the same storage directories all

1380
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,480
right so that they could all write

1381
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,760
um and then after a couple of minutes

1382
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,960
or 25-30 seconds you should see

1383
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,079
a result right and

1384
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,640
right here you click on the results and

1385
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,720
it starts displaying all of the

1386
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,559
the uh json files right so you have the

1387
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,960
report which is basically the

1388
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,640
uh these interface these reports right

1389
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,280
you have some network analysis reports

1390
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,000
some dynamic

1391
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,920
analysis reports that it generates the

1392
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,359
process trees

1393
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,480
all of the uh system calls

1394
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,359
right this is on a test binary let's see

1395
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,240
if we can find

1396
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,880
i think i have a binary available let's

1397
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,799
see

1398
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,759
um that would be in here and

1399
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,359
just take this out

1400
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,079
oh those are pdfs pds pds

1401
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,620
[Music]

1402
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,720
let me see something real quick

1403
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,440
just for one moment i'm gonna just stop

1404
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,839
sharing

1405
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,839
so chad has been your day

1406
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,520
let's see

1407
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,680
do we have any more questions rod

1408
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,799
yes are you seeing iot devices trying to

1409
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,000
own devices

1410
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,640
on your land is there even a market for

1411
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,640
moving sideways

1412
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,680
in a home environment

1413
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,319
um

1414
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,559
i mean we've seen we've seen malware

1415
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,359
do scanning but they usually go out to

1416
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,839
the internet

1417
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:28,720
um we've seen with some of the up and

1418
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,400
proxy research we did

1419
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,240
find that the bad guys were injecting

1420
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,880
nat

1421
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,480
injections into the home devices

1422
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,160
that were allowing them to pivot around

1423
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,000
the firewall and into the land

1424
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,839
and start targeting stuff inside the

1425
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,079
network um

1426
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,599
they were trying to expose smb services

1427
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,599
uh we think for like eternal blue and

1428
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,359
stuff

1429
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,280
but i can't say we've really seen yet

1430
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,920
uh any malware campaigns that have

1431
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,680
gotten caught in our stuff or anything

1432
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,520
that we've dug into

1433
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,160
that once it gets a foothold on the

1434
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,920
router or whatever it's in that it

1435
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,440
starts scanning you know it's

1436
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,799
it's local network for uh lateral

1437
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,240
movement stuff

1438
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,000
i'm sure we will it's only a matter of

1439
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,440
time until we do

1440
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,839
but we haven't yet um

1441
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,440
somebody made a comment on plc slc 500

1442
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,880
know about it or never

1443
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,400
uh i'm unfamiliar with that is that um

1444
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,200
an industrial

1445
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,240
many of the hmis they used are still

1446
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,160
running all windows version

1447
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,720
back in either windows xp um

1448
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,240
and even win win uh ce

1449
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,119
oh he's saying that i guess it's a

1450
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,240
rockwell automation

1451
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,520
yeah i'm not sure exactly uh what

1452
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,599
devices we were looking at when we came

1453
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,160
across the rockwell automation stuff

1454
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,520
that was definitely in like i mean i

1455
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,680
still i still see it when we do scans

1456
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,119
and we start looking at stuff like we

1457
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,319
still see rockwell automation

1458
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,240
occasionally pop up

1459
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,400
um i'd be actually curious if you went

1460
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,079
on showdan right now

1461
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,200
and searched rockwell uh

1462
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,119
what you would find i bet you you'll

1463
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,359
find some devices sitting on the

1464
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,240
internet that are

1465
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,839
handing back a rockwell automation

1466
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,480
banner

1467
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,799
um but yeah alan bradley that's another

1468
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:37,440
one yep

1469
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,839
have definitely seen both of those uh

1470
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:40,559
but i

1471
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,839
don't know if we ever

1472
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,880
attempted to actually identify

1473
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,400
what it was partially because the the

1474
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,000
banner itself only said rockwell

1475
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
automation if i recall

1476
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,200
and i had never heard of rockwell

1477
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,559
automation or alan bradley

1478
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,400
and as part of trying to track down some

1479
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,400
of the stuff that is infected and

1480
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,760
impacted by some of these different

1481
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,880
campaigns and exploits

1482
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,559
um you know digging into the the names

1483
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:10,960
and

1484
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,559
going down the google rabbit hole of

1485
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,000
trying to figure out okay here's the

1486
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,119
model number for this thing

1487
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,400
who makes it what is it uh would result

1488
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,280
in us

1489
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,040
learning about rockwell automation and

1490
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,720
alan bradley and then figuring out what

1491
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,400
we were looking at and how terrifying it

1492
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,599
is

1493
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,839
because you don't know you know is is it

1494
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,520
a nuclear reactor

1495
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,079
is it the city's you know water

1496
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:32,640
maintenance

1497
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,839
systems uh is it some

1498
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,760
industrial furnace for a school you

1499
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,160
don't know

1500
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,319
right uh respond

1501
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,520
uh respect or do you want to continue or

1502
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,079
yeah yeah i was just uh put putting in

1503
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:50,640
some other

1504
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,599
malwares in there to test so this was

1505
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:54,640
another one

1506
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,040
it actually tried to what it did was

1507
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,720
just get a dhcp ip

1508
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,680
address this one didn't do much analysis

1509
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,280
but as you can see

1510
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,359
it you can download the program output

1511
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,839
all right and we could open that up

1512
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,680
uh basically

1513
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,200
a lot of these don't run a lot uh

1514
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
if you get a malware sometimes it might

1515
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,598
just be

1516
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,000
not going to run or nothing's going to

1517
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
happen to it

1518
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,119
if you go and keep if you're testing a

1519
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,079
lot of malwares

1520
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,200
like let's see this one failed right

1521
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,920
and it gives you a reason why it's not

1522
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,559
the right architecture it was a bin file

1523
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,079
so it didn't what so it didn't execute

1524
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,960
so you'll see stuff like that right

1525
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,440
there's uh

1526
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,520
when you're download when you get the p

1527
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,760
caps if you see one that actually has a

1528
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,119
p cap so

1529
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,760
this one didn't have any only had uh

1530
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,200
uh dhcp requests right

1531
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,680
so you can actually see that in the pcap

1532
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,559
if i get the pcap open here and

1533
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,359
share the screen

1534
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,839
the other thing too is if we have the

1535
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:21,760
results.json

1536
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,880
digest that comes out of it i could go

1537
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,079
in there and see if that

1538
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,039
did some sys calls and try and show how

1539
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:29,359
that

1540
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,640
works yeah i'm trying to get

1541
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,359
another pcap file that actually had uh

1542
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,640
better some better

1543
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,079
so in the in the system that we're

1544
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,520
building

1545
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,640
um for the akamai intelligence platform

1546
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,000
stuff

1547
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,319
like one of the example use cases that

1548
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,000
we're working towards and that we'll be

1549
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,400
able to do in the long run

1550
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,280
is going from these you know if we

1551
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,760
detonate a piece of malware

1552
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,640
and that piece of malware outputs to the

1553
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,440
screen

1554
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,000
you know loaded whatever

1555
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,359
trying to look like you know we've seen

1556
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,440
him say like ton tap zero up

1557
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,839
and stuff like that like generic looking

1558
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,119
output

1559
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,119
that's you know the the actors have in

1560
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,039
there to so they know that it's

1561
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,480
successfully executed when they're

1562
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,119
testing it

1563
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,599
and all that good stuff but to an

1564
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:28,880
outside observer it doesn't really look

1565
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,200
like much well all of that stuff goes

1566
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,640
through

1567
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,799
a syscall so in in a

1568
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,640
in a completed system what we'll be able

1569
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,079
to do is

1570
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,680
say okay this particular malware sample

1571
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,160
when we detonate it it's going to output

1572
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,760
this message to the screen

1573
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,359
so now we can go backwards and look

1574
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,920
through all of our results jason's

1575
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,960
and look for cases where the syscall

1576
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,480
that outputs stuff to the screen is

1577
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,000
called and the payload

1578
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,839
that was passed and output to the screen

1579
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,520
is this string

1580
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,280
that will allow us to identify hashes

1581
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,319
we could also do like ssd searching to

1582
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,280
find related or very similar samples

1583
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,119
but from those hashes now we can

1584
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,000
identify a cluster of samples

1585
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,920
and then go backwards all the way until

1586
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,160
we get to honey pots

1587
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,760
or ssh logs or whatever to figure out

1588
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,000
exactly where that sample came from

1589
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,599
and it will give us a high level

1590
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,520
overview of a campaign we can say you

1591
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:29,920
know

1592
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,200
this campaign you know was clearly

1593
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,960
using these exploits it was using these

1594
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,200
command injections

1595
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,119
uh we know that these command injections

1596
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,480
affect

1597
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,920
this modem or this router or this

1598
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,920
device using this cve

1599
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,599
and the functionality of that

1600
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,200
binary is ddos capabilities it can do

1601
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,480
this kind of attack and that kind of

1602
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,920
attack and this kind of attack and the

1603
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,119
attack traffic looks like this

1604
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,280
these are the binaries that were a

1605
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,760
result of that campaign

1606
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,039
and those binaries communicated with

1607
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:09,440
these

1608
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,760
three or four different c2s and now

1609
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,280
these three or four different c2s have

1610
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:13,760
issued

1611
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,000
10 000 commands and 13 of which have

1612
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,400
attacked this customer of ours

1613
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
so having that full pipeline of being

1614
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,440
able to piece that

1615
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,680
together so when a customer says

1616
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,359
hey you know we got hit out of the blue

1617
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,960
yesterday with this huge attack what do

1618
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,319
you what can you tell us about it

1619
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,160
well we can tell you that the people

1620
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,680
that built that botnet started six

1621
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,599
months ago

1622
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,839
and it's been growing steadily and

1623
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,440
they're targeting these things and

1624
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,799
they hit you with this kind of attack

1625
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,240
but we were able to mitigate it because

1626
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,359
it was coming and

1627
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,799
we already have signatures pre-written

1628
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:48,000
for the mitigation specialists to use

1629
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,960
so just to put things into perspective

1630
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,240
as to

1631
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,319
how these different little pieces of

1632
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,520
information and these different little

1633
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,240
pieces

1634
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,640
that leak out of every layer of this

1635
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,680
system

1636
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,839
enable an overall larger intelligence

1637
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,960
operation

1638
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,920
yeah so on this right now on this pcat

1639
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,520
that we're seeing right now

1640
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,920
so the analysis was said was kicked off

1641
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
right and then we got

1642
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,720
uh the analysis actually showed a couple

1643
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,359
of alerts in the analysis

1644
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,599
that it was doing that it was sending

1645
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:22,960
out a bunch of that the binary was

1646
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,359
sending out a bunch of sins

1647
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,839
on this particular malware right we

1648
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,960
looked into it

1649
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,440
on the network analysis and it showed a

1650
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,160
connection

1651
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,960
out to uh three-way handshake

1652
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,760
connections

1653
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,160
a couple of them all right that actually

1654
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,799
complete

1655
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,640
that actually completed and then we

1656
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,160
actually noticed

1657
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,799
that on these signatures here we have

1658
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:45,839
some

1659
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,520
particular handshakes that are that were

1660
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,599
done right

1661
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,480
so we could know that we could put one

1662
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,000
and one together and say oh okay

1663
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,119
here's a communication out to c2s right

1664
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,160
and we're seeing

1665
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,760
handshakes come back so then these

1666
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,240
and that the system is actually looking

1667
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,200
for

1668
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
uh telnet connections out on the

1669
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,799
internet so it's get

1670
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,200
this binary just turned on started

1671
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,480
scanning the internet

1672
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,119
and connecting out and to the c2s and

1673
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,480
what and waiting for

1674
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,960
commands to come back right i believe on

1675
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,720
a couple of these like if there was

1676
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,359
actually

1677
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,760
yeah here you can see that this one

1678
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,559
actually got an acknowledgement back

1679
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,559
right and here's some telnet data from

1680
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,319
that connection

1681
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,440
you can see that it's probably got let's

1682
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,319
try to

1683
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,760
do some uh connections

1684
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,280
there's no talent date on that one

1685
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,240
one i actually saw one that was saying

1686
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,119
oh okay here's

1687
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,720
try to log in all right

1688
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,240
so this is some docs escape way so

1689
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,078
so that's some cable modem

1690
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,920
out on the internet and then the malware

1691
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,400
is trying to probably release it

1692
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,520
and actual connection to it says so

1693
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,799
this one it's probably using like tr069

1694
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:09,359
or whatever

1695
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,799
to abuse stuff but the the other places

1696
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:13,359
where this

1697
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:17,359
kind of intelligence is beneficial

1698
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,960
um is with with mirai

1699
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,158
very early on uh because of

1700
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,679
how the person that wrote the original

1701
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,198
source code and then released it to the

1702
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:30,880
public

1703
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,238
implemented their uh skin skin

1704
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,158
their sin scanning for telnet machines

1705
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,719
basically every mirai node acts as a

1706
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,040
tiny brute forcer

1707
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,399
so while your machine's infected with

1708
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,759
mirai it's not only participating in

1709
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,359
attacks it's also constantly

1710
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,799
scanning the internet in an endless loop

1711
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,560
it's attempting to connect to everything

1712
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,759
on 23 23 23

1713
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,839
um i think those are the two primary

1714
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,279
ports

1715
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,238
and then it once it successfully gets a

1716
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,920
connection back from a device it then

1717
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,520
runs through a list of credentials and

1718
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,520
it attempts to log in

1719
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,600
and sees if it's successfully logged in

1720
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,198
and if it hasn't it disconnects and

1721
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,319
reconnects and does

1722
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,520
another login attempt until it

1723
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,000
successfully connects

1724
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,198
yep exactly nuggets and then it um

1725
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,719
once it identifies that hey i have

1726
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,080
successfully logged in it doesn't go

1727
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,520
through the process of infecting that

1728
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,080
machine

1729
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,719
it reports that machine up to a higher

1730
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,040
level piece of infrastructure

1731
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,839
that piece of infrastructure takes the

1732
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:34,080
confirmed

1733
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,600
if i connect to this machine on this

1734
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,719
port with this username and this

1735
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,799
password i'll be able to connect in and

1736
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,158
infect this thing and then another

1737
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:41,839
machine comes back later logs in with

1738
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:42,799
those credentials

1739
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:45,198
without brute forcing at all and then

1740
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,600
infects that machine

1741
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,839
yeah what's interesting is because of

1742
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,640
how it sets up the handshake

1743
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,080
as part of its scanning there is

1744
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,199
uh a pattern with the device it's

1745
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,159
connecting into

1746
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,920
and some of the characteristics of that

1747
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,159
initial sin packet

1748
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,800
so you can sit back and look at send

1749
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,679
traffic

1750
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,840
as it's hitting your machines sitting on

1751
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,679
the internet and you can identify

1752
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:12,800
other machines that are sitting on the

1753
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,840
internet that are actively infected with

1754
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,400
mirai

1755
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,000
in some cases that's super beneficial

1756
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,320
and having this level of data collection

1757
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,239
from your sandbox not just saying hey it

1758
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,080
talked to this dns and it did this

1759
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,719
but having the actual raw pcaps and

1760
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,880
being able to analyze the raw packet

1761
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,600
data

1762
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,400
that came out of this malware can lead

1763
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,800
to those kinds of discoveries

1764
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,159
so that's yet another reason why lisa is

1765
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:41,360
awesome because it automatically

1766
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,360
captures all this stuff for you

1767
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,960
at some point i did see that it was also

1768
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,320
it pivoted and started to scan

1769
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,320
the internal network as well for devices

1770
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,840
well there you go that answers your

1771
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,320
question i haven't seen that yet

1772
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
yeah because here here we're seeing look

1773
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,239
it's trying to scan

1774
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,360
the internal network the 10 to network

1775
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,520
as well

1776
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,560
10 to 15 uh 10 to 2

1777
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,880
oh maybe that's just the icmp replies

1778
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,560
back

1779
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,320
yeah it's not really scanning the

1780
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,920
internal oh it's just junk

1781
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,040
there's other things here there's it it

1782
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,159
goes out it go

1783
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,679
see as you can see this p-cap goes on

1784
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,840
for a while it's it's six thousand lines

1785
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,960
long

1786
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,040
and that might also just be poor

1787
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,159
programming

1788
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,520
yeah it could just be a bug in their

1789
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,520
scanning code oh here's the

1790
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,040
feedback all right so there's a

1791
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,440
heartbeat message a heartbeat from

1792
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,400
mric too yeah so it was trying to

1793
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,400
communicate out so this is a very

1794
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,920
there's a very interesting pcap to go

1795
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,440
through when you're

1796
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,360
as soon as you get uh your analysis set

1797
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,120
up right actually

1798
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,159
i did see something that was interesting

1799
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,120
or what something else actually

1800
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,120
or was that but

1801
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,520
like in our use case for this we would

1802
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,159
look at

1803
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,360
not just that it's doing the scanning

1804
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,719
and whatever

1805
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,760
that successful communication to and

1806
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,920
from the c2

1807
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,960
um is handy to know it's handy to know

1808
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,000
that this sample communicated to this ip

1809
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,360
on this port and

1810
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,199
great but in the case of mirai

1811
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,520
and in the case of other variants of

1812
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,760
malware actually

1813
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,280
it uses a binary protocol and

1814
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,560
that binary protocol requires a certain

1815
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,320
set of heartbeats and handshakes be

1816
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,840
delivered in a certain order

1817
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,440
with a certain timing uh additionally

1818
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,480
um they pass

1819
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,560
in a string as part of that hand shape

1820
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,640
so you'll see the the binaries detonated

1821
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,920
on the system

1822
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,159
and you know they'll call it you know

1823
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,440
dvr helper

1824
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,760
but then they'll pass a string that's

1825
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,560
you know

1826
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,679
uh punt

1827
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,040
and the c2 itself

1828
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,600
could be identifying that string in the

1829
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,560
heartbeat

1830
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,600
and either responding or not responding

1831
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,840
based on that string being present so

1832
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,520
while a generic

1833
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,400
communications response tells you a lot

1834
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,800
about where it talked to

1835
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,560
looking for that heartbeat

1836
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,640
uh or those standardized types of

1837
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,840
communication

1838
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,880
that you can expect you know if

1839
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,280
if this thing is living on port 23 the

1840
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,400
c2

1841
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,239
but then it's also scanning the entire

1842
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,920
internet for port 23

1843
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,320
how do you find the c2 looking at a list

1844
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,520
of ips that all say port 23

1845
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,000
um well you have to go one step further

1846
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,040
right you have to look at the

1847
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,719
the communication the conversation that

1848
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,960
happened between those devices

1849
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,120
and because it's not sending textual

1850
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,960
data you have to do it

1851
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,760
at a hex level like you want to look at

1852
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,320
the actual bytes of the communications

1853
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,800
and with with mirai you know you see

1854
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,679
null bytes

1855
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,080
are the opening handshake you see a

1856
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,679
couple null bytes

1857
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,880
a handshake payload uh

1858
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,400
you see a time window you've seen all

1859
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,840
bytes returned you've seen all bytes

1860
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,679
returned you've seen null bytes returned

1861
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,440
so looking for those kinds of patterns

1862
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,760
in the resulting pcap

1863
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,199
will be how for example we will identify

1864
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,960
c2s going forward in an automated

1865
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,320
fashion

1866
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,920
so just like we have these sub-analysis

1867
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,840
modules

1868
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,360
we would we will write

1869
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,560
modules that say okay the analysis is

1870
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,360
run

1871
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,960
now it's time for us to analyze this

1872
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,880
pcap like they did a good job telling us

1873
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,440
the dns and telnet and irc that's great

1874
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,560
but we want to identify a c2

1875
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,719
and potentially a family so we may run

1876
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,320
through that pcap data

1877
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,520
and say hey did we see any

1878
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,800
communications where it had these bytes

1879
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,159
in this order and if we did that tells

1880
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,960
us a

1881
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,159
we found a c2 and b what type of c2 have

1882
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,840
we found and then we can report that

1883
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,600
back into the final report

1884
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,560
which we can then use to track in an

1885
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,679
automated fashion

1886
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,840
the c2s that are running these botnets

1887
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,600
so yeah i probably just told you a

1888
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,480
little bit too much about how the

1889
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,080
sausage is made to be honest but

1890
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:39,199
there you go

1891
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,320
uh i think uh there's another question

1892
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,440
here

1893
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,239
are wearables and evs becoming part of

1894
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,199
the iot malware campaigns

1895
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,880
any new attack vectors you want to

1896
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,920
that you've seen for example that you

1897
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,880
are curious about

1898
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,560
i will say if there is a device out

1899
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,080
there

1900
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,000
if it's not part of the attack campaign

1901
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,719
now it probably will be

1902
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,719
so while i cannot point to a positive

1903
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:11,760
case

1904
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,520
where i can say yes this was a wearable

1905
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,120
or this was neevy and and it was

1906
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,239
attacked

1907
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,920
um and this is a game changer

1908
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,679
i would not be surprised to find out

1909
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,760
that there has been one even if i'm not

1910
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,280
aware of it

1911
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,960
and when it does happen i won't consider

1912
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,560
it a game changer at all

1913
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,960
it'll just be more of the same exact

1914
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,840
thing

1915
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,679
um it's just getting its tentacles into

1916
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,199
a newly

1917
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,000
exposed pool of the same old crap that

1918
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,920
we've seen everywhere else

1919
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,719
so here's a question for you guys uh

1920
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:45,920
from me

1921
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,239
do you think that 5g is a game changer

1922
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,480
um you know

1923
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,159
i i don't know i suppose it could be

1924
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,520
i mean you got to think about it like

1925
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,679
this

1926
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,360
when it comes to the ddos trends that

1927
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,840
we've observed over the years

1928
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,199
i remember being at defcon

1929
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,760
probably six or seven years ago and

1930
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,199
there was a talk that i couldn't get

1931
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,800
into uh

1932
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,960
which is you know at def con six or

1933
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,800
seven years ago defcon now you can't get

1934
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,920
into any talk

1935
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,760
uh but six or seven years ago not being

1936
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,360
able to get into a talk was pretty

1937
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,560
impressive

1938
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,239
um and that talk was from

1939
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,159
matthew prince of cloudflare talking

1940
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,600
about how they successfully mitigated a

1941
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,760
325

1942
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,719
gigabit per second attack okay and that

1943
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,760
was like earth-shatteringly large

1944
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,840
it was so large at the time that there

1945
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,960
were a lot of people

1946
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,040
saying that their numbers were wrong and

1947
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,440
their metrics were wrong or whatever

1948
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,960
so nowadays

1949
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,679
um we last year mitigated a 1.4 terabit

1950
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,600
per second attack

1951
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,440
uh for those keeping track at home

1952
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,880
that's about four times larger than what

1953
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,800
the biggest attack was

1954
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,719
that's seven years ago like

1955
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,520
earth-shatteringly large seven years ago

1956
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,040
and this is five times larger

1957
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,840
uh google put out an announcement an

1958
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,360
article about ddos a couple days ago

1959
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,400
and they never publicly disclosed it

1960
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,520
until now

1961
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,080
but they claim that all the way back i

1962
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,520
think in 2017

1963
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,000
so a few years ago they had to mitigate

1964
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,760
a 2.4

1965
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,040
terabit per second attack so it's this

1966
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,560
isn't a coincidence

1967
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,960
that the attacks get larger as the

1968
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:39,679
bandwidth

1969
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,679
gets more prevalent and i think that

1970
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:42,880
that in

1971
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,440
this regard is a game changer because

1972
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,280
the faster i can do anything

1973
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,000
the faster i can do anything right so

1974
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,040
the faster i can stream that 4k

1975
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,080
uh that's the faster that i can

1976
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,520
potentially push that

1977
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,840
amount of attack data out you know if i

1978
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,000
have a symmetrical one gig line coming

1979
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
up and down

1980
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,600
in theory a single user

1981
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,040
could generate a gig per and now you're

1982
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,120
compromising

1983
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,880
oh could you just imagine it's not just

1984
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,440
a gig per you're you're generating a gig

1985
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,760
but you could also be generating a gig

1986
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,960
of

1987
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,360
uh reflection that's using the

1988
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,239
amplifiers

1989
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,840
right well that's that's what i'm saying

1990
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,280
you could be i mean it

1991
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,520
i feel like that that is a game changer

1992
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,000
in that regard

1993
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
um you know we saw

1994
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,280
during during the mariah attacks

1995
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,560
we you know everybody freaked out in

1996
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,040
2016

1997
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,159
because of a 650 gig

1998
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,320
attack and it was you know the biggest

1999
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,480
recorded blah blah blah

2000
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,960
and it shook everybody up uh and the

2001
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,679
reality is

2002
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,760
that those devices that were

2003
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,440
participating in that attack

2004
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,040
we were able to get our hands on them

2005
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,640
and they had a they had a 100 meg

2006
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,719
modem like they couldn't push more than

2007
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,239
100 megs

2008
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,920
if they wanted to um

2009
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,360
had those same devices had a gigabit

2010
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,800
interface

2011
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,040
how much traffic could they push and

2012
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,480
what we're seeing now is we're seeing

2013
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,280
you know

2014
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,400
faster chips getting cheaper and smaller

2015
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,159
being placed in more of this iot stuff

2016
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,199
and the overall specs are going up

2017
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,080
it won't be long until these devices

2018
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,040
have a cheap

2019
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,120
gigabit interface on them it won't be

2020
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,360
long until a gigabit interface

2021
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,520
is connected to potentially a

2022
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,480
multi-gigabit

2023
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,600
link of a consumer device and the amount

2024
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,960
of damage that

2025
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,920
a pool of those things could do could be

2026
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,560
you know

2027
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,600
considerable also look at uh the

2028
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,520
previous research of wirex

2029
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,159
using smartphones as ddos devices as

2030
01:20:58,159 --> 01:20:59,120
well

2031
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,679
you know yeah i mean and that's that's a

2032
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:02,719
perfect case

2033
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,760
you know if your smartphone

2034
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,560
can push traffic we've seen you know

2035
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,000
there are campaigns where we've seen

2036
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,719
these devices get owned

2037
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,440
uh in the yrx case they weren't getting

2038
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,120
they were getting compromised but not

2039
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,000
like

2040
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,639
maliciously you know it's not like they

2041
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,080
had some underlying flaw it was just

2042
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,600
people installing

2043
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,760
free flashlight apps that happen to also

2044
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,560
have ddos capabilities

2045
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,280
so if those devices i don't remember how

2046
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,040
many we found

2047
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,239
i wanted 500 applications

2048
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,000
were removed from the google play store

2049
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,440
for that right

2050
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,040
yeah there was i think it may have been

2051
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,400
more than that they found a ton of

2052
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,600
applications because once

2053
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,440
once you reported it to google then

2054
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,280
google went through

2055
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,000
and started identifying they found a

2056
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,560
trend

2057
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,159
and then they could pivot through the

2058
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,840
play store so we

2059
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,560
had i think 20 or 30 that we knew about

2060
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,239
and i think they told us they identified

2061
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,239
hundreds or thousands

2062
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,679
and they never gave us a straight number

2063
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,679
about how many devices those were

2064
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,040
installed on

2065
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,480
but you know in the future when

2066
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:12,239
every phone has 5g and

2067
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,639
you run into a problem like that that's

2068
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,639
just going to enable that phone to push

2069
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,800
more traffic and

2070
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,159
you know potentially cause more damage

2071
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,760
right you also you also have

2072
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,880
wearables that have now a cell phone

2073
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,560
connection that you wear while you're

2074
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,199
sleeping

2075
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:34,320
or you're doing exercise uh

2076
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,520
so all right i got

2077
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,360
one more question for you guys since you

2078
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,360
guys worked on the internet company do

2079
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,679
you think the internet will be break

2080
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,840
up break

2081
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,760
broken up like looking up like

2082
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,520
anti-trust stuff

2083
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,880
no um i i was still once that

2084
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,800
in an unclassified meeting i have

2085
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,199
somewhere that

2086
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,360
they were expecting a at any time a

2087
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,120
catastrophic attack

2088
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,239
that it would be so bad that

2089
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,080
uh the government will say enough is

2090
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,080
enough that we're not gonna allow

2091
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,360
you anymore to access our military

2092
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:19,199
or government or we're just gonna break

2093
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:19,520
up

2094
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,880
where the uh utilities connect uh

2095
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,960
and we just leave this like you know

2096
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,480
cable tv

2097
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,080
that hasn't happened yet but i've been

2098
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,080
told that they are preparing for that

2099
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,639
what is your opinion i mean you're

2100
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:33,360
talking about

2101
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,080
splitting of civilian and and industrial

2102
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:36,960
yeah

2103
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,960
like people break it up like the like

2104
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,719
you bringing

2105
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:44,159
for example a a university

2106
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,199
or a hospital in china

2107
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,040
or russia it's never going to happen

2108
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,120
again we're just going to break up i

2109
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,159
don't know

2110
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,520
i don't know i mean who knows to be

2111
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,400
completely honest

2112
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,600
i i could make arguments

2113
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,080
against it i can see why somebody would

2114
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,600
want to do it

2115
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,719
um you know we see

2116
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,560
governments disconnect their countries

2117
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,400
themselves whenever there's

2118
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,120
social unrest i remember there was a

2119
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,880
talk at def con a few years ago

2120
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,639
talking about um how to

2121
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:19,840
how to get your message out when the

2122
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
government tries to shut you up or

2123
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,080
something

2124
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,600
and even during like the arab spring um

2125
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,840
they were you know i think uh like in

2126
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,800
libya

2127
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,840
they had cut off the internet and they

2128
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,639
started bouncing satellite signals and

2129
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,639
using ham and stuff

2130
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:43,679
um to to basically go around and

2131
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,760
you know they they had the backbone cut

2132
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,280
so it wasn't like oh you know they

2133
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,440
disabled the dns

2134
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,199
which we've seen them do but it was more

2135
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,960
a case of like

2136
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,480
uh they straight disconnected the

2137
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,080
backbone that connected their country to

2138
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:58,960
the internet so you couldn't get

2139
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,639
anything out

2140
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,000
and they disconnected the mobile

2141
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,760
networks and everything so what people

2142
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,360
were basically doing was

2143
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,120
bouncing off you know low orbit

2144
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,400
uh communication satellites

2145
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,080
and communicating into people that had

2146
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,000
active internet connections elsewhere in

2147
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,840
the world and then those people were

2148
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,520
taking that data and translating it back

2149
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,120
in it was a super slow connection but it

2150
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,800
worked and it allowed

2151
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,280
people to get messages out i think they

2152
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,880
even set up a special twitter account

2153
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,400
for it

2154
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,480
just so you know the people that were

2155
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,040
being shot in the streets by their

2156
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,080
their uh

2157
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,000
i don't know if we call them tyrants or

2158
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,239
what but you know the people that were

2159
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,679
trying to shut them up um were doing so

2160
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:46,719
by force

2161
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:51,040
and i think if they try to

2162
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,480
do something like that there will

2163
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,960
probably be a

2164
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,280
some kind of answer from the populace

2165
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,360
worldwide

2166
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,480
and there's i'll say that there are

2167
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,320
projects that are also geared towards

2168
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:04,639
that

2169
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,080
i think i gave a talk you did actually

2170
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,639
four years ago about the maybe longer

2171
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,639
about the interplanetary file system

2172
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,840
and there's cj dns or c

2173
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,920
c c d j and s i can't remember i can

2174
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,120
never remember that

2175
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,320
um there's a system called i think

2176
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,440
dysporia or something along those lines

2177
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,639
and they're all working towards a

2178
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,639
decentralized system

2179
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,120
uh to where everything's going to be

2180
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,080
encrypted and

2181
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,159
you're essentially relying on your peers

2182
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,360
across the internet

2183
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,120
and you know i mean they're they're even

2184
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,719
going so far as mesh networking and such

2185
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,880
so we'll see

2186
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,719
yeah somebody who just mentioned that

2187
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,840
with all this um

2188
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,159
spacex leo

2189
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,679
uh micro satellites there might be a uh

2190
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,679
even more connectivity but it's it's

2191
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,080
interesting to know

2192
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,360
that they are planning for it well

2193
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,120
they have a plan for it they do yeah

2194
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,239
i i the the opinions i express are my

2195
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:10,560
own

2196
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,800
they are not of my employer or anything

2197
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,840
like that

2198
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,960
um i will say

2199
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,600
that there are powers that be on the

2200
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,040
internet that are already trying to do

2201
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,840
that kind of stuff

2202
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,960
we've seen other powers attempt to do it

2203
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,040
in times of unrest

2204
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:31,040
and you know

2205
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,719
as a staunch libertarian i wouldn't put

2206
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,639
it past them

2207
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:37,679
um but i i also you know

2208
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,440
it's a case of like around and find

2209
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,040
out you're gonna

2210
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,480
what you're going to do is you're going

2211
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,159
to

2212
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:47,679
drive technologies you know the

2213
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,760
the system was designed to be resilient

2214
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,840
against this

2215
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,600
um so as you push towards this

2216
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,360
the system i think

2217
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,440
you know will attempt to defeat this

2218
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:07,840
as well so i think you will see

2219
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,040
these decentralized connectivity

2220
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,239
efforts and like you're talking about

2221
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:16,880
you know it's

2222
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,120
it's fine when you can cut off

2223
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,639
somebody's little

2224
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,639
backbone but if you have uh

2225
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,880
a cluster of satellites like they're

2226
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,600
talking about with the spacex stuff

2227
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,320
um what do you how do you defend against

2228
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,199
that

2229
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:37,440
do you jam the satellites um

2230
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,600
do you i mean i don't know how you

2231
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,800
defend against that

2232
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,639
i don't know if you can jam a satellite

2233
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,120
i'm assuming you can

2234
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,800
well these are micro signal lights so

2235
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,639
there's a lot of them

2236
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,080
i mean they're supposed to they're

2237
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,000
supposed to saturate the

2238
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,440
the low orbit right so that's the thing

2239
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:55,760
you're

2240
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,840
finding it's right there that's your

2241
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,800
space what

2242
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,080
are these micro satellites are they like

2243
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,880
are these like suburban sized satellites

2244
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,600
how how

2245
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,040
are these micro satellites i had no idea

2246
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,239
this is something we're gonna have to

2247
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:11,600
have somebody

2248
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,800
come and give us a a a uh

2249
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,560
a presentation because he said this is

2250
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,000
something new that

2251
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,400
we don't know about it i i truly thought

2252
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,120
when we

2253
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,560
play at the what's his name uh the hack

2254
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,760
the satellite thing

2255
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,360
that we were actually actually going on

2256
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,360
antenna we never used we never

2257
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,719
actually got to play with a real

2258
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,800
satellite but that's something that

2259
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,880
is something that i'm looking at and uh

2260
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,480
probably find somebody that can

2261
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,159
come and give us an explanation because

2262
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:39,360
it's definitely something we need to

2263
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,880
take a look at

2264
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,920
well i think it's also you know like

2265
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,960
if you if you start jamming a satellites

2266
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,199
um what does that mean

2267
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:54,800
to other governments if you know if if

2268
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,199
it's a distributed

2269
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:01,360
network i mean we're already seeing like

2270
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,120
in in terrestrial networks

2271
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,120
uh where one government does something

2272
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,280
and the whole world gets mad at them

2273
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,239
if you were to do something like that at

2274
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,080
a satellite scale

2275
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,440
there would definitely be collateral

2276
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:19,120
damage right so if you're going to be

2277
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,040
blocking or jamming satellite

2278
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,520
communications to shut down this

2279
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,040
this form of communication you don't

2280
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,280
like and it starts to bleed over

2281
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,280
into a sovereign nation next to you is

2282
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,679
that calls for a war

2283
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,080
you know you essentially uh you

2284
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,400
potentially censored a significant

2285
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,719
portion of their populace as well

2286
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:39,920
do they have a right to defend

2287
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,400
themselves

2288
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,560
i don't know here's the here's a bunch

2289
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,000
of weird questions or asked a bunch of

2290
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,440
weird questions that i don't really have

2291
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,199
answers for

2292
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,560
all because of a crockpot yeah

2293
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,960
right this is why we can't have nice

2294
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,280
things

2295
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,280
this is amazing thank you very much

2296
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,199
let's see if they have any other

2297
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,920
um last questions this this was uh

2298
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,440
pretty amazing

2299
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,239
uh if you're gen one another will be

2300
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,239
alone in a minute

2301
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:14,880
uh uh

2302
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,040
yeah we gotta we gotta film saying that

2303
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,719
uh this is this was an amazing

2304
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,360
uh session i agree this was incredible

2305
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,080
um

2306
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,000
and now we need to follow up on the

2307
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,159
start link of the intel it's called

2308
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,600
start link

2309
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,520
so um maybe you guys will come back and

2310
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,520
at one point tell us that about

2311
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,560
satellite

2312
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,960
iot because everything that's connected

2313
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,880
is pretty much getting hacked

2314
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,760
uh well we always found when we were

2315
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,719
doing um even the

2316
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,400
the research into like the mirai and

2317
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,320
other stuff when we started scanning

2318
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,960
a lot of it was like shortwave not

2319
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,560
shortwave but like

2320
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,400
cellular repeaters and um

2321
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,679
like wireless communication device

2322
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:03,520
like industrial enterprise level stuff

2323
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,679
which was concerning as well because you

2324
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,280
know if some

2325
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,639
if some skid from you know wherever

2326
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,280
is able to get in and run their bitcoin

2327
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,239
miner on this

2328
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:17,840
cellular thing then in a wartime

2329
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,320
scenario

2330
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,800
what does that mean for somebody is

2331
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,920
somebody going to be able to come down

2332
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,360
and shut down cellular networks on

2333
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,000
accident

2334
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
or on purpose right and

2335
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,080
it's terrifying keeps me awake at night

2336
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,159
i don't even like to think about it

2337
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,400
it is terrifying well thank you very

2338
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,840
much guys any any last words

2339
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,280
um thanks again this was a pretty

2340
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,880
amazing

2341
