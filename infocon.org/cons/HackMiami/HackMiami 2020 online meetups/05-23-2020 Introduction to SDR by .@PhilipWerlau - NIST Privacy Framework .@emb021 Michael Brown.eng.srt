will continue online at this point

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,330
everybody knows Def Con has been

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,360
canceled it looks like there's going to

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,660
be a bunch of virtual villages there is

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,390
one that recently had a summit which is

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,670
the red team village so if you go to red

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,580
team village that IO or comm you can

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,650
volunteer or submit your talks they

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,650
obviously they have to be related to red

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,540
team there's also some talk about a blue

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,610
team village there will be some villages

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,920
that will be very active and there is

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,700
chatter about an impersonal con it won't

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,940
it won't be official but I'd been

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,010
hearing about a group of people that

26
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,270
they're gonna show up and they're gonna

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,480
do it um not sure the extent of that but

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,990
I seen chatter about it um as far as it

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,210
but then it goes we don't really know

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,240
the CDC doesn't really seem to know

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,510
either we do have a channel where we

32
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,900
discuss what's going on which is the

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,090
current disaster Channel

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,400
we have been then very off from what's

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,590
going on and and what has happened and

36
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,700
there's there's a lot of uncertainty but

37
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,240
there's one thing for certain that they

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,000
said every open its and we don't know

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,470
what's gonna happen I think in the next

40
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,840
two or three weeks or would know should

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,060
things continue like this in Florida

42
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,510
we're probably looking at August for a

43
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,549
comeback on on in-person meetings I've

44
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,110
been told that gyms and all the type of

45
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,260
a

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,590
in person establishments will be opening

47
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,980
in June there is right now a several

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,900
meetings at least in miami-dade County I

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,690
think probably Broward would open faster

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,250
but it looks like once they they let the

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,890
gyms and they let the like martial arts

52
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,170
stuff go bad it will be you know prudent

53
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,819
I would say the wait a little bit and

54
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,360
then we can go back to our to our

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,310
in-person meeting so I would say let's

56
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,959
being conservative we're talking about

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,720
always hopefully you know people won't

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,459
start dropping dead left and right

59
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,739
that's what I'm hoping and and if that's

60
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,109
the case that's that's the month that

61
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,180
we're looking to come back obviously

62
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,599
this was the month of our con con has

63
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,599
been canceled Hope has been canceled as

64
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,459
one New York hope is gonna have I think

65
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,870
is nine days so you may want to look

66
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,190
around and see what they're planning to

67
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,220
do there's a lot of stuff going there to

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,639
this speaking but we'll see if things

69
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,099
don't don't get that's bad and things go

70
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,900
sort of like the Florida way meaning

71
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,519
people just want out of the in pay

72
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,950
attention and it wasn't that bad and I

73
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,950
think things would recover quicker

74
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,859
unfortunately the layoffs are starting

75
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,560
to hit the industry now which is Sur

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,870
about IBM and all they're in other

77
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,560

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,319

levels by the way contract senior junior

84
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,500
and because of the covet which is that

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,269
the interesting thing because of the

86
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,519
covet you actually have the opportunity

87
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,989
to work for companies that would never

88
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,660
even consider because of your location

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,959
so this this is a server lining and what

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,090
is happening right now so so please if

92
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,798
common because I seen it it has affected

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,500

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,169
affect them in some form and I know

95
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,000

and anything - talks to me I know the

100
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,980
this whole time being the glue that is

101
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,790
hard psychologically and and and it's

102
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,840
important to have a interaction we are

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,090
there where were that's 24/7 tour

104
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,670
somebody always in the slack and we are

105
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,650
now testing escort the question are we

106
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,510
moving to this Court I don't know yet

107
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,930
we're gonna run this court parallel or a

108
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,260
while I like the boy stuff I like the

109
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,690
video stuff if this court proves to be

110
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,490
better than slack then eventually we'll

111
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,500
do a switch it would be better slow but

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,720
if you want to join this court let me

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,910
know I'm inviting everybody who wants to

114
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,330
at this point move through or have both

115
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,010
of them I'll suggest you have four for

116
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,730
them right now we ditch eBay so we're

117
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,950
not gonna use kiwis anymore and right

118
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,490
now the CPI 1518 that we're playing a

119
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,970
hack the Hackensack is actually in this

120
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,320
quarter so if you're gonna hack that's

121
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,500
at it 2022 nano and this court that's

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,790
where everything is happening we were

123
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,190
played yesterday I player up 1:00 1:30

124
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,229
a.m. and there speak what's the place

125
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,560
it's a hard severe stop if you want to

126
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,690
learn lift win it I'm sure you have a

127
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,280
lot of fun and then I put more meetings

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,890
we are starting to reach our first half

129
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,870
and now we're gonna have to I'm gonna

130
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,550
start reaching out of people because if

131
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,030
we're not gonna go back yet - in person

132
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,030
will then have to establish meetings or

133
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,669
at least for the foreseeable future and

134
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,729
that will be online so I will be

135
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,350
reaching out some people or if you want

136
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,050
a proposal submitting presentation of

137
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,550
anything and this is your opportunity

138
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,940
the the westcoast part of the the people

139
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,130
at california i liking the fact that

140
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,479
they can see people from the east coast

141
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,380
and vice versa

142
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,650
and same thing with our our chapter in

143
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,680
spain so they're all have this this this

144
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,419
is also another several mining this has

145
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,889
put us all of us together

146
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,009
and because now we can record everything

147
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,240
everybody can see each other so there's

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,159
no more like I wish I could go to tower

149
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,289
40 or I wish I could go to Florida in

150
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,330
fact I think when we go back to

151
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,669
in-person it would be great to somehow

152
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,629
still record it had some sort of a a

153
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,520
remote interaction I don't know how

154
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,229
that's gonna be but we should try it and

155
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:05,939
with that then there's nothing else this

156
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,840
the this day today we have six talks -

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,889
from % 27 in Spain

165
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,080
she'll be presenting about learning

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,659
github so we're expanding and we're

167
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,300
working on bringing more people over and

168
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,169
and hopefully in the future when when we

169
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,789
can go back somehow

170
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,060
we may have a gigantic gathering of all

171
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,740
of us for all over the world we'll see

172
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,240
that's that's my goal and that's the

173
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,759
goal the most of the of all of others

174
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,860
that I know their chapters and hopefully

175
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,379
that will be a chief at one point so

176
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,120
with that in mind I'm gonna leave you

177
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,229
who's gonna go first Phil or Michael I

178
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,659
don't mind going first

179
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:19,949
all right so an amazing guy that is you

180
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,550
know playing with him the DEF CON these

181
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,699
differently a good and great operator

182
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,000
and I if I play CPS I certainly like

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,698
failed to be part of my team and I am

184
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,500
sure that this presentation is gonna be

185
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,789
 awesome so we no further ado

186
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,309
he'll go for it I appreciate the vote of

187
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,630
confidence rod hey guys I'm Phil this

188
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,279
presentation is on software-defined

189
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,190
radio and this is kind of just an

190
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,149
introduction to software defined radio

191
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,690
specifically

192
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,080
radio in general and I'm taking the

193
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,600
approach of someone approaching radio as

194
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,560
a hobbyist or if you work in security

195
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,830
from a security mindset so there's a lot

196
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,050
that I'm not gonna cover there's a lot

197
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,310
of things I'm just gonna scratch the

198
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,610
surface on but I hope this to be kind of

199
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,010
just like your introduction especially

200
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,750
if you're interested in radio as a hobby

201
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,790
I hope by the end of this you'll see

202
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,300
that this is a really good introduction

203
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,300
so Who am I

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,010
professionally I'm a senior security

205
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,350
engineer at vigilant security not really

206
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,360
relevant to radio at all

207
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,270
I'm a licensed technician class two ham

208
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,630
radio operator since 2018 but most

209
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,910
importantly I'm a hobbyist and that's

210
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,350
really the only qualification that I

211
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,850
have coming into radio and really the

212
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,320
only one do you need to have coming into

213
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,370
radio I have been interested in radio

214
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,710
since I was a kid a little story I

215
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,690
remember must have been like fourth

216
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,840
grade someone from our local ham radio

217
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,480
Club came in to speak to us and it

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
fascinated me I wanted to learn you know

219
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,100
how to work with radios how to do ham

220
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,610
radio and at the time there was a

221
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,140
requirement to get an operator's license

222
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,270
that you had to know Morse code so it

223
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,500
always sat in the back of my mind I

224
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,880
never really knew how to get involved

225
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
and it wasn't until years later that I

226
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,980
learned about SDR software-defined radio

227
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,770
and the fact that for as little as $20

228
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,620
you can buy USB dongle off the internet

229
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,730
and get access to a huge portion of the

230
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,880
RF spectrum and that moves to my next

231
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,210
point

232
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,020
why SDR so as I said it can serve as a

233
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,270
really low-cost entry into radio as a

234
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,570
hobby and more importantly it can expose

235
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,970
you to a really large portion of the RF

236
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,000
spectrum so as opposed to maybe entering

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,650
ham radio the traditional way which

238
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,140
would be to buy a physical radio which

239
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,589
would be limited to you know a shorter

240
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,720
scope of frequencies a shorter scope of

241
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,120
applications you can get a bow thing

242
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,760
nowadays a small handheld radio for for

243
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,830
twenty dollars same thing as a an SDR

244
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,390
but you're really only gonna be able to

245
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,680
talk on it

246
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,400
and you're

247
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,360
to the band's so SDR cheap really

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,130
accessible and it also has a really

249
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,340
active community and free and

250
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,930
open-source software it's gonna be

251
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,220
really rare that you're gonna have to

252
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,600
pay for any software related to

253
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,570
software-defined radio and I'll talk

254
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,130
about all of this stuff later on in this

255
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,110
talk but you'll see the resources are

256
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,980
out there to get as to do as basic or as

257
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,520
advanced as you want to get but all of

258
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,720
this assumes that you actually care

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,730
about radio so let me tell you why

260
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,760
should you care about radio it really

261
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
lies at the foundation of all

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,120
telecommunication you know most devices

263
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,160
that you use today are using radio in

264
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
one form or another your cell phone

265
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,810
cellular networks are UHF it's just

266
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,870
radio Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC that's all

267
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,360
just radio satellite communication rod

268
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,220
was talking about hack thus at those

269
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,140
communicates microwave but it's still

270
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,030
radio ok you ban ka-band

271
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,580
and all of these concepts are going to

272
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,100
be the same underlying all of them I

273
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,230
also have car key fobs and garage door

274
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,780
openers you know that's all radio and so

275
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,610
if you're coming from a security

276
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,370
background the OSI model radio sits at

277
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,430
the physical layer the very foundation

278
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,540
you know I talked about Wi-Fi and

279
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,180
Bluetooth those are radio and the the

280
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,430
protocols behind them are radio protocol

281
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,020
so understanding them helps you

282
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,810
understand the physical layer of a lot

283
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,850
of these technology stacks and

284
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,970
additionally even when it isn't radio

285
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,230
let's say you're using something over

286
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,600
the wire like Ethernet the same concepts

287
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,850
apply digital signal processing whether

288
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,000
it's over a wire or over-the-air are

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,470
fundamentally the same

290
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,840
so understanding them gives you a leg up

291
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,250
on understanding what's going on at the

292
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,330
at the lowest level

293
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,310
let me give you a little definition of

294
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,070
what software-defined radio is

295
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,240
technically software-defined radio is a

296
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,010
radio communication system where

297
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,540
components that have traditionally been

298
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,850
implemented in Hardware stuff like

299
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,280
mixers filters amplifiers and modulator

300
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,380
and demodulator x' are instead implement

301
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,190
and implemented by software so I'll talk

302
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,120
a little bit more about what that means

303
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,250
but fundamentally this gives us a lot

304
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,990
more flexibility over what we can do

305
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,210
with hardware a traditional full

306
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,570
hardware radio you have to build out

307
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,880
each part of that radio to your specific

308
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,500
purpose especially your modulator and

309
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,020
demodulator x' and so like an AM radio

310
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,360
and an FM radio are different types of

311
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,240
radios and so they often have both

312
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,710
features but they're fundamentally

313
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,450
different circuits whereas in

314
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,020
software-defined radio that demodulating

315
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,810
takes place in software so so they're

316
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,850
still hardware involved but at the end

317
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,760
of the road you're doing things in some

318
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
software that are traditionally done in

319
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,870
hardware and have a few graph here let

320
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,980
me actually go back jump the gun on that

321
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,090
one I'm gonna go into a lot more detail

322
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,150
about oh dude

323
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,230
screen sharing stop sorry about that

324
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:17,330
guys let me go ahead and again alright

325
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,520
so I have a diagram of what's called a

326
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,680
superheterodyne radio here I'm gonna go

327
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,090
into a lot more detail later on in this

328
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,520
talk but most of these components are

329
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,890
still in a software-defined radio still

330
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:34,140
done via hardware your filters your

331
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,360
amplifiers for your RF and your if'

332
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,250
stage are all done by hardware and it's

333
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,290
only really that demodulation step

334
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,870
that's done in software so as I said

335
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,280
this gives us a lot more flexibility

336
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,630
over what we can do but it does have

337
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,370
some limitations and that mainly has to

338
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,080
do with sample rate again I'll go into

339
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
all of this more detail later on in the

340
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,830
talk but that's at a high level what is

341
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,250
software-defined radio also note this is

342
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,440
different from something like from this

343
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,730
like an uber tooth or a

344
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,510
software-controlled radio where software

345
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,250
is involved and it's controlling radio

346
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,020
as it says but the fundamental

347
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,390
components are not being emulated in

348
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,960
software

349
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,280
they're still being done on hardware

350
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,150
just controlled by software

351
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,010
so let's talk about a few applications

352
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,950
um so software-defined radio is a very

353
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,560
broad topic and the applications are

354
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,420
everything related to radio but as a

355
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,830
hobby these are typically the things

356
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,150
you're gonna see so if you buy a

357
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,529
software-defined radio one of the

358
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,390
simplest things to do is just tune into

359
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,360
the radio AM and FM radio right out of

360
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,760
the box it's super simple to do and it

361
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,200
gives you a really quick and easy

362
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,300
understanding of radio concepts to be

363
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
able to do that and one of the first

364
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,529
things you do when when getting involved

365
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,089
in the details of radio is building your

366
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,790
own AM radio it's pretty simple

367
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,500
the other thing you could do TV tuning

368
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,690
I'll talk later on but that was the

369
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,089
traditional that's why these USB dongles

370
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,470
exist in the first place they're digital

371
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,510
TV tuners that they people just hacked

372
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,800
open to do a lot more than they were

373
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,830
originally supposed to do and so that

374
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,170
you can still use them today ham radio

375
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,630
Sam gave a great talk a few weeks ago on

376
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,050
ham radio and there are a lot of hobbies

377
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,970
and different parts of ham radio that

378
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,220
that are kind of different from SDR it's

379
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,779
a sub section but you can do all of that

380
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,630
through him through SDR you can use a

381
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,490
computer as your front end instead of

382
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,620
using a physical radio I can you know

383
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,570
talk on hand bands with my headset if I

384
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,270
wanted now a little caveat on that in

385
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,160
certain cases depending on your SDR you

386
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,290
might need an UMP convertor the SDR is

387
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,690
some of them don't natively work on the

388
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,310
frequency of the hanpan so I'll talk a

389
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,360
little bit about that later

390
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,709
um airplane trucking ad SB airplane

391
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,450
transponders are radio transponders they

392
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,890
put out messages that you can pick up

393
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,050
and a lot of the flight tracking that's

394
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,110
done is by people just just making their

395
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,220
own raspberry pie you see in the corner

396
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,570
here in this image a Raspberry Pi with

397
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,760
an RTL SDR you can do that to pick up

398
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,740
flight trackers and flight aware

399
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,180
actually sells packages to do that

400
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,280
yourself if you go on flight aware today

401
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,740
you'll see who's who's providing that

402
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,780
data

403
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,040
NOAA weather satellite imagery that's

404
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,630
the actual image that you see up here on

405
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,880
this slide there are satellites in space

406
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,800
that are taking pictures and then just

407
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,900
beaconing out over radio images of them

408
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,880
and you can decode that stuff it's

409
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,130
actually really fun hobby to do and then

410
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,270
the last one I wanted to mention is

411
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,160
foxhunting I'll talk a little bit more

412
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,900
about this too but it's basically

413
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,419
hunting down the source

414
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,749
of where radio broadcast is coming from

415
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,830
I'm gonna talk about this a little bit

416
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,330
more in the scope of the government

417
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,549
doing it but you as a hobbyist can track

418
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,889
down signals and using a computer is one

419
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,629
of the best ways because you have to

420
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:42,299
bring in information from multiple

421
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,789
radios and plot it on a map and it's

422
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:48,909
hard to do that without a computer so

423
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,259
those are just some of the things you

424
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:52,359
can do but this one be hack Miami if I

425
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,980
didn't talk about some of the malicious

426
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,470
applications now I'm gonna be going into

427
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,359
the legality of all of this in length

428
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,669
but you know let's talk about some of

429
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,499
these so the simplest would be jamming

430
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,919
um super illegal but it's basically just

431
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,859
shouting louder than everyone else if

432
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,470
you can put out noise on a frequency

433
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,570
band it can make it difficult for anyone

434
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,669
trying to use that band to receive what

435
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,159
they want to do and it's a pretty you

436
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,940
know easy thing to do also as I said I

437
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,739
mentioned foxhunting you will get caught

438
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:26,789
if you do it static code replay attacks

439
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,769
pretty simple in some very simple

440
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:34,149
applications the the protocol is just a

441
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:37,210
static code that goes off a really good

442
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,359
example of this is I was able to reverse

443
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,419
engineer our doorbell at our office it

444
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,279
uses a static code you record you just

445
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,049
record that signal and play it back and

446
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,239
the doorbell rings and so you'd be

447
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,769
surprised how many devices are

448
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,039
vulnerable to a static code attack

449
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,480
getting more complicated protocol

450
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,429
attacks this is basically like any

451
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,350
vulnerability this this this is more

452
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,940
specific to how the protocol is

453
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,470
implemented and I'm gonna be sewing a

454
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,580
few videos with examples in a moment of

455
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,739
a forward key fob attack so this attack

456
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:10,570
really has to do with the specific

457
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,659
implementations forward fix this but I

458
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:14,980
just kind of put them under an umbrella

459
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,350
of implementation attacks protocol

460
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,980
attacks another relay attacks um

461
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,580
so near field radios if you can extend

462
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,169
them I'm gonna be showing another

463
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,389
example of how a Tesla was stolen by

464
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,840
relaying the key fob it's another simple

465
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,580
attack and then spoofing this is

466
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,429
probably the scariest ones a lot of

467
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:39,309
radio protocols work on faith work on

468
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,869
good faith that you're that you are who

469
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,040
you say you are and

470
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,720
airplane transponders just like we can

471
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,760
receive them you can send them out and

472
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,320
you can lie about who you are and I'm

473
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,700
gonna be showing a pretty scary example

474
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,350
of that too

475
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,670
so here we go let me see if I can get

476
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,740
this to work I'm gonna be trying to use

477
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,780
my mic to my laptop speakers but here's

478
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,460
an example of the four key fob attack

479
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:29,200
from so the video might have been a

480
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,730
little choppy there but basically what

481
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,780
they're showing is that you can use one

482
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,880
of these off-the-shelf radio hardware

483
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,950
and at the time I believe four it has

484
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,690
fixed this but at the time you can use

485
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,450
this to attack a key fob and unlock a

486
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,800
car maliciously pretty scary stuff

487
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,760
here's another one this is the Tesla

488
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,680
attack audio doesn't really matter here

489
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,500
but what you're seeing is two thief's

490
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,480
coming up to a car at night it's Tesla

491
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,370
one of them has a backpack with an

492
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,410
antenna and the other thief is going to

493
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,000
the car and what they're basically doing

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,380
is just relaying the key fob signal so

495
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,880
when you get close to a Tesla picks up

496
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,380
your key fob and unlocks and starts the

497
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,750
car well they're basically just using an

498
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,180
antenna to hop that over to the car and

499
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,160
car thinks that you're that you're there

500
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,760
and so there it is 30 seconds come up to

501
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,290
a car pick it up drive off and then this

502
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,180
is probably the scariest example I have

503
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,800
on here now let's see how well this is

504
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,080
gonna work but this is let me set this

505
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,300
up a little bit this is spoofing a DSP

506
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,130
transponders now this was done in a very

507
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,920
controlled environment but earlier in

508
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,450
this talk this is taken from DEFCON 20

509
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,120
in 2012 they showed that you could spoof

510
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,610
airplane transponders and they they talk

511
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,560
about how even though air traffic

512
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,260
control has primary radar they don't use

513
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,790
it a lot of time and they actually rely

514
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,320
on these transponders as their primary

515
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,880
source of information so if you were to

516
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,650
do this air traffic control and other

517
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,970
planes would see this in real time

518
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:05,029
on me my right by Google Earth's display

519
00:22:05,029 --> 00:23:10,039
that is let's get here basically he

520
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,379
buzzes the tower and this is all just to

521
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:13,730
show you that a lot of these protocols

522
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,399
are relying on just the assumption that

523
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,509
you don't have access to this technology

524
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,789
and you could if you want to do a lot of

525
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,429
damage now you'll get caught as I'm

526
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:24,409
gonna explain in a second but you're

527
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,440
technically feasible so let's talk about

528
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,419
that let's talk about a legality around

529
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:30,860
this and regulators and frequency

530
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,289
allocation so there's two main bodies

531
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,990
that are important to this the ITU the

532
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,509
international telecom Asian

533
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,919
Telecommunications Union they're part of

534
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,090
the UN they're like any UN organization

535
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,789
more about inter-country matters what's

536
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:51,080
more important to us is the FCC the

537
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,669
Federal Communication Commission and

538
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:54,940
they are the ones who regulate the

539
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,159
frequency space and so they control and

540
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,960
allocate frequencies from nine kilohertz

541
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,100
to two hundred and seventy five

542
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,840
gigahertz and see the map on here

543
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,639
obviously you can't read anything but

544
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,799
look it up if you're interested on what

545
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,820
they allocate you turn of these

546
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,790
frequency spaces for

547
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,380
and let's talk a little bit about how

548
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,710
they allocate that in some cases uh

549
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,260
you know it's it each each space is

550
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,170
allocated by a use but you also have

551
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,350
users so you have spectrum licenses

552
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,820
cellular networks you'll often hear

553
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,650
about spectrum auctions that happen one

554
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,590
happened I believe happened in 2008

555
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,870
where they auction off a large part of a

556
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,630
spectrum to a specific provider who is

557
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,390
going to be using that so Verizon AT&T

558
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,450
they auction for spectrum space the

559
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,250
other thing is another spectrum license

560
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,630
is called a broadcast license this is

561
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,800
probably what you're a lot more familiar

562
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,990
with am/fm radio stations TV radio

563
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,300
stations they have their call signs and

564
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,220
stuff like that they're allowed to

565
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,260
broadcast in a certain frequency space

566
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,460
by only geographically please then you

567
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,570
have something called the universal

568
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,540
license system people like ham radio

569
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,550
operators who get call signs they are

570
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,540
part of this airplanes boats and then

571
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,770
general mobile radio service is another

572
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,890
one all of these you have to register

573
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,120
with the FCC you're not giving an

574
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,240
exclusive use of a spectrum space but

575
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,740
you're allowed to be a user on there you

576
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,090
just have to register and identify

577
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,150
yourself and so as a ham radio operator

578
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,460
when I register I have to get my address

579
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,960
and so it's why I don't give my callsign

580
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,730
all the time is because you could find

581
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,640
out where I live just from my call sign

582
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,020
and then the other one is unlicensed

583
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,730
bands now that doesn't mean unregulated

584
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,150
there are still you know rules regarding

585
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,470
what you can do on these bands but you

586
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,270
don't have to register with the FCC to

587
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,200
transmit on these bands CB radio is a

588
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
good example

589
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,700
FRS Family Radio Service and then the

590
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,050
one that we really care about which is

591
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,370
the industrial scientific and medical

592
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,350
bands iossef ants and I'll talk at

593
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,010
length about those a little bit one note

594
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,050
just talking about that ham radio

595
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,540
operator uh the Universal licensing

596
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,430
system allows you to look up the call

597
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,070
sign of anyone in this case is a famous

598
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,690
astronaut I'm not giving away any you

599
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,340
know information that isn't already out

600
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,190
there but you know by your callsign you

601
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,990
can find out who and where they're

602
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,090
broadcasting from but so you have to

603
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,450
register enforcement I talked a little

604
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,500
bit about fox hunting before

605
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,429
the FCC regularly monitors RF space they

606
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,000
have bands that are you know decked out

607
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,789
with RF equipment that can monitor a lot

608
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,360
of you know transmissions and they

609
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,490
commonly hunt down pirates and so this

610
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,529
is a warning don't transmit on a band

611
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,149
you're not supposed to the FCC will find

612
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:46,240
you and they will find you so while

613
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,860
technically you can get into a lot of

614
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,659
trouble people are watching and they

615
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,059
will come find you so just keep that in

616
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:52,480
mind

617
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
so the isn band's industrial scientific

618
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,370
and medical bands these are portions of

619
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,240
the radio spectrum that are

620
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,080
intentionally left open mostly because

621
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,269
there are other sources of frequencies

622
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:07,000
in these spectrums that they can't

623
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,980
really control for example your

624
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,159
microwave gives off 2.4 gigahertz it's

625
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,630
why that part of the spectrum is open

626
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,059
and so they acknowledge that you know we

627
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:17,940
need to have microwaves there's gonna be

628
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,529
noise and that part of the spectrum so

629
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:22,380
they opened it up and basically said

630
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,760
listen you can use that spectrum for

631
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,289
what you want just being you know

632
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:27,490
acknowledge that there's gonna there's

633
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,710
potentially a lot of noise there so you

634
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,149
have to be susceptible to interference

635
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,360
from other devices but this is why a lot

636
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,159
of applications are out there because

637
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,260
you don't have to register with the FCC

638
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,750
now I say register I'll show you in a

639
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,940
second you still have to be tested that

640
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,230
your device isn't putting out other

641
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,639
stuff so you still have to kind of

642
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,620
register with the FCC P C but they don't

643
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,450
need call signs for every single device

644
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,269
that goes out there so Wi-Fi works over

645
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:54,880
to 2.4 gigahertz it also works over 5

646
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,200
gigahertz you'll notice here the entire

647
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,720
5 megahertz band isn't covered and so

648
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,000
this these applications don't

649
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,860
exclusively work over these bands but

650
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,710
historically they did for just ease of

651
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,510
use but you'll find a lot here Wi-Fi

652
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,519
Bluetooth NFC cordless phones if anyone

653
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,830
remembers what those are garage door

654
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,100
opener as baby monitors the nice thing

655
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,110
and why this is important to us is these

656
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,850
we have a lot more freedom over these

657
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,279
bands since they're unlicensed you can

658
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,260
transmit with some you know there are

659
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,850
some restrictions but you can you can

660
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,289
play around on these bands without

661
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,559
having the FCC come knock down your door

662
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,730
I'll talk about a little bit about the

663
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,039
ID lookup so these devices do need to be

664
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,710
registered with you FCC so that they can

665
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,940
check that they're not putting on

666
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,320
anything they're not supposed to but

667
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,990
that gives us a really useful resource

668
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,059
especially as hackers if you want to see

669
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,620
what frequency a device is giving off

670
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,840
let's say find your key fob for your

671
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,760
your car or your garage door opener and

672
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,110
turn it around you will find one of

673
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,690
these IDs and you can go on the FCC's

674
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,539
website and look up what frequency does

675
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,460
it operate on and they even have in this

676
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,529
detailed exhibits pledge you know well

677
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,029
I'm at I'm gonna have the user's manual

678
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:02,860
that is really useful some of the times

679
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,230
for you know finding information useful

680
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,059
information about a device just from the

681
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,470
idea on the back so most of what I've

682
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,270
been saying about legality is about

683
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,279
transmitting and that's really where you

684
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,740
have to be careful with radio but that

685
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,600
doesn't mean there are no regulations

686
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,440
around receiving generally you're okay

687
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,850
about receiving stuff but there are a

688
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,200
few caveats so there's something called

689
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,880
the interception divulgence of radio

690
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,700
communications act basically says that

691
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,830
you can't use radio to your own benefit

692
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,770
and they give a few examples taxi cab

693
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,029
company intercepting radio

694
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:38,950
communications from a rival dispatcher

695
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:43,020
to get an advantage intercepting like on

696
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,289
unencrypted TV signals and reselling it

697
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,240
recording people's you know

698
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,679
conversations over radio and trying to

699
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:51,730
use that to your advantage

700
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,700
stuff like that also it's illegal to

701
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,590
decrypt anything that's encrypted if

702
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,289
there is encrypted communications don't

703
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,130
try and decrypt it

704
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,960
that is illegal any communication that

705
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,000
is encrypted it is illegal to try and

706
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,309
decrypt if you're not authorized to a

707
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,460
note about this if you're a ham radio

708
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,620
operator it is you're not allowed to

709
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,210
encrypt any of your communications

710
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,440
that's part of being a ham radio

711
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,770
operator so you likely won't see a lot

712
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,179
of encryption but if you do don't try

713
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,289
and crack it because you can get in

714
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:25,210
trouble for it I'm gonna go over a few

715
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,360
basics radio concepts that are important

716
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,580
so a lot of you might already know a lot

717
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,950
of this stuff basic trigonometry stuff

718
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,830
sine waves there are three main aspects

719
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,240
to a sine wave if you have its amplitude

720
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,940
right in this case it's how much power

721
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,909
measured in DB you have its frequency

722
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,100
you know the period at which it goes

723
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,860
over and you have its phase phases a

724
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,179
little bit more complicated but it's

725
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:49,630
basically

726
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,580
just where it is relative you know the

727
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,210
shift of the wave these are the three

728
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,580
aspects of a sine wave that are

729
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,830
important and when we get to modulations

730
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,420
these are basically the three places

731
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,790
that you can encode data with but they

732
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,910
are all important concepts another one

733
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,290
in ser is called the Fourier transform

734
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,600
this is a mathematical concept that you

735
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,970
can take any complex waveform and

736
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,520
decompose it into its simple waveforms

737
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,610
and so waves will interfere

738
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,680
constructively and destructively and

739
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,570
you'll see this wave up here at the top

740
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,730
it's kind of messy but any messy

741
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,530
waveform like that can be decomposed

742
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,400
into a series of simple waveforms this

743
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,650
is a really really powerful concept in

744
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,380
radio you'll see it a lot here I have

745
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,660
two images up here but FFT plot of a

746
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,610
where you can see kind of instead of the

747
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,350
waveform itself you can see what are the

748
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,690
frequencies that make it up and another

749
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,130
picture here at the top left which is a

750
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,230
waterfall plot and those are those

751
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,390
frequencies over time so this is one of

752
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,000
the big powerful uses of

753
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,770
software-defined radio is of giving you

754
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,990
this kind of broad view of the radio

755
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,790
spectrum over time and over frequencies

756
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,190
let's talk about a few radio components

757
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,990
we talked about amplitude an amplifier

758
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,550
is something that just increases the

759
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,950
amplitude in a lot of cases it's you

760
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,840
know all frequencies but if you pass it

761
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,460
through a filter at some frequencies and

762
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,310
it's just a simple idea you're just you

763
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,410
should be you know we all know what an

764
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,330
amplifier is it increases you know sound

765
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,210
on a radio or on your speakers you're

766
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,240
just turning up the volume filters we

767
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,430
talked about it a Fourier transform

768
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,650
about how you can spread out your

769
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,230
frequencies filters just block out some

770
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,310
of those frequencies so you have a

771
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,430
low-pass filter which lets all of the

772
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,370
frequencies below a certain threshold

773
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,420
high-pass filter lets all the

774
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,590
frequencies above a certain threshold

775
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,300
and your bandpass or band stop filters

776
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,700
which basically just they allow either a

777
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,950
certain portion of frequencies or reject

778
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,870
a certain portion of some basic ideas

779
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,360
but they're they're powerful and then

780
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,510
you have a mixer which is basically just

781
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,430
an oscillator you create

782
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,530
simple waveform and you add it to

783
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,260
another waveform so it's basically just

784
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,840
adding together two waveforms and this

785
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,830
is often used to shift the frequency so

786
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,880
you can I'll explain a little bit about

787
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,070
a superheterodyne radio and why this is

788
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,650
so powerful before I get there though I

789
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,450
want to make I want to talk about

790
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,950
baseband and carrier waves so a baseband

791
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,780
refers to the actual data that you carry

792
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,360
care about in terms of audio that would

793
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,910
be the speech the actual you know audio

794
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,670
that I'm making and for a human voice

795
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,830
example for human hearing that's around

796
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,350
20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz but there's a

797
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,830
problem

798
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,200
um radio waves at that low of a

799
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,730
frequencies are really difficult to deal

800
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,140
with your antennas are going to be huge

801
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,770
it's just it's very cumbersome so what

802
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,600
we want to do is we want to take this

803
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,750
this lower frequency information in this

804
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,910
case audio and encode it onto a higher

805
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,370
frequency waveform that we can transmit

806
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,490
so for example AM radio functions at

807
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:11,469
around 500 to 1500 kilohertz and through

808
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,050
modulation we can take this information

809
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,290
and encode it onto a courier and so we

810
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,929
see here two examples one is of analog

811
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,969
modulation in another of digital I'll

812
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,860
get more in detail about different types

813
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,989
of modulation later but the basic idea

814
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,909
is that you're you're you're encoding

815
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,920
one piece of information on another and

816
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,409
one carries it know with all of that

817
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,389
other way let's talk a little bit more

818
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,489
in detail about how a software-defined

819
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,040
radio works and more generally

820
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,000
software-defined radio is just a

821
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,909
superheterodyne radio which most radios

822
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,780
are so what is a superheterodyne radio

823
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,840
the basic idea behind it is that you

824
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,090
want to be able to tune and isolate a

825
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,490
single frequency or range of frequencies

826
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,750
it's a band of frequencies and this

827
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,940
makes sense think about an FM radio you

828
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,770
have a dial and you can turn it to the

829
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,230
station you want and you only hear that

830
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,490
one station and there are multiple

831
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,830
stations side-by-side that's the basic

832
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,700
idea now we could do this by having a

833
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,020
dynamic filter having a

834
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,300
that has the ability to change which

835
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,580
frequencies it filters out but those are

836
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,170
expensive they're complicated to make

837
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,290
what makes a lot more senses to have a

838
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,610
filter that works for a specific range

839
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,160
of frequencies is fixed and to use a

840
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,470
mixer as we talked about to shift the

841
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,300
incoming frequency around that fixed

842
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,040
filter and this is how most radios work

843
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,330
and so we can see back to this diagram

844
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,190
the superheterodyne receiver and i'm

845
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,720
going to show in more detail how this

846
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,090
works but this this screenshot by the

847
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,850
way is a screenshot of the hack RF

848
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,830
showing that in in in hardware is

849
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,470
implemented these components so let me

850
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,310
go to the next page we can see that we

851
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,170
have the antenna up here at the top at

852
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,670
the top right we have an antenna and a

853
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,790
whole mix of frequencies the first thing

854
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,560
we do is we're gonna filter out a

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,990
certain range there are some technical

856
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,370
details I'm not getting into why you

857
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,040
have to do this called an image but we

858
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,600
start with one filter and filter it down

859
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,620
into what are called the intermediate

860
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,980
frequencies we then shift these down and

861
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,870
this is the movement that I was talking

862
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,120
about that moves the frequencies we care

863
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,190
about to the frequencies that the filter

864
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,710
works at and you can see here the second

865
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,290
filter is filtering out just that one

866
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,940
frequency so through these three steps

867
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,920
we go from the entire radio spectrum

868
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,140
down to just the one frequency that we

869
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,750
care about and as I said this is how

870
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,060
most radios work and specifically

871
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,100
software-defined radios and so in this

872
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,310
diagram on the left this is showing an

873
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,220
analog radio in the case of an SDR this

874
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,720
part right here called the product

875
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,190
detector and the beat frequency

876
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,070
oscillator this is just what's doing

877
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,400
demodulation for an AM of radio this

878
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,530
would be implemented in software but the

879
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,760
rest of this picture just like in a

880
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,350
normal radio is all going to be done in

881
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:07,260
hardware so it's controlled by software

882
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,400
there's another really important concept

883
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,140
and this really comes to the heart of

884
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,150
software-defined radio and that's the

885
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,080
idea of sampling what we've been talking

886
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,690
about is analog signals but a computer

887
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,760
works on digital information and the

888
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,140
difference between that is one is

889
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,990
continuous and one is discrete and what

890
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,450
does that mean that means a radio signal

891
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,160
has a value at literally every single

892
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,730
POI

893
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,230
you can zoom in further and further in

894
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,730
time and it's gonna have a value there

895
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,119
but computers work in discrete chunks

896
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,530
you have a clock speed on your computer

897
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,570
you know 2.5 gigahertz 5 gigahertz

898
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,150
whatever it is it's working at a certain

899
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,430
frequency and what comes to a digital

900
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,810
signal processing you have what's called

901
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,270
an analog to digital converter which

902
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,250
basically just takes a measurement at a

903
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,080
certain frequency in time and you can

904
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,820
see here you come in with a continuous

905
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,740
signal and what comes out is a

906
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,070
measurement at a certain time and so it

907
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,930
gives us a good approximation that wait

908
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,020
but it's an approximation and that comes

909
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,109
with some caveats and this next page is

910
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:14,530
gonna show one of those so there's an

911
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,990
issue in software-defined radio or any

912
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,250
digital signal processing called

913
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,590
aliasing and that's what happens when

914
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,810
you're trying to sample something at too

915
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,420
slow of a rate for the frequency so at

916
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,940
the top we can see a wave that's being

917
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,400
sampled at a proper sample rate we're

918
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,050
getting enough information to properly

919
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,210
show what the wave would look like and

920
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,530
we can see that by each one of these

921
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,570
circles where this line the sample

922
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,109
interval intersects the wave we get a

923
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,109
value but if that frequency is too high

924
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:47,380
we're gonna get a bad image of what that

925
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,660
freak that waveform looks like

926
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,450
all right hopefully you guys can still

927
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,890
hear me I think my headset just turned

928
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,539
off so um the point about this is that

929
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,249
you have to have your sample rate match

930
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,809
your frequency otherwise you're gonna

931
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,339
get some artifacts and it is gonna

932
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,529
confuse your whole system by making it

933
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,599
think that a different waveform is

934
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,799
coming in that's actually coming in

935
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,479
another important concept in

936
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,829
software-defined radio is called

937
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:28,670
in-phase and quadrature also called IQ

938
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,489
this is a pretty complex idea but simply

939
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:34,559
the idea is that you take a single

940
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,940
waveform and you turn it into two you

941
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,249
duplicate it and shift one 90 degrees

942
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:44,539
out of phase the reason this is done is

943
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:46,440
twofold

944
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,440
one phase of a wave or at least when

945
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,390
doing phase modulation it's incredibly

946
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,369
difficult to tell what the phase of the

947
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:57,049
wave is and to doing this makes

948
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:00,180
modulating signals a lot easier so it's

949
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,410
a complex idea I'm not gonna get too

950
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,059
into it but just keep in mind that

951
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:05,130
signals coming in and when

952
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,599
software-defined radio come in as two

953
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,119
values and I in a queue and it's mainly

954
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,670
just done for convenience sake and then

955
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,099
we get to a really important concept

956
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,430
modulation so I spoke before about the

957
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,799
different aspects of the sine wave

958
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,660
amplitude frequency and phase these are

959
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,299
the three attributes you have to work

960
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,529
with when you want to encode information

961
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:33,299
in radio signals the baseband the

962
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:34,650
information you want to encode is either

963
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,420
gonna come in one of two forms it's

964
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,150
either gonna be analog audio like this

965
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,690
is analog or a digital which you know we

966
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,549
have examples here on this picture of

967
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:49,140
analog and digital waveforms and each

968
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,549
one of these comes different forms of

969
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,559
modulation so for amplitude you have

970
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,170
amplitude modulation when you have a an

971
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,910
analog signal in an analog carrier what

972
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,710
you get looks like this results on the

973
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,190
bottom left and so as time goes on your

974
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,420
amplitude goes up and your amplitude

975
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,880
goes down and that change in amplitude

976
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,970
is where our information

977
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,470
now when we get to digital information

978
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,630
we have what's called shift key and in

979
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,370
the case of amplitude it's called

980
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,800
amplitude shift keying um there are

981
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,720
multiple types of it one it's called

982
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,930
on-off keying this is gonna be the most

983
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,890
common example and I'm gonna show

984
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,830
examples of these in a little bit but

985
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,260
it's basically is there are signal or is

986
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,940
there not a signal and that encodes our

987
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,920
information we can do the same with

988
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,550
frequency

989
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,680
we can do frequency modulation either

990
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,720
with an analog signal or frequency shift

991
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,300
key and we can do the same thing with

992
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,890
phase now that's not as easy to show

993
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,820
here but the point stands we can encode

994
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,830
information by varying any of these

995
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,710
attributes and we can do it either with

996
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,330
the analog information or digital

997
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,910
information and then something that I'm

998
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,260
not gonna get too much into but it's

999
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,480
important talking about IQ there's

1000
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,980
something called quadrature modulation

1001
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,990
now you're still working with these

1002
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,850
three basic parameters amplitude

1003
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,640
frequency and phase but you're doing it

1004
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,640
through your IQ samples this is

1005
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,770
important because stuff like Wi-Fi works

1006
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,950
over quadrature amplitude modulation I

1007
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,290
might get into that more in a future

1008
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,060
talk but just keep in the back of your

1009
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,620
mind that that's for advanced

1010
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,480
technologies like Wi-Fi that is the

1011
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,150
modulation type that's used and then

1012
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,650
there's an important concept here which

1013
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,590
is the idea of bitrate and error rate so

1014
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,380
going on to the next page I have an

1015
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,110
example here at the bottom that when

1016
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,410
doing shift keying you can have it be

1017
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,100
binary either a 0 or 1 or you can encode

1018
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,190
more information by choosing different

1019
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,140
steps so we can choose here in these

1020
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,200
bottom two examples you can either have

1021
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,910
a signal on or off or you could have a

1022
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,410
signal at 1.5 or 0 and so how many

1023
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,000
intervals of frequency of amplitudes you

1024
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,760
use will give you how many how many

1025
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,590
bytes how many bits you can fit in there

1026
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,630
but the trade-off for that is that

1027
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,460
there's a possibility of error rate so

1028
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,620
it's a lot easier to tell if your radios

1029
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,050
on or off vs. is it a hundred percent

1030
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,670
power 50 percent power and zero percent

1031
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,730
power so there's a trade-off between

1032
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,740
your bit rate and your error rate just

1033
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,000
keep that in mind

1034
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,770
and so here on the screen I have a

1035
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,440
little bit of an example between at the

1036
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,970
truth shifting and frequency shift key

1037
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,680
actually this is not frequency shifting

1038
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,120
I'm sorry this is frequency modulation

1039
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,980
but these are examples of different

1040
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,660
modulation schemes and how they appear

1041
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,970
on the waveform so with all of that

1042
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:45,690
let's talk a little bit about hardware

1043
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,550
and and the kinds of hardware that's out

1044
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,920
there for consumers there's a few things

1045
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,840
that you need to be mindful of when

1046
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,330
picking a software-defined radio chipset

1047
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,900
is important there are multiple DSPs and

1048
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,690
and a tax ID analog to digital converter

1049
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,270
chipsets out there I'll talk about a few

1050
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,590
of them but the most important reason

1051
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,140
it's important is the drivers related to

1052
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,280
them is going to dictate the kind of

1053
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,690
software you can use so just keep that

1054
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:14,490
in mind in some cases the chipset for

1055
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,230
the analog to digital converter is

1056
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,450
separate from the tuner I'll show that

1057
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,680
with the rtl-sdr

1058
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,320
but just keep in mind the tuner at least

1059
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,060
the hardware components as we talk with

1060
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,670
superheterodyne receiver those front

1061
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,490
parts the RF and the if' stage could be

1062
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,560
separate from the the software-defined

1063
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,980
radio chipset and that will dictate you

1064
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,720
know your frequency range and stuff so

1065
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,970
the chipset for the the DSP is gonna

1066
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,820
dictate your sample rate and the the

1067
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,530
chipset for your tuner is gonna dictate

1068
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,290
your frequency range also keep in mind

1069
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,020
um the difference between receiving and

1070
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,710
transmitting you know the RTL SDR right

1071
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,840
here only does receiving it's 20 dollars

1072
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,370
but you can only receive you're gonna

1073
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,960
need something more expensive like a

1074
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,180
hack RF or a blade RF if you if you want

1075
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,970
to do transmission um and when it does

1076
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,470
come to transmitting there's a

1077
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,700
difference between half-duplex and

1078
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,050
full-duplex and basically what that

1079
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,480
means is whether you can transmit and

1080
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,070
receive at the same time or not and then

1081
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,260
here's the big the two big ones that are

1082
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,300
really gonna dictate the price between

1083
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,230
SD ours is the noise in the clock um

1084
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,780
noise how susceptible it is to noise how

1085
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,150
well it's built how well every part is

1086
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,040
built to be susceptible to noise is

1087
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,040
going to dictate how weak of a signal

1088
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,290
you can receive for a lot of

1089
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,510
applications to get into it not gonna

1090
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,560
matter too much

1091
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,440
digital protocols can kind of deal with

1092
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,330
noise but as you get higher into the

1093
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,190
hobby that's you know getting your noise

1094
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,870
down is where where it gets expensive

1095
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,610
and then the other one is your clock um

1096
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,950
having a consistent clock especially a

1097
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,520
very high frequencies you know having a

1098
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,770
oscillator that shifts and isn't perfect

1099
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,230
is gonna have an effect and so as you

1100
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,180
get you know up there in price you're

1101
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,630
gonna have better tempered oscillating

1102
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,900
crystals that just keep the time better

1103
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,190
and then a really important thing this

1104
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,230
isn't really about the hardware of the

1105
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,660
the SDR but of the entire setup that you

1106
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,240
have be mindful that your USB interface

1107
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,900
matters a lot and this really comes into

1108
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,090
play when you're dealing with VMs trying

1109
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,590
to do software-defined radio through a

1110
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:26,340
VM is asking for trouble there you're

1111
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,160
just adding extra you know links in the

1112
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,560
chain and I just from experience I've

1113
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,240
had trouble with it so try and do it on

1114
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,430
bare hardware and be mindful that the

1115
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,440
difference between USB 2 and USB 3 and

1116
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,220
in certain applications will matter so

1117
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,020
with that let's get a little bit into

1118
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,270
the history of it so this really started

1119
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:50,040
with the rtl-sdr um the RTL 2832 chipset

1120
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,550
made by realtek was built to demodulate

1121
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,970
TV signals they originally just built as

1122
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,120
a TV tuner but they also added a mode to

1123
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:06,030
be able to do RF sorry I'm FM radio and

1124
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,450
they did it through IQ samples and while

1125
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,280
one of the Linux developers was

1126
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,930
developing drivers for this device he

1127
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,430
discovered that this device was capable

1128
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,350
of a lot more than what they marketed

1129
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,110
for so it could do more than just TV and

1130
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,290
FM radio it could do a huge range of

1131
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,120
frequencies and they unlock them this is

1132
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,860
really what sparked the consumer SDR

1133
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,430
craze is the RTL SDR and unlocking this

1134
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,170
chip now since then a lot of chips have

1135
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,970
come out but this is really the

1136
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,550
granddaddy of them and especially when

1137
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,460
you talk about compatibility a lot of

1138
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,680
software support specifically this

1139
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,770
chipset and the drivers around it a

1140
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,510
little bit about that sample rates are

1141
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,240
capable of up to about 3.2 million

1142
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,400
samples per second you'll see a sample

1143
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:50,970
rate sometime

1144
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,070
in samples per second sometimes it hurts

1145
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,940
they're basically interchangeable

1146
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,320
realistically you're talking about 2.8

1147
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,690
million symbols per second or about 2.8

1148
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,200
megahertz of a sample rate frequency

1149
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,170
again this is just the chipset and so

1150
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,760
you'll see a lot of the time the actual

1151
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,830
tuner that goes along with this will

1152
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,360
change depending on who's producing

1153
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,890
these devices and I've listed a few of

1154
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,690
the most common ones but you'll see the

1155
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,670
frequency ranges change and some point

1156
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,890
as much as double the high-end frequency

1157
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,300
that you can reach it in some cases it's

1158
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,220
double so be mindful of that when you

1159
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,040
when you go out and buy SDR you might

1160
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,790
see these two chipset numbers RTL 2832 -

1161
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:34,260
you know e 4000 that's what that's

1162
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,990
referring to so this is a really common

1163
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,480
implementation rtl-sdr comm is a really

1164
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,940
great resource but they also make their

1165
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,130
own implementation on this device and

1166
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,100
I've highlighted a few STRs here just to

1167
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,180
give you an example but they're capable

1168
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,700
of this one very interesting I didn't

1169
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,930
actually know this until I did research

1170
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,060
through this presentation

1171
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,860
they're capable of going down to HT

1172
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,530
bands I'm sorry HF bands meaning you

1173
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:59,790
could do ham radio with this out of the

1174
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,940
box really nice I and that didn't used

1175
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,050
to be the case and I don't think that's

1176
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,270
an a you know a standard feature of

1177
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:12,230
these but very nice it is receive only a

1178
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,890
few other things

1179
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:18,540
8-bit IQ samples USB 2 and it has an SMA

1180
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,240
adapter that rtl-sdr is very similar to

1181
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,180
this it's my first SDR that I bought

1182
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,570
years ago and it has a different

1183
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,430
connector on it but a lot of these are

1184
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,990
capable of very similar things but the

1185
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,370
point is this is probably where you want

1186
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,660
to start there twenty to twenty-five

1187
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,770
dollars for really great entry into SDR

1188
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,210
going up a little bit more you have the

1189
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:42,090
hack RF one this is made by Great Scott

1190
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,170
gadgets this is a really great device -

1191
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,430
what's really nice about this is it

1192
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,740
allows for transmission as well it is

1193
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,390
half duplex but it does allow for

1194
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,240
transmission um the range on these is

1195
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,160
about thirty megahertz to six gigahertz

1196
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,680
so a higher in the high end allowing for

1197
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,800
Wi-Fi frequencies but you can't go down

1198
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,240
to the Han frequencies at least not with

1199
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:03,870
a

1200
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:09,630
converter USB to SMA connector also this

1201
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,960
one's about $300

1202
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,570
another common SDR is called the blade

1203
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,950
RF has a probably the best range of them

1204
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,960
all but it's also the most expensive

1205
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,430
this allows for full duplex it has a

1206
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,850
higher sample rate is USB 3 the cool

1207
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,250
thing about this has 4 antennas so

1208
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,300
there's a lot you can do with these

1209
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,010
devices now I'm just scratching the

1210
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,630
surface here I'm gonna throw out a bunch

1211
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,270
of other STRs here that run the gamut

1212
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,580
you can see at the top the Flex 6600

1213
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,190
that's like a serious ham radio SDR

1214
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,570
those things start at five thousand

1215
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,730
dollars so you can you can really go up

1216
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,060
in range but those things are well built

1217
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,380
low nose noise floor really capable

1218
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,790
you'll see FlightAware sells their own

1219
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,490
device that is specifically targeted to

1220
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,550
ad SB new electric I have one of those

1221
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,430
right here great device but also has

1222
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,900
different drivers so your your

1223
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,820
compatibility so there's a lot of

1224
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,500
options out there just be mindful that

1225
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,610
they all have their caveats um let's

1226
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,530
talk a little bit about software how am

1227
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,420
I going on time oh my speed it up a

1228
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,380
little bit um software so there's a lot

1229
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,360
of options um one of the basic ones is

1230
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,540
good in radio this is really kind of low

1231
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,010
level you're you're talking about

1232
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,600
implementing your own components in

1233
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,990
software but if you want to learn radio

1234
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,060
concepts this is a really great place to

1235
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,030
start and you can do basically anything

1236
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,460
you want to in radio so the screenshot

1237
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,080
here is actually one that I built this

1238
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,920
is a an FM receiver um and and is

1239
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,840
showing you can see low-pass filter in

1240
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,740
here you can see you know tuners and and

1241
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,080
and sinks and one of the really great

1242
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,230
parts about this is you can debug while

1243
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,060
you're working so you can see GUI syncs

1244
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,520
and all throughout here this allows me

1245
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,620
to see at each stage of this radio what

1246
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,090
does the waveform look like and it's a

1247
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,440
really good tool for learning about

1248
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,690
radio and a digital signal processing

1249
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,310
but let's say you don't want to get down

1250
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,770
in the weeds um your best bet and

1251
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,510
probably the place to start is with SDR

1252
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,230
sharp or HD SDR these are out-of-the-box

1253
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,790
applications that allow you to

1254
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,350
do most of what you're going to want to

1255
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,710
do FM radio AM radio lower sideband

1256
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,560
upper sideband

1257
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,420
these are your more out-of-the-box tools

1258
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,240
that that will allow you to interface a

1259
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,940
lot easier there's a lot of settings on

1260
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,430
them you have a lot of capabilities but

1261
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,280
you're not literally putting together

1262
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,130
components like you are a new radio and

1263
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,750
then you also have applications are kind

1264
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,730
of just out of the box um you don't

1265
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,800
really have to know much about radio you

1266
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,750
just set them up in their applications

1267
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,120
FlightAware a DSP is a really good

1268
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,590
example they sell packages with a

1269
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:55,740
Raspberry Pi and I are you know a USB

1270
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,320
dongle that you just set up and you

1271
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,840
start feeding them flight tracking data

1272
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,580
and you can monitor them yourselves the

1273
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,730
cool thing too is uh the hack RF one has

1274
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,700
or at least the porta pack has firmware

1275
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,670
to do this out of the box so it's a it's

1276
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,720
a cool thing that you can just get up

1277
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,770
and going without really having much

1278
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,940
knowledge and another cool thing ngse

1279
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,600
decoder so analog video you can decode

1280
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,450
it pretty easily over using a computer

1281
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,830
so this is something fun to play with

1282
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,390
you know I don't know where you're gonna

1283
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,190
find analog TV signals other than hand

1284
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,870
bands anymore I don't think they put out

1285
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,270
analog TV signals anymore but if you

1286
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,790
find them you can decode them and then

1287
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,560
one of the cooler ones is a NOAA weather

1288
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,350
satellite imagery so for example this is

1289
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,670
actually levering leveraging SDR sharp

1290
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,020
but feeding that information into a

1291
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,750
program called WX to image um and as you

1292
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,190
can see they're they're receiving a

1293
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,050
radio signal and decoding into an image

1294
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,810
and there's just a lot of cool stuff

1295
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,040
that you can do out there there's a lot

1296
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,010
of good tutorials and free software too

1297
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,100
to play around with all this stuff and

1298
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,830
then one of the coolest things are

1299
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,870
programs like universal radio hacker and

1300
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,060
spectrum and these are applications that

1301
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,570
can assist you in demodulating signals

1302
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,480
so if you have frequency shift keying or

1303
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,190
on-off keying out in the wild and you

1304
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,840
find those and you you capture those

1305
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,040
signals you can bring them into these

1306
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,710
programs to help you assist figuring now

1307
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,250
okay

1308
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:26,490
what is the modulation scheme here and

1309
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,740
actually extracting the information now

1310
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,730
I've been playing around with this

1311
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,710
recently to decode my garage

1312
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,200
to actually get the bits coming off of

1313
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,160
it from from the wave form that actually

1314
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,359
brings me to the future um in the future

1315
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,640
I why I didn't have time to cover it in

1316
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,530
this talk but I want to dive deeper into

1317
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,630
a lot of the concepts that were brought

1318
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,760
up here digital signal processing

1319
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,800
concepts and radio theory more

1320
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,470
importantly I want to demo canoe radio I

1321
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,690
want to show you how to build an AM

1322
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,540
radio out of components and I want to

1323
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,250
show you how to use programs like

1324
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,800
universal radio hacker and spectrum to

1325
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,510
find find devices out in the wild and

1326
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:11,220
reverse-engineer how they work because

1327
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,930
as you know security research is that's

1328
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:16,319
what we want to do and that's the last

1329
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,809
page just a few additional resources if

1330
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:20,010
you guys want to go off and learn a

1331
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,420
little bit more on your own

1332
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,940
great Scot gadgets the maker of the hack

1333
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,339
RF one has really great resources

1334
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,770
Michael Osmond is amazing has given some

1335
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,260
really good talks at Def Con and other

1336
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,579
cyber security conferences on

1337
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,640
software-defined radio and has a really

1338
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,410
good video series on his website for

1339
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,480
free that will teach you a lot of the

1340
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,859
radio concepts and get you up and going

1341
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,569
with things like a new radio I

1342
00:55:42,569 --> 00:55:44,030
definitely recommend you check them out

1343
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,980
the other one is a three volume series

1344
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,290
called field expedient SDR physical

1345
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,640
books if you like to have physical books

1346
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,960
in your hand it's a really great

1347
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,839
introduction to SDR a lot of radio books

1348
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,700
that are out there are super technical

1349
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,010
in the radio theory and this is a really

1350
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,619
great way of getting your hands dirty it

1351
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:03,119
walks you through how to set up a new

1352
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,040
radio and actually understand all these

1353
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,530
concepts it's what I read in in

1354
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,599
preparation for this talk and then a few

1355
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,630
more rtl-sdr comm has great tutorials on

1356
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,829
basically everything I talked about

1357
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,980
today reddit has an rtl-sdr subreddit

1358
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,270
which also has some really good

1359
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,089
information and just another call you

1360
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,190
know call out to Samy Kamkar he's a

1361
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,170
security researcher but does work with

1362
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,210
software-defined radio check him out

1363
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,619
google him he's got some really good

1364
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,349
talks and what's that that's all I've

1365
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:35,780
got so

1366
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,370
right I'll know if you want to do it now

1367
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,480
but I guess we can open up the the

1368
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,580
question for floors or if you if you

1369
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,410
want to wait until both presentations

1370
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,450
are over to do that well thank you Phil

1371
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,070
I was actually going to ask if anybody

1372
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,260
has any questions they are welcome to

1373
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,620
unmute themselves and ask away that's

1374
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:57,980
all right it was a very thorough

1375
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,340
presentation and I had to be out for a

1376
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,290
little bit of it but I will be listening

1377
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,690
to the res Bella that was excellent and

1378
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,020

who you are the presenter okay make sure

1385
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:38,119
you share what screen you want yep we

1386
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:46,599

thank you very much

1388
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:51,400
laters okay have a great presentation

1389
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,740
okay thank you

1390
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,200
I hope we're all gonna hear me okay my

1391
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,700
name is Michael Brown I think hopefully

1392
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,280
most of guys are we're who I am I'll be

1393
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,680
met at past meetings so the focus of

1394
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,140
this talk is to talk about the new

1395
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,339
privacy framework that has come from

1396
00:58:07,339 --> 00:58:10,160
NIST and you know we're probably talking

1397
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,809
a little bit about privacy and I think

1398
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:13,250
probably should probably preface that

1399
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,319
with you know we're all security

1400
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:16,550
professionals here and some of you

1401
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,770
probably thinking like wow I'm into

1402
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,240
security I don't really care about

1403
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,059
privacy why should I care and so on and

1404
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:25,730
so forth and honestly you know I'm

1405
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,309
almost in the same boat I consider

1406
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:30,020
myself a security professional been

1407
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,630
working in security for quite a while

1408
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,950
but in last few years as a security

1409
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:37,609
consultant I have found myself more and

1410
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:39,920
more pulled over or have to be involved

1411
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,059
in in privacy matters and honestly for

1412
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:46,430
myself I'm getting the point where you

1413
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,319
know I know I need to get more novel

1414
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,089
about privacy

1415
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:52,790
and I think that's that that's something

1416
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,010
that I think other other of us in our

1417
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,559
security community need to do the things

1418
00:58:57,559 --> 00:58:59,869
you need to do the same thing we need to

1419
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,270
be more mindful of you know the related

1420
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,369
field of privacy some of the stuff that

1421
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:05,990
we are doing will probably pull us in to

1422
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:10,280
privacy so better to take advantage of

1423
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,920
it and find out more then beyond the

1424
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,920
back into the curve it's a little

1425
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,240
background on myself for those who

1426
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,700
aren't too familiar with me and my

1427
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,240
experience

1428
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,640
so I found this cute little cartoon I

1429
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,500
have a few others in the presentation

1430
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,130
you know the privacy trainwreck I love

1431
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,300
some of the things they had here I have

1432
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,190
over they have here over the side here

1433
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:37,940
the the privacy officer I warned you all

1434
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,770
that seems to be the the the the bane of

1435
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,540
people you know as privacy officer

1436
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,430
security officer you know trying to try

1437
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,730
to get the company to go on the right

1438
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,100
direction and down to the bottom here we

1439
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,140
got the consultant going oh I'll clean

1440
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,510
up the mess and that's that somehow

1441
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:57,240
that's someone that's me trying to kind

1442
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,130
of help out our clients and help them

1443
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,230
the right way but you know this is the

1444
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,270
thing I also was trying to look for some

1445
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,770
kind of a present take you know kind of

1446
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:08,370
a slide on you know stats for privacy

1447
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,810
breaches and wasn't really able to find

1448
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,240
a really good one but a thing to keep in

1449
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,670
mind is that you know we've had a lot of

1450
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:17,430
these really big data breaches in the

1451
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:20,970
last few years and in many cases a lot

1452
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:24,180
of them are breaches of privacy its

1453
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,480
breach of privacy data and that's the

1454
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,840
minute we medium you mindful of so we're

1455
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,770
going to do is I said we're going to do

1456
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,030
some you know look into some of the

1457
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,190
definitions talking but there's a little

1458
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:37,200
bit privacy regulations you can spend

1459
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,470
whole hours talking about them touch on

1460
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,510
on this I think I should talk a little

1461
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,890
bit about what the the sub history

1462
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,990
framework is and then go into the

1463
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,030
privacy framework itself and then I

1464
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,070
always like to wrap things up you know

1465
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,410
again similar was Phillips presentation

1466
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,360
of resources that you know give you some

1467
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,160
pointers and work you know directions

1468
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,440
for where you want to go next in

1469
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,370
learning more about this subject so I

1470
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:03,780
think first off you know again it's been

1471
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,250
funny the helping I understand is like

1472
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,210
you know what we talk about we talk

1473
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,610
about personal data information so some

1474
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:09,990
terms you might hear you might hear the

1475
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,800
term pH I which stands for protected

1476
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,940
health information not not personal

1477
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,200
health information that's basically

1478
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,230
that's the term for basically medical

1479
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,210
records you know you go to your doctor

1480
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,010
or you go to a hospital and all that

1481
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,480
medical information they crate for you

1482
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,330
is called pH I all has to be protected

1483
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,010
you know if you get into the legalese

1484
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:35,010
you know there's like 18 identified

1485
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:38,700
is that some combination constitutes pH

1486
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,270
AI and basically it's anything that can

1487
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:46,320
identify a person and a medical

1488
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,950
condition that's pH AI and it could be

1489
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,170
like just two or three of those 18 it

1490
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,370
doesn't have to be all of them but it

1491
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,560
could be things like oh hey here's a lab

1492
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,410
result on someone oh and we know who

1493
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,060
that person is we know the lab results

1494
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,160
and that gives us information or oh I

1495
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,650
got the slide of an x-ray and oh it's

1496
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,680
got the person's name on it and

1497
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,000
identifiers and so on and so forth

1498
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,400
PII is more broadly as personally

1499
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,110
notifiable information that basically

1500
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:15,030
again the same thing information that

1501
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:17,340
can identify an individual you know some

1502
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,410
combination is so security number phone

1503
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,140
number address you know and so forth and

1504
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,970
then there's an even broader thing about

1505
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:26,880
personal data what I mean by personal

1506
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,670
data it's all kind of data about you

1507
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,460
that you may or may not want people to

1508
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,490
know but you know it's oftentimes being

1509
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:38,240
being gathered this is anything from

1510
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,980
what do you like to buy you know what do

1511
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,750
you like to listen to watch your

1512
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:46,260
favorite movies and TV shows where do

1513
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,810
you go on vacation and some feeler like

1514
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,710
that's that's no big deal except that

1515
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,240
this all information about you and

1516
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,580
that's information that other people can

1517
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:00,180
make use of for good or bad yeah and

1518
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,680
maybe something I've experienced this

1519
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,390
but I've seen this in fact I had this

1520
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,550
yes I mean you know good at illustration

1521
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,670
this recently where to help out one of

1522
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,290
my clients I went over I was doing some

1523
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,450
research online you know doing a Google

1524
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,300
search looking up things about you know

1525
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,850
website accessibility which is basically

1526
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,740
making sure websites are accessible

1527
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:23,330
people with various physical handicaps

1528
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:28,170
after doing that I went over to YouTube

1529
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,050
to watch it you know a video and guess

1530
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:35,090
what happened to me I had an ad pop up

1531
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,640
for a law firm you know for like oh how

1532
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,190
you can protect yourself for lawsuits if

1533
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:44,610
your website isn't accessible for people

1534
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,590
with handicap it's like what the heck

1535
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,810
well we're here on Google do a search

1536
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,050
go over to Yahoo and somehow Yahoo knows

1537
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,280
that I was searching that any was giving

1538
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,500
me in ads and I'm sure some ones I've

1539
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,970
seen this where we know you do a search

1540
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,250
on some iron or what have you and then

1541
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,220
we go over to your email client or a

1542
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,500
Facebook or whatever and we get popup

1543
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,440
ads really do the same thing you know so

1544
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,130
that's that's the use of personal data

1545
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:14,000
sadly had we live in a generation that

1546
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,490
overly shares stuff you know you get

1547
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:20,310
people to go to a restaurant they feel

1548
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,660
they gotta take pictures of their other

1549
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,480
meal and post it you know and stuff like

1550
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,120
that they've got overly share on you

1551
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,490
know how they're doing how the feeling

1552
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,140
where they go and what they watch what

1553
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,000
they read in yadda yadda yadda and some

1554
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,290
of us ups ok but sometimes gets

1555
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,360
overboard you know and it can be

1556
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,430
dangerous you know if you're on a

1557
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,350
vacation and you're telling everyone on

1558
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,550
fit on social media that you're on

1559
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:44,040
vacation that just opens you up for oh

1560
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,990
hey this person isn't home we can go and

1561
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:51,780
steal some from his house but that's the

1562
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:56,280
thing we're dealing with so you know and

1563
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,080
it makes this a little bit more fun so I

1564
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,760
already had a few view cartoons and

1565
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,760
little whatnot whatnot so I leader some

1566
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,260
definitions this is comes from a website

1567
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,350
basically a blog by name of fraud on

1568
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:09,330
fraud and it's from a guy named David

1569
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,880
Froude he's a security consultant out of

1570
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,910
the UK I believe I really liked is web

1571
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:18,570
we're like his blog so so these are some

1572
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,310
definitions and I think they're useful

1573
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,780
so security and this is where we're

1574
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:25,080
where we are from so obviously that you

1575
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,270
know this is kind of like getting from

1576
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:29,580
very broad to getting more specific so

1577
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,440
security at all aspects of security from

1578
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,380
physical to logical so physical is you

1579
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,090
know hey you know physicals go to the

1580
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,640
building you got cameras you got guards

1581
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,100
you know fences and wanna logical that's

1582
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,830
all the computer stuff we do more deep

1583
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,720
you know more specific we have data

1584
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,390
security or information security we're

1585
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:51,120
we're protecting data or information and

1586
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,740
whatever form it's in whether it's in

1587
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,410
paper like you go to a you know to a

1588
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,930
company and they've got masses of paper

1589
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,680
records hopefully in a secure room

1590
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,890
[Music]

1591
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,710
to an electronic form ie on people's

1592
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,779
laptops and a server room hopefully in

1593
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:09,019
the cloud and so forth and then of

1594
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:10,279
course cybersecurity which is more most

1595
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:12,319
of us are focused on which is more

1596
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,900
protecting that electronic data whether

1597
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:19,279
it's on tapes whether it's on a floppy

1598
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:24,140
drive or USB or in the cloud or

1599
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:28,150
what-have-you so that's all important

1600
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:31,400
privacy I think for some of us we don't

1601
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,170
quite you know maybe not like understand

1602
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,880
it but here probably is more of a state

1603
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,160
of you're not being observed or

1604
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,680
disturbed by other people so it's kind

1605
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,210
of more of a state of mind but then data

1606
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,239
privacy or information privacy deals

1607
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:48,799
with the proper handling of data so

1608
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,359
things like collection and so much we

1609
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:52,279
don't even think about this is that you

1610
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:55,489
know the collection of data on us is how

1611
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:57,769
is that being done are they asking us

1612
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:00,289
questions or giving us a survey or are

1613
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:02,720
they watching what we're buying or

1614
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,539
they're noting that hey this person has

1615
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:07,219
bought these things you know I see the

1616
01:07:07,219 --> 01:07:08,569
again I see this on Amazon you know

1617
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:11,029
search for certain things or buy certain

1618
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:13,900
things and those like based upon your

1619
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,359
prior purchases we recommend these to

1620
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,019
you is that if consent you know did they

1621
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:24,200
do they ask us if they can collect and

1622
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,400
our information you know sometimes there

1623
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,279
is an explicit you know ask for consent

1624
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:33,140
sometime there's almost an implied idea

1625
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,450
and then of course that use of that data

1626
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,979
how are they using that data are they

1627
01:07:36,979 --> 01:07:38,359
using it so they can sell us something

1628
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:42,229
or they are they using it to sell that

1629
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:43,549
data to someone else which is the

1630
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:46,009
transfer to the third parties and so

1631
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:47,900
forth and we're seeing more and more

1632
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,930
regulations now that are looking at the

1633
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:51,950
sort of thing like you know how are you

1634
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,749
collecting this data how are you using

1635
01:07:53,749 --> 01:07:56,539
that data and are you selling that to

1636
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,430
someone else and are you are these

1637
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:00,650
people aware of this and then we get

1638
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,569
into data data protection which is horse

1639
01:08:02,569 --> 01:08:05,029
is dealing with you know the

1640
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:07,609
unauthorized use ie using that data

1641
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:10,489
about me with my authorization have you

1642
01:08:10,489 --> 01:08:12,829
done that you know the corruption that

1643
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,150
data

1644
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:17,000
it's loss you know someone has stolen it

1645
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,589
or what have you and that availability

1646
01:08:18,589 --> 01:08:21,738
can I you're collecting data on me can I

1647
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:22,729
see that data

1648
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:24,948
maybe that data is incorrect maybe have

1649
01:08:24,948 --> 01:08:27,319
you know maybe I was doing a search but

1650
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:29,899
I don't really interesting that I was

1651
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:32,270
just doing it for something else so

1652
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,469
these are all and all important things

1653
01:08:33,469 --> 01:08:35,750
to consider and then you did this nice

1654
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,929
little Venn diagram you know which shows

1655
01:08:38,929 --> 01:08:40,670
that hey security press there is an

1656
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,219
overlap and I'm seeing a more and more

1657
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,640
of an overlap there so where I'm more in

1658
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,408
the security side I'm being poke me as I

1659
01:08:48,408 --> 01:08:50,600
said of being dealing with more of that

1660
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,460
privacy side they kind of over last

1661
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,189
would security and then because he was

1662
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:57,439
more talking about GDP are you know he

1663
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,420
has this a little area where like GDP

1664
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:04,189
are Falls in and then I found this other

1665
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:05,658
diagram which I thought wasn't saying to

1666
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:08,089
which is again shows the you know the

1667
01:09:08,089 --> 01:09:11,089
overlap of privacy and security security

1668
01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:12,560
here they're using the CIA triad

1669
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,649
confidentially integrity availability

1670
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:16,370
hopefully everyone's familiar with that

1671
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,080
then over in privacy again something I

1672
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,429
talked about the collection of that

1673
01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:21,560
personal information using and

1674
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,479
disclosing it the quality of that data

1675
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:25,759
and then of course they access and of

1676
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,198
course there is that that overlap the

1677
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,020
protection of that information that

1678
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,770
needs to be done as I said you know

1679
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,630
we're seeing now more and more privacy

1680
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,600
regulations now there are several I

1681
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,130
think most states have some kind of a

1682
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,549
state regulation regarding it and we

1683
01:09:43,549 --> 01:09:45,529
have that in Florida fit but as is the

1684
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:48,380
Florida information Privacy Act but most

1685
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,679
these regulations were more around data

1686
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,960
breach reporting you know the you know

1687
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,659
the company had a breach of data what

1688
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,640
who they need to need to report to how

1689
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,610
quickly and so forth but not much more

1690
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:02,500
than that

1691
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,330
gdpr which is the general data

1692
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:10,310
protection regulation as a as a EU

1693
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:14,150
European Union regulation and it and in

1694
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:16,370
my opinion can I really raise the bar in

1695
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:19,880
terms of these privacy regulations it's

1696
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,460
all about giving people more control

1697
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,440
over their data there's some other

1698
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,699
instinct on others this is the concept

1699
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:26,570
of the right to

1700
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:30,560
be forgotten this is more about hey you

1701
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,739
got wrong information about me you need

1702
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:34,940
to what you know you need to get rid of

1703
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,150
that even versus like oh you you have

1704
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,400
you need to wipe out all my data there's

1705
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,110
also the concept I'm hearing out more

1706
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,530
more in society of privacy by design

1707
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,880
which is kind of interesting because we

1708
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,290
kind of had the same idea in security

1709
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,420
this idea of security by design you know

1710
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,699
don't just you build the system and then

1711
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:56,329
at the end you go oh yeah let's add

1712
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,250
security you know it's like no no no

1713
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,540
when you're building your system let's

1714
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,550
let's have security from the get-go all

1715
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,199
the way through and the same thing you

1716
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,880
know building security all the way

1717
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,550
through there's also the expectation of

1718
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,980
conducting what's called a dpi a that's

1719
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,040
a data privacy impact analysis or

1720
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,869
assessment which is anything because we

1721
01:11:14,869 --> 01:11:16,460
have this idea of a business impact

1722
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,329
assessment in you know in or a security

1723
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:21,920
risk assessment which is what we've had

1724
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,090
for a long time and now we talk about

1725
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:25,540
okay we needed you need to conduct a

1726
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,000
privacy impact assessment to understand

1727
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,790
hey if there was a privacy breach of

1728
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:34,190
privacy impact what's that gonna affect

1729
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,139
your business and also having what's

1730
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:38,449
called a DPO which is a data privacy

1731
01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:40,400
officer just like we have a security

1732
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,659
officer course were you know I see so

1733
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:46,550
there's the content of having a similar

1734
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:50,449
thing over on the privacy side then we

1735
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:52,070
have CCPA which is the California

1736
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,310
Consumer Privacy Act which as some

1737
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,139
people have referred to as being kind of

1738
01:11:57,139 --> 01:11:59,710
kind of the first step of a state level

1739
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,389
you know GDP are kind of equivalent

1740
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:04,329
there's simulators there's differences

1741
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:07,280
again it gives data rights to the

1742
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,300
consumer

1743
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,760
it gives them my sentence you can say no

1744
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,010
to the selling of your data you can

1745
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,750
force the deletion of your data and so

1746
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,780
forth I think a lot of people kind of

1747
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,909
feeling that well with these regulations

1748
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:21,829
that we're gonna see probably more and

1749
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:24,770
more the states doing this and I'm

1750
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:26,570
saying more and more some companies are

1751
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:29,210
worried about this gdpr is well it's a

1752
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,030
European regulation it's there to

1753
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:36,110
protect people of the EU so even though

1754
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,550
here we are in the u.s. you know we

1755
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:38,719
can't say like oh we don't care about

1756
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,460
that the thing is is yet

1757
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,480
companies organizations that have data

1758
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,460
from EU citizens they got to worry about

1759
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:46,850
that

1760
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,440
same thing with CCPA it's about

1761
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,910
protecting people from California so we

1762
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,080
may be here in forward he might say oh I

1763
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,520
don't care we're not you know California

1764
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,890
isn't here yet yeah but if you got data

1765
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,660
from people from California and data

1766
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,400
from people from Europe you got to worry

1767
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,920
about this sort of stuff and I think as

1768
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,900
more and more states do this I think

1769
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,070
more and more we're gonna have to kind

1770
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:12,550
of worry about these things yeah another

1771
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:18,380
little cartoon I threw in here I don't

1772
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,660
rely on consent to process personal data

1773
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,400
but when I do it's only because I don't

1774
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,630
meet any other lawful conditions okay

1775
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,430
another thing I want to throw is HIPPA

1776
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:29,960
cuz I do a lot of stuff with HIPAA and

1777
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,250
it's gonna have some mincing aspects

1778
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,260
when it comes to security privacy I kind

1779
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,570
of want to throw out which i think is

1780
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:38,120
interesting you know hip again and for

1781
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,920
those who may not be aware is that it's

1782
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,160
the federal regulation dealing with with

1783
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,030
how to protect that medical records in

1784
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,290
clicking about hospitals and doctors as

1785
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,140
well as well as anything that anyone

1786
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,940
that does work for them that uses that

1787
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,800
so it's anything they have both a

1788
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,110
security rule and a Privacy Rule aspect

1789
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:59,030
with with the regulation the security

1790
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,380
rule is dealing with stuff more that

1791
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,719
we're worried about ie IT security and

1792
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,400
so forth and but the Privacy Rule is

1793
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,080
there and it's also about those are a

1794
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,030
privacy right you know concepts of

1795
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:10,040
protecting you know the use of that

1796
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,960
medical information and other aspects

1797
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,920
one thing we see a lot with with

1798
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,180
healthcare organizations they'll have a

1799
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,830
set of security policies which are

1800
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,380
policies that we as security private

1801
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:22,610
probably who probably would be familiar

1802
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:24,980
with you know you got a you know policy

1803
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:27,710
about you know backups and you know

1804
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,780
setting up a user accounts and network

1805
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,330
security and yadda yadda yadda but they

1806
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:34,910
also have a set of privacy policies you

1807
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,260
know they set down hat you know begin

1808
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:40,070
you know getting consent to use that

1809
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,380
data and giving access to it one thing

1810
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:45,050
with with healthcare and whatnot is you

1811
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,030
know there is control of you know data

1812
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:50,360
like okay if you're sick you know you

1813
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,360
the doctor can't tell your family

1814
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,290
members about you can

1815
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,660
unless there has been permission in

1816
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,110
place about it and then yeah so what we

1817
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:01,490
see and many you know health care

1818
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,720
organizations usually the bigger ones

1819
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,910
will see both a security officer which

1820
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:07,670
is be basically a seaso and a privacy

1821
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,440
officer you know they call it a chief

1822
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,830
privacy officer and you know whereas the

1823
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:15,020
seaso will often be more in the would be

1824
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,480
part of the IT organization the privacy

1825
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,300
officer is usually part of a compliance

1826
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,970
organization or compliance aspect and in

1827
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:26,300
some cases it might be a lawyer or legal

1828
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,780
counsel for the organization and before

1829
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,460
I move on one thing I remembered you

1830
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,110
know I wanted to bring this up was I

1831
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:39,440
actually okay yeah it had a interesting

1832
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,250
aspect with gdpr that I learned recently

1833
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:49,000
which is a grandmother was sued under

1834
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,180
gdpr

1835
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:55,010
and was forced unless you paid penalties

1836
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:58,930
to take town pictures of her grandkids

1837
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:03,500
from Facebook and when I saw that I what

1838
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,960
the heck and then it took a look at it

1839
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,050
and you know the more tootin there was

1840
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,460
actually more - but again I was like

1841
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,690
this is kind of ridiculous

1842
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,750
is it goes - back to that thing of

1843
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,420
consent apparently there's been I guess

1844
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:20,350
in this family has been a little

1845
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,310
breakdown of the family or what-have-you

1846
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,890
where apparently you know the parents

1847
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:25,790
aren't too happy with the grandmother

1848
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,570
what-have-you

1849
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:28,550
so because the parents have not

1850
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:32,530
apparently given the grandmother consent

1851
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,700
she's not she doesn't have their

1852
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,650
permission to post the pictures of her

1853
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:41,120
grandkids on social media so they sued

1854
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,260
her against you gdpr

1855
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,540
I mean I was kind of bit ridiculous I'm

1856
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,760
sorry but I guess that's why I'm out a

1857
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,040
lawyer because I mean I'm sorry if I was

1858
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,330
that judge would say yes okay yeah this

1859
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,370
meets the spirit of law but look at it

1860
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:55,070
all but not the spirit but I just really

1861
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:58,400
Gillis okay so nest this for those who

1862
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,840
may not be familiar is the National

1863
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,940
Institute of Standards and Technology it

1864
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,310
is a part of the US Department of

1865
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,660
Commerce they like to say that they are

1866
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,760
a non array

1867
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,650
taury group that you basically do like

1868
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,820
standards and measurements on a

1869
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,010
scientific research centers and

1870
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,200
technology mainly for the use of the

1871
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,900
government but because we're paying for

1872
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,150
it as taxpayers we have full access to

1873
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,740
all the stuff they do which is really

1874
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,600
great I think most of us familiar with

1875
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,920
their there they're great they're a

1876
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:30,890
special publication 811 tended for FISMA

1877
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,380
but are still very very useful for those

1878
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,960
of us in the InfoSec industry to make

1879
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:40,690
use of likes 853 which is you know their

1880
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,640
security and privacy control set and I

1881
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,230
think it's 39 which is the risk

1882
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,640
management framework and things like

1883
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,640
that as well as developing the NIST CSF

1884
01:17:51,640 --> 01:18:00,620
so briefly on the NIST CSF works order

1885
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,330
this one back to you in 2013 due to a

1886
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:06,530
executive order they then spent most of

1887
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,200
2013 holding a series of five workshops

1888
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,210
and these were workshops basically

1889
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,670
anyone could come in and attend they're

1890
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,170
very it's one thing I like about this is

1891
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,270
that what they do is very open that

1892
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:20,210
anyone can be involved you know or help

1893
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,310
contribute the things that they're

1894
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,710
working on

1895
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,450
they then of course released the first

1896
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:29,660
version back in February 2014 which is

1897
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:35,450
now six years later and then in the

1898
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:36,710
following years I held some more

1899
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,210
workshops I actually was able to take

1900
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:42,020
ten the second of these three where we

1901
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,150
spent a lot of time looking at what the

1902
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:47,300
next version of the CSF would be whether

1903
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,560
it would be a version one point

1904
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,420
something or a - oh and what will be

1905
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:53,090
involved in variants thing it was

1906
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:55,310
anything to attend be able talk to some

1907
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:58,220
you know it's kind of an you must have

1908
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,290
an average person you know be able to go

1909
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,240
to these events and talking to kind of

1910
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,600
high-level people is pretty interesting

1911
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:11,700
then of course in April

1912
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:14,840
when they released the version 1 1 and

1913
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,120
you know we've been going we're growing

1914
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,280
from that so the framework has three

1915
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,920
parts the core the tiers the profile

1916
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,080
core I think what most people focus on

1917
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,420
that's kind of the controls you know

1918
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,040
what you have to have put in place for

1919
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,620
cybersecurity the profile is a very

1920
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,740
insane way of you know aligning

1921
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,550
standards in term like you know okay

1922
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,040
where do you currently stand where do

1923
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,410
you want to go to kind of give you a

1924
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,120
kind of robot but where to build toward

1925
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,120
and using some industrial standards in

1926
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,940
terms of you know building what you make

1927
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,280
use of the implementation tiers I have

1928
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,930
to be honest that's one aspect of the

1929
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:53,520
framework that a lot of people just

1930
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,290
don't like it's a kind of a what we call

1931
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:59,340
a maturity model that kind of looks at

1932
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,870
when you know how an organization looks

1933
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:02,490
at their risks and how they kind of

1934
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:05,610
implement it and improve things but I

1935
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:07,470
think that a lot of you really like it I

1936
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:12,030
know I I don't so here are some things

1937
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:15,330
in it I love this circle logo they they

1938
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:17,580
developed which has the five cores and

1939
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,380
they do the color coding which I like so

1940
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,860
you have identify protect detect respond

1941
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,800
recover identify is basically

1942
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,120
understanding what is in your

1943
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,920
environment in terms of hardware

1944
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,360
software assets what kind of

1945
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,040
organization you are and then so forth

1946
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,710
protect is to put the measurements in

1947
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:37,290
place to protect what you have detect is

1948
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,880
you have something in place that will

1949
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,390
note and detect you know what what's

1950
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,040
going on then if something does happen

1951
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,650
you respond to it so I'd be like your

1952
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,210
instant response program and so forth

1953
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,860
and then recover that would be okay

1954
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,290
you've had this impact let's get back up

1955
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,930
and running

1956
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,400
so there's five functions it's fully

1957
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,380
divided into 23 categories and then

1958
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,600
there's further 106 subcategory those

1959
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,430
are the actual controls and then what

1960
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:03,630
they've done is they've had what they

1961
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,250
call informative references which they

1962
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,740
cross map the subcategories to different

1963
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,040
things such as ISO 27001 which is this

1964
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,880
which is a cybersecurity framework from

1965
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,160
international body this 853 which is the

1966
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,040
security and privacy controls from FISMA

1967
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,010
COBIT 5 which is another

1968
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:28,190
governance framework from aisaka the

1969
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,690
critical security controls may be worth

1970
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:31,340
they used version 5 when they wrote this

1971
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,950
and so forth they've taken this further

1972
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:37,310
to create a whole online catalogue of

1973
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:40,160
these you know crosswalks and mappings

1974
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,550
now so they have actually now have an

1975
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:46,370
updated for copa 2019 updated for it you

1976
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,710
know they have its the critical nero are

1977
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:51,080
7-1 cross mapping and all these others

1978
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,239
as well so that makes it really really

1979
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:55,100
good that occurs of course there's the

1980
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,050
profiles and then the tiers which has

1981
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:59,150
four tiers with four elements i'm not

1982
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,920
going to get too much into it at this

1983
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,540
point so this comprises B so I'm here to

1984
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,400
framework and this is important because

1985
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,310
when they create the privacy framework

1986
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:13,630
they kind of use this as kind of a basic

1987
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:16,400
structure for what they did for the

1988
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,390
privacy framework so privacy framework

1989
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:22,010
is actually it's been they actually went

1990
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,150
through this pretty quickly I was kind

1991
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,950
of surprised they started that they

1992
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:26,600
announced tit two years ago and

1993
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,410
September 2018 they had a workshop and

1994
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,790
then another request for information

1995
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:35,180
shortly thereafter they then had a

1996
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,790
discussion draft and then led to another

1997
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:41,480
workshop then they did addition so that

1998
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:46,400
draft had a third workshop and then a

1999
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,370
brilliant arise and then they released

2000
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:52,780
version 100 in January of this year

2001
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:57,530
so basically little over a year they

2002
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:59,540
created the first version the privacy

2003
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,090
framework I think that it's much quicker

2004
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:03,710
because again they aim to use kind of

2005
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:07,100
the structure as you'll see of the NIST

2006
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:11,090
CSF so if you want to see the privacy

2007
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,260
framework you can go to this website

2008
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,489
they have a whole section for it

2009
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,530
download it and take a look at it again

2010
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:20,330
just like the CSF they have a core if

2011
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,650
profiles and they have inflammation

2012
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:24,080
tiers it's kind of the same way this is

2013
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,670
actually a graphic from their present

2014
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:30,980
you know from the book and again the

2015
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,200
version is one oh this is the full term

2016
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,390
which is a convincing term a tool for

2017
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,580
improving privacy through enterprise

2018
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,659
risk management to

2019
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:40,010
thing they talk about is a lot of is a

2020
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,349
lot about you know addressing privacy

2021
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:44,059
you know and looking at the risks of

2022
01:23:44,059 --> 01:23:47,840
privacy so similar the CSF you there's

2023
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,010
five functions it has 18 categories 100

2024
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:53,959
subcategories now one thing that was

2025
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:56,840
different is they did not include any

2026
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,550
informative reference in the framework

2027
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:00,679
itself they're actually going to keep

2028
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:03,289
that on on the online site with the

2029
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:06,590
expectation that other groups will then

2030
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:08,929
submit those informative references and

2031
01:24:08,929 --> 01:24:12,829
I hope they will then the profiles is

2032
01:24:12,829 --> 01:24:14,209
part of it you know current and function

2033
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:15,320
future I'll talk a little bit more about

2034
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,929
that and again for for implementation

2035
01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:20,659
tiers built on for four elements but

2036
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:21,800
these are different elements these are

2037
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,989
more about privacy so this is the core

2038
01:24:25,989 --> 01:24:28,159
functions the categories new kind of NS

2039
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,219
you paid attention you will see that

2040
01:24:31,219 --> 01:24:33,679
they use different colors but that was

2041
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,559
great as well as the appended each of

2042
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:38,479
these function names with a P for

2043
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:41,590
privacy so you have identify govern

2044
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:47,599
control communicate and protect and I

2045
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,010
thought it wasn't really did you know of

2046
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,030
course I don't my sure helped me

2047
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:51,590
everything is clear so it's like it's

2048
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:54,579
gonna have a red color a yellow purple

2049
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:59,510
green and a blue and what do we what do

2050
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:02,209
they mean by these things so and I these

2051
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:03,499
are actually determine these they

2052
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:05,209
actually take I took this directly from

2053
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:08,929
their phrasing which is a little clunky

2054
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:11,209
okay but identifies kind of what you

2055
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:12,800
would think you know you understand what

2056
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,070
you have in terms of you know your risk

2057
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,260
for privacy so it's like okay what what

2058
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,820
kind of data are you collecting do you

2059
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,709
understand the risks for it you know

2060
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:22,849
Harry I didn't you know how are you

2061
01:25:22,849 --> 01:25:26,510
handling it govern so governances might

2062
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,249
might be a term that some of us maybe

2063
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:31,280
not be too clear on this is something

2064
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,050
more in an organization's it's more your

2065
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,559
management level and term like how they

2066
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:38,719
run the company so here it's about okay

2067
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,130
let's make sure that upper management

2068
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,449
understands what they need to worry

2069
01:25:44,449 --> 01:25:46,939
about you know and in terms of managing

2070
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:50,719
the risk of privacy control this means

2071
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:51,320
okay that you

2072
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,720
the appropriate activities to control

2073
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,950
and manage that data that you have

2074
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:59,530
communicate as are you communicating

2075
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:02,560
both within the organization and outside

2076
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,180
you know that you understand the risks

2077
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,850
of day of data and your head you're

2078
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:09,860
handling privacy and then protective

2079
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,820
means you're putting and putting in

2080
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:13,610
implementations to protect that data

2081
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:19,160
that's the safeguards going a little bit

2082
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,780
further these are the sub categories the

2083
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,030
categories so identify it's kind of

2084
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:24,260
clear what you're talking about here to

2085
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,720
inventory okay what's what's the day

2086
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,340
that you're collecting what's your

2087
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,180
what's that what's the business

2088
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,830
environment you know doing a risk

2089
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,140
assessment and then the would they call

2090
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,030
it we call it data processing ecosystem

2091
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,100
that's basically this whole environment

2092
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:40,490
that is processing data and then

2093
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:42,020
governance you know you have governance

2094
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,060
policies you know what's your strategy

2095
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,010
for it's management awareness and

2096
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:46,820
training which I thought was an

2097
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,500
interesting when I went red went the

2098
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,910
next level from my awareness and

2099
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:51,560
training so Moses probably thing like oh

2100
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,060
yeah yeah security awareness you know

2101
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,070
boom done that's a little bit more than

2102
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,440
that and then are you monitoring what's

2103
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,980
going on we're in reviewing it and then

2104
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,480
the next three control enough I was in

2105
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,420
saying that you have data processing

2106
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,500
policy well you know and then you have

2107
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,090
communications policies and you have

2108
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,460
data protection policies so a big thing

2109
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,870
on making sure that you have policies

2110
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:16,090
procedures and you know and processes

2111
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:18,530
communication is also again about making

2112
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:20,660
sure you have awareness and protect I

2113
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,920
mean you have thing like data security

2114
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,430
and maintenance and so forth so kind of

2115
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,660
interesting internally what they're

2116
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:31,040
looking at and I noted you know

2117
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,390
informative reference are not in the

2118
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,740
seat and not in the privacy framework

2119
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:36,470
itself so what they're expecting is that

2120
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:39,460
different groups will then supply that

2121
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,510
so this thing's like okay I'd like to

2122
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:44,330
see a cross map of GDP are to the

2123
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:47,110
privacy framework or maybe CCPA

2124
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:49,520
unfortunately the way that the rules are

2125
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,160
of how they set things up is NIST is I

2126
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,560
we're not going to do that we need these

2127
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,740
to come from the organization that

2128
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:59,840
crates it and manage it and so forth so

2129
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,660
hopefully we'll see coming from

2130
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,469
California they

2131
01:28:04,469 --> 01:28:06,479
we'll have to then create that cross map

2132
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,260
of CCPA to the privacy framework Health

2133
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:11,670
and Human Service we had to do the same

2134
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:13,860
thing for the HIPAA regulations to the

2135
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,710
privacy framework and so forth other

2136
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,719
other standards other regulations that

2137
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,070
would all had to be developed and then

2138
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,360
they'd all be placed and available

2139
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:25,440
bailable at the NIST website so there's

2140
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,729
been a there's been a couple of these

2141
01:28:26,729 --> 01:28:28,320
things put up but not a whole lot and I

2142
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,449
think honestly I think with the Cobo

2143
01:28:30,449 --> 01:28:33,570
virus and so forth that you know there's

2144
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:35,969
not as much being done as I would like

2145
01:28:35,969 --> 01:28:38,269
to see with the privacy framework

2146
01:28:38,269 --> 01:28:39,929
because people can be kind of like

2147
01:28:39,929 --> 01:28:43,229
distracted on things profiles profiles

2148
01:28:43,229 --> 01:28:44,760
again is really kind of an I think an

2149
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,280
important aspect is you know when people

2150
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,900
look at anything sort of framework they

2151
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,030
see all of these controls you know

2152
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:52,559
there's a hundred or there's two hundred

2153
01:28:52,559 --> 01:28:56,099
if anyone is like oh I had to implement

2154
01:28:56,099 --> 01:28:57,719
all this in my company and so on and so

2155
01:28:57,719 --> 01:28:59,670
forth and that's not that's really not

2156
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:01,469
what you're supposed to be doing you

2157
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:03,630
need to be taking a look at these

2158
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,519
controls and looking at your company and

2159
01:29:05,519 --> 01:29:08,519
decided what which ones makes sense for

2160
01:29:08,519 --> 01:29:11,190
us so the idea here with this is you

2161
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:13,229
have a current profile at a target

2162
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:15,510
profile current is basically what you're

2163
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:18,420
doing now target profile is where you

2164
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,429
need to go to and some of this because

2165
01:29:20,429 --> 01:29:22,800
we developed by you know you looking at

2166
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,749
the risks and so forth another aspect

2167
01:29:24,749 --> 01:29:26,219
which again I think is really important

2168
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:28,530
I saw us with the CSF is that you had

2169
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,320
different groups that created profiles

2170
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:35,699
for different industries so if you were

2171
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:39,199
in manufacturing they would create a

2172
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,449
subsidy framework manufacturing profile

2173
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:44,369
to say okay you're manufacturing this is

2174
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:46,019
what we recommend you have in place now

2175
01:29:46,019 --> 01:29:47,909
and they would do it for other one so I

2176
01:29:47,909 --> 01:29:50,039
what I'm expecting to see with the

2177
01:29:50,039 --> 01:29:52,800
privacy framework is people coming up

2178
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,219
with target profiles for like healthcare

2179
01:29:56,219 --> 01:29:59,820
so here's the healthcare profile here is

2180
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:02,489
the retail target profile and you know

2181
01:30:02,489 --> 01:30:06,989
here is maybe manufacturing maybe higher

2182
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:10,170
education you know finance and so forth

2183
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:12,300
so they get some guidance for an

2184
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,010
organization and say okay yeah here is

2185
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:17,330
what an industry body has Rukn

2186
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,980
is what we should be doing and

2187
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:23,190
implementing this framework again that I

2188
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,560
haven't seen this to happen yet but I

2189
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:30,150
hope to see that soon implementation

2190
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,490
tears as I said this is a kind of a

2191
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:34,350
maturity model that's not quite a

2192
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:36,410
maturity model it has four levels

2193
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:38,340
partial risk informed work we do

2194
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,710
adaptable and the idea is this is not

2195
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:43,830
that oh I need to get to tier four no

2196
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:46,890
the idea is that you need to go to the

2197
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,680
level that is makes sense for your

2198
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,380
organization because get into higher

2199
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,970
levels has a cost you definitely do not

2200
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:58,650
want to be at tier 1 that means that

2201
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:02,430
you're like not quite doing a good job

2202
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:04,290
you know the idea is that you want to be

2203
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:07,530
at least at tier 2 and if it makes sense

2204
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:11,460
for organization maybe 3 or 4 and it's

2205
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,410
based upon these different four elements

2206
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:15,390
and term like how you doing it's kind of

2207
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:20,550
a little bit you know subjective which

2208
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:23,580
is why I don't really like this that is

2209
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,600
you you know because you kind of have to

2210
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,070
like read what they talk about her like

2211
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:28,500
what's met by privacy risk and

2212
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,960
integrated privacy and so forth and what

2213
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,910
that means for each of these four you

2214
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,620
know inflation tiers and I figure out

2215
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:37,380
okay where do you organization fit and

2216
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,580
then kind of fear how do you how do you

2217
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,740
get there so again that's why I said

2218
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,960
with at least with the CSF a lot of

2219
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,930
people just don't like the English tiers

2220
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:51,510
and don't really use it so and there is

2221
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,830
also you know again a kind of a cross

2222
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:55,440
mapping or cross connection between the

2223
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,360
CSF and the privacy framework and this

2224
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,130
again taken from them so I thought this

2225
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,480
was entering in that shows that okay

2226
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,820
you've got the privacy risk which is for

2227
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:07,290
the five core functions and then over

2228
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,340
here the cybersecurity risk would you

2229
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:12,870
have all the five you know core

2230
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:16,290
functions of the CSF where they meet in

2231
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:19,500
the middle is to protect P from privacy

2232
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,770
but also detect respond recover so what

2233
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,570
they basically have done is that instead

2234
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:28,380
of duplicating these

2235
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:33,790
function idea at that these controls in

2236
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,500
the privacy framers everybody think okay

2237
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,510
know when you're using this you need to

2238
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,040
also be pulling this stuff over from the

2239
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,920
CSF and using as well you know suppose

2240
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,150
when you talk about respond and recover

2241
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:45,010
if you're if you something happens in

2242
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:47,650
terms of a data breach or whatever for

2243
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:50,710
for privacy data you need to be facing

2244
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:54,160
doing what's in the CSF so I think

2245
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,450
that's a pretty important thing then

2246
01:32:58,450 --> 01:32:59,590
they had this kind of idea which I

2247
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:00,430
thought was gonna make kind of more

2248
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,350
simplistic way from how to him in point

2249
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:06,130
they talked about ready set go which is

2250
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:08,050
a bit you know in the CSF is more like a

2251
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:11,440
seven step process so that is ready you

2252
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,570
kind of you're gonna identify you know

2253
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,280
what you have you put your governance in

2254
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,190
place and then set you get you you

2255
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:19,630
figure out what your current profile is

2256
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,280
you figure out where you need to go to

2257
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,550
so you have an action plan and then boom

2258
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:26,130
make that happen make that Pyne happen

2259
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:30,640
that's again bit simplistic they try to

2260
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:36,040
make it make things easier for people as

2261
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,480
I said this is they just released

2262
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:40,270
version one and there's a lot of work so

2263
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:41,590
what they've also done and they did this

2264
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:42,880
with the CSF is they have a roadmap

2265
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,360
document which has set out these eight

2266
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,980
items of where they want to go next

2267
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:52,300
so they're already kind of thinking

2268
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,310
forward and turn like okay you know

2269
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:55,660
we've done a lot of work we got version

2270
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,370
one there's still a lot of work to be

2271
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:58,540
done

2272
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:00,000
you know things such as you know

2273
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,469
inventory and mapping ie those cross

2274
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:03,460
maps that I talked about

2275
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:05,290
there's worried about emerging

2276
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:06,670
technologies

2277
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:09,400
you know IOT and all in BOTS and all

2278
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,650
this sort of stuff you know working in

2279
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:14,110
technical standards international and

2280
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:15,700
regulatory aspects I think that's a big

2281
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,530
thing I thought I thought it was very

2282
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:19,060
interesting that even when there's NIST

2283
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,430
CSF came out you know it's like okay

2284
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:25,770
yeah we did the CSF here for the US but

2285
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:29,130
a lot of countries around the world

2286
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:32,500
we're making use of it in some cases

2287
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,719
they just kind of like yeah we can use

2288
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,380
this and just use it as is other company

2289
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:40,300
countries were like okay we can take

2290
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,630
this and we can

2291
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:43,490
some inspiration and how we develop our

2292
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:47,930
own so it's gonna so I kind of expect to

2293
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:49,490
see the same thing and with this privacy

2294
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:52,460
framework that other countries will like

2295
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:55,970
you know take it maybe you know using as

2296
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,470
inspiration for themselves and use it

2297
01:34:57,470 --> 01:35:02,030
for other stuff so so I talk about

2298
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,770
resources and I wanted to kind of give

2299
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,510
things you know to get some ideas for

2300
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:06,920
you guys and again kind of training

2301
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,570
certification organizations and so forth

2302
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:13,070
so some resource again I said you know

2303
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,280
this as it has a whole part of their

2304
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,320
website is focused on the privacy frame

2305
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,550
where it sits that can this is a good

2306
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:22,580
place to go to further for the framework

2307
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,680
a so you can download it down there the

2308
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,950
road map access to all kind of resources

2309
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,970
it's just to just be kind of this is

2310
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,510
just starting so there's not a whole lot

2311
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:33,320
as compared with the cybersecurity

2312
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,390
framework but I think it's going it's

2313
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:36,020
going to get there

2314
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,760
they also have another project they're

2315
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,100
working on once it's this whole privacy

2316
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,870
engineering program I don't know a whole

2317
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,340
lot about it but that's pretty

2318
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,830
interesting that they're doing this then

2319
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:47,830
they have excuse me another set of

2320
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:49,550
documents they have what's called the

2321
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:52,750
NIST IR that's the NIST internal report

2322
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,890
and so they actually carry this

2323
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:56,540
introduction to privacy engineering and

2324
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,780
risk management in federal systems again

2325
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:01,010
this is a lot of stuff me or more to

2326
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:02,960
help the federal set you know government

2327
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,190
and what it does but hey we pay for it

2328
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:10,310
so it's there for us to use as well in

2329
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:11,420
things we do and there are other

2330
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:15,350
resources out there there you see my

2331
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:17,510
screen I actually you see I picked this

2332
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,210
one up which is basically a GD P R for

2333
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:23,210
Dummies book to help me better attend

2334
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,700
gdpr and you know it's pretty friggin

2335
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,770
thick I mean this is uh a foreigner page

2336
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:33,190
so I've read bits and pieces of it I

2337
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:35,390
dread having someone do the same thing

2338
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:40,310
for him for CCPA and so forth if you

2339
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:43,190
want to really get into privacy and I've

2340
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:45,740
been thinking about this I haven't you

2341
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:46,940
know pulled the trigger there is

2342
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,620
actually a whole international

2343
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,750
association for private depression I a

2344
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,350
PP

2345
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,180
they actually do have the Florida

2346
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:57,760
chapter they offer several certification

2347
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,200
they have training resource and so forth

2348
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,210
over here is a picture a book that I got

2349
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:03,520
from them that's really really useful

2350
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,040
it's as you see in the cover privacy law

2351
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,840
fundamentals they do this every two or

2352
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,300
three years so I got that I got some

2353
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,970
other resources from them I've been kind

2354
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,440
of on the fence we're like okay do I

2355
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,120
really want to make me even join this

2356
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,310
group I do I want to think about getting

2357
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,680
their certifications I don't know

2358
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:22,840
my main focus is for my education but

2359
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:26,580
more cloud but privacy has become like

2360
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:31,960
number two after that so I don't know

2361
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,060
they have certifications these are them

2362
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,710
and you can see how complex this is they

2363
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:38,320
have three certifications the privacy

2364
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,520
professional which is cover like the

2365
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,020
person who would be a member of a

2366
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:44,470
compliance organization and because of

2367
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:46,510
the different regulations they actually

2368
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:49,270
had to create four different birds nests

2369
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:50,530
they have a fifth I have music which

2370
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:53,470
they've dropped they have a privacy

2371
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,420
technologist which to me as the person

2372
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:59,740
that would be implementing developing or

2373
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,930
creating the private you know the the

2374
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:03,730
technology aspects of privacy so I would

2375
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:05,560
think you would like to see the seat

2376
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,050
CI PP person would be okay that'd be

2377
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:10,810
like a consultant or maybe a part of a

2378
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:13,210
compliance organization whereas the

2379
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:14,710
technologist I view that aspect like

2380
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,060
this the person is like this like an

2381
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:19,750
engineer type person architect type and

2382
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,550
then they have a manager of privacy

2383
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:25,690
manager certification and again I

2384
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:28,090
mentioned David Froude he mentioned that

2385
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:30,160
of you know he's a security consultant

2386
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,290
and he felt he need to get a privacy so

2387
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:35,380
he says he bit the bullet and one joined

2388
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:38,590
the AFP a a IPP and got all three

2389
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:39,730
certification of course he got the

2390
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:43,500
European one so he's in Europe so and

2391
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:47,560
then aisaka came out with this in the

2392
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:51,370
last couple of months this is suppose we

2393
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:54,340
pronounce SCID it see I'm not making

2394
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:54,820
that up

2395
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,380
certified data privacy solutions

2396
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:58,360
engineer again that's one of the

2397
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,890
technology would be implementing

2398
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:02,290
security currently it's what they call

2399
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:04,930
either and it's an early adoption mode

2400
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:05,440
ie

2401
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,750
if you can prove that

2402
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:10,500
you have done enough within this field

2403
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,820
you can get the certification right now

2404
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:14,530
because unfortunately not doing any

2405
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:16,660
testing or training that won't happen

2406
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:23,050
until early next year I was uh I'll be

2407
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:24,970
honest I'm a nice acha member I wasn't

2408
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:26,620
too keen when I did that did this

2409
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:29,230
certification I'm still not sure how I

2410
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:31,930
feel about it they actually did a survey

2411
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:33,400
of their members and made a big deal

2412
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,470
like oh our members said they wanted

2413
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,880
this ba ba ba ba is like okay really

2414
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,130
because I feel that that serving myself

2415
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:42,150
and I was like why are you doing this

2416
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:44,380
there's a something recalled I a PP

2417
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:46,510
that's doing this stay out of this let

2418
01:39:46,510 --> 01:39:48,370
them do it that's you know this is their

2419
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:51,490
focus why you're you yeah so anyway it

2420
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:54,340
is out there I'm I don't know if I'm

2421
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:56,380
kind of debating should I pursue this or

2422
01:39:56,380 --> 01:40:01,330
not I don't know so with that are there

2423
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:04,990
any questions I want to do this I also

2424
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:07,870
had pulled up this is actually the

2425
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:11,460
framework itself in an Excel spreadsheet

2426
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:14,980
and what's kind of interesting is what

2427
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,090
they've done is they've actually done

2428
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:19,060
some color coding so to speak in the

2429
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,890
actual framework they've done to shading

2430
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,870
they have a dark shading in a kind of a

2431
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:24,970
dark gray light gray so the dark is I

2432
01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:29,050
see a copy from the CSF and the gray is

2433
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,430
kind of like a light gray is kind of

2434
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:33,190
like okay it's a modification but this

2435
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:34,810
goes through and more indefinite or like

2436
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:37,930
what they're talking about in terms of

2437
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:38,920
different things that I said

2438
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:39,940
another thing is kind of in tune when

2439
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:42,340
you read through it how in-depth they

2440
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:43,780
get into out here here's what I talk

2441
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:46,270
about Sri awareness and training you

2442
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,560
know we think about oh yeah yeah it's

2443
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,550
gonna be wearing this okay be ever

2444
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:50,890
talked about okay the workforce is

2445
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:53,380
trained the senior executives are

2446
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,700
trained you know your privacy personnel

2447
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:59,380
you know are trained you and your third

2448
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,340
parties ie

2449
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:03,610
your customers your partners you know

2450
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:05,440
your service providers you know or least

2451
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,430
they understand the roles and

2452
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:09,940
responsibilities so it's a bit more to

2453
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,170
it and then you would think in some

2454
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:13,810
cases and they get pretty granular and

2455
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:15,220
they're like what you need to do as you

2456
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:19,240
can see here you like here in looking at

2457
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,910
the data processing yeah

2458
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:25,940
are they reviewed are they are you

2459
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,680
looking at it for alteration and

2460
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,680
deletion and transmission are they do it

2461
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,710
being destroyed properly and so it gets

2462
01:41:33,710 --> 01:41:35,600
biggest pretty in-depth that they what

2463
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,050
they put through in here so but it is

2464
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:40,610
kind of interesting you know what they

2465
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:46,690
have in the framework so at this point

2466
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:49,100
are there any questions I had this is

2467
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,690
kind of a first one in this presentation

2468
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:52,160
I really love you know feedback

2469
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,530
especially in the early partner like how

2470
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:56,870
I kind of explain as best I can kind of

2471
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:58,250
what privacy is and what it's all about

2472
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:00,380
and I really like to see had it was like

2473
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:01,550
yeah that was really good or like I

2474
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:03,290
don't quite understand this we need to

2475
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:08,060
go back and and rework it Michael this

2476
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:09,980
is Ray uh I just wonder have you seen

2477
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,960
any tools that help with this sort of

2478
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,110
thing when you're doing evaluations or

2479
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:15,740
honestly not that's something that

2480
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:17,510
actually yeah there that this is looking

2481
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:20,210
at is the creation of tools to help out

2482
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:22,880
with this honestly I had to be I be

2483
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,030
honest when I is a the consultant I mean

2484
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:27,760
a lot of my tools are honestly like

2485
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,200
spreadsheets and axing questions and

2486
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,960
getting evidence and so forth so but I

2487
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,460
hope that you know there's there's other

2488
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,470
tool there out there that are more you

2489
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:38,960
know maybe you know likes you know

2490
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,100
there'd be like there's like tool that

2491
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,450
will go out and scan and understand

2492
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:43,700
where the data is especially when you

2493
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,430
get into like DLP data loss prevention

2494
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:48,560
and so forth where it says America thing

2495
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,540
going out there and scanning so where is

2496
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:54,170
data do you have PII or pH I in your

2497
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:55,700
environment and getting a report and so

2498
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:58,460
forth like that but again there's

2499
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:59,840
because it's not a cost and getting

2500
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,270
these sort of tools some groups do it

2501
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:05,180
get them some groups don't so and again

2502
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,710
hopefully is this sort of you know it's

2503
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:09,110
being more mature that will there will

2504
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:10,430
be more these sort of tools out there

2505
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:13,030
what I'm hoping

2506
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:14,950
