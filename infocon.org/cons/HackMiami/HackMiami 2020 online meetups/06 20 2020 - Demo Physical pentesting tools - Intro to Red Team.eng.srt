1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,420
this conference will now be recorded so

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,880
let's go ahead and begin so before we

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,830
begin actually I like to write you guys

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,590
a little bit of a disclaimer due to the

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,450
nature of all the things that will be

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,679
presented today

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,980
so this educational presentation is for

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,630
those who are interested to learn about

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,569
the home security and nutrition testing

10
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,569
and physical penetration testing the

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,300
misuse of the information and/or devices

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,130
in this presentation could result in

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,870
criminal charges for advanced care

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,350
I encourage support or excited any

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,060
illegal activity or hiring without

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,520
written permission in general the author

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
which is me and the medium probably

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,710
disagree will not be held responsible in

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,390
the event any criminal charges brought

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,730
against any individuals misusing their

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,530
formation in this presentation to break

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,990
the law all right so let's let's proceed

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,790
so a little bit of employment solvent

24
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,390
why the person doing this presentation

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,179
so David Mariinsky I'm a hacker

26
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:12,659
penetration tester and a redeemer the

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,999
business of our hackers they just pretty

28
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:17,389
much an office of security company a

29
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:20,520
very very passionate office of security

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,210
that's French

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,799
what did you say indium I love CTS

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,130
Barbeques rosie's if you wanna sets out

33
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,569
I'm a member I'm South Florida I used to

34
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,399
say and also an active member of Hydra

35
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,429
oh they're my teeth in if you want to

36
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:41,219
reach out or also you can show through

37
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,149
Twitter a box this court or army this is

38
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,049
zero Expo

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,060
so um a lot of people ask me why

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,299
physical pentesting um my - why perform

41
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,399
physical fantasy I can categorize it

42
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,860
many things first of all you can

43
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,869
actually be underestimated by companies

44
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,449
for example you have these companies

45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:18,099
that they spend I don't know tons into

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,140
monitoring their network this is fine

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,720
but sometimes they don't think about the

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,380
physical aspect and how we can actually

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:37,930
buy fast or or weak physical security um

50
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,870
it's fun it's definitely fun there's

51
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,860
nothing more a thrill that you get let's

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,590
say at 2:30 in the morning leaving a

53
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,720
sticky note saying that you were there

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,329
on the monitor of the CEO of the company

55
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:58,100
but there's no thrill similar to that it

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,680
also gives the opportunity to to educate

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,220
others on this local security and bring

58
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,319
the physical security awareness like

59
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,299
people think that becomes them as

60
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,450
functions of dollars on to their network

61
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,000
security that we do their security is

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,489
overall well protected well that might

63
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,850
not be the case also keep in mind that

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,769
in any company the weakest link in terms

65
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:31,130
of security is also the opportunity of

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,260
new challenges with a n-gage bank might

67
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,709
want to perform with the following month

68
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,959
my percentage completely different

69
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,940
obstacles and laws me which I have okay

70
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,569
is there anything

71
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,450
I love the Ghibli travel light I think

72
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,239
of anywhere anytime no strings attached

73
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,500
so I just left

74
00:03:54,210 --> 00:05:07,050
so so so regarding online actually you

75
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,970
can actually do a virtual tour of the

76
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,080
inside sense you have the idea to target

77
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,890
you might be able to see there are

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,710
cameras with us or you can have it easy

79
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,390
you have the building second touch turns

80
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,010
accordingly whenever you're doing a

81
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,840
physical benefits a lot of people might

82
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,760
think that these if I thought I may be

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,260
going into the building of two to three

84
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,160
or four TV or some large tactical gear

85
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,980
and all that stuff not really that's not

86
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,980
really the case it's a very social

87
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,650
engineering today that you might be

88
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,560
trying to see whether badges look like

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,950
the bad boys hockey or whatever you

90
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,570
actually want to dress accordingly to

91
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,750
dress in and not to not blend out you

92
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,250
want to go on it like fancy attention to

93
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,430
someone and otherwise that you're not

94
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,840
supposed to be there

95
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
um another thing to keep in mind is when

96
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,889
are you doing social engineering and

97
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,389
then you're interacting with someone

98
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,850
it's always good to have an excuse to

99
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,180
theatre but stop alone if it's an office

100
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,160
that you're trying to get into and I'm

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,900
done let's say they have a building

102
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,340
manager or whatever you could try to do

103
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,250
some research on goes the meetings of

104
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,110
the building and then you pass by the

105
00:06:32,110 --> 00:07:20,380
offenses amnesty images absolutely but

106
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:31,599
if I wouldn't recommend a to that so um

107
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,470
let's go ahead and move on to entrance

108
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,729
off so the Wi-Fi and the sinkholes so

109
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,110
here we're gonna cover the Wi-Fi

110
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,130
pineapples the for longer he's gonna to

111
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,650
to world thank you for Miami you said

112
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,490
many times and I find multiple ones down

113
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,960
holes the owner got a fatty Bank which

114
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,300
recommended I personally use it a twenty

115
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,210
five thousand medium for all my devices

116
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:11,160
and that's right about it practice so

117
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,660
the parables I do strongly recommend

118
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,590
using the people for your go-to tool or

119
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,840
for Wi-Fi hack

120
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,470
I mean it it's really easy to use this

121
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,150
point when you're nuts and if you have

122
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,680
some people actually connected to you

123
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,590
you can use it as a back oh there's

124
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,159
plenty of modules to install or it

125
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,799
there's a lot of forms online if you

126
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,700
ever need help troubleshooting and also

127
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,650
though the GUI presentation instead of

128
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,270
the command line for example if if

129
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,680
you're in engagement you want to person

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,170
or whatever the GUI for taking

131
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,900
screenshots it makes it very very easy

132
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,470
to 2% to too many by third one to me

133
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,380
non-technical people so I love the

134
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,150
ability that once the device is actually

135
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,060
connected to to internet you can connect

136
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:27,630
it to see to server so sometimes you

137
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,910
might feel too hard and it might break

138
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:36,240
it and all years of use but that's over

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,330
20 30 times use but it is recommended to

140
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,660
carry a couple of you know just in case

141
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,470
you break it or something on this one

142
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,510
this is a screenshot of an example of

143
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,420
all the modules this is not the complete

144
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,010
list there is even more in the baby

145
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,960
constantly add

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,630
example one that this is this one for

147
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,510
temple or portals a great module for

148
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,130
example let's say you're having two

149
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,830
lockers at the end as you snatch the

150
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,140
credentials and you have a copy you can

151
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,300
actually replicate the captive portal

152
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,010
and then as soon as people's going to

153
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,970
see you the first thing that they're

154
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,410
going to see is that rule where they

155
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,920
have to log in so there's a finish as

156
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
well

157
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,380
the geotag that's if you want to be

158
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,430
extra friendly with all of your

159
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,980
neighbors if you know what I mean um the

160
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,650
wife right side surveys are a great tool

161
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,130
to see the power of all the places

162
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,800
pretty much a lot of modules that you

163
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,050
can actually install and take so as I

164
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,160
mentioned before I appreciate only for

165
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,030
this so this is made pretty much for my

166
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,250
can so I can pretty much you can

167
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,720
actually is a Pringles can

168
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,850
this is for a long range of Wi-Fi

169
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,000
hacking um personally I've successfully

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,970
tested it to slightly over 500 meters

171
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,150
[Music]

172
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,380
just find a local coffee shop clearly to

173
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,520
the building is pointing you're gonna be

174
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,940
able to pick up traffic there so just be

175
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,720
piped almost everybody knows about them

176
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,700
so some of them can actually be used for

177
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,400
what I'm happy it's easily one of the

178
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,140
cheapest items on their presentation at

179
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,450
the time of me training this I actually

180
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,490
saw one on Amazon which is one of the

181
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,910
alphas 2.45 range from $5 which is this

182
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,950
small one right here it's pretty small

183
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,830
where you can see a little portable I've

184
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,560
heard of another graphical and it's

185
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,790
supposed to be that really good for

186
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,860
backing injection well personally I have

187
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,750
not tried them yet but I've heard

188
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:25,589
interviews from them some before nagashi

189
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,660
this is something I came out a couple of

190
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,780
months ago and lead a presentation on

191
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,110
attorney

192
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,620
meter and is a fantastic device like

193
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,839
once you say there it's actually on the

194
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,980
back units are three by with a screen

195
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,040
attached to it once you install me you

196
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,709
let it run like or have you take it with

197
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,920
you though starts getting pretty active

198
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,430
white rice ill D off and as soon as each

199
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,110
other you can they don't automatically

200
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,730
cut for the handshake in this floor for

201
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,670
him like I've taken this force P drive

202
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,890
around the neighborhood pick up forty

203
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,190
fifty sixty Wi-Fi these and let's send

204
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,329
them at work easy

205
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,779
let's bring home take off all the P caps

206
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,240
onto my computer crack them and there

207
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:24,709
you go how to pee cups so moving on to

208
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:33,310
RFID RFID hacking is subject it's a more

209
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,890
advanced if you may but it is something

210
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:47,930
that is used commonly on whatever we use

211
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,779
which is RFID frequency diagnostic cards

212
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,170
on the proxmark the key C bar fight you

213
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:01,820
duplicator and the article yes so for

214
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,240
the fantasy in Diagnostics card these

215
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,760
you can actually pick up from someplace

216
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,740
they have all that but wonderfully from

217
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,970
dangerous things which is this one point

218
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,560
the black piece because since your wall

219
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,970
you can literally carry it everywhere

220
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,740
does anything and then there's some this

221
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,140
one on the right hand side corner which

222
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,329
is from pepper warehouse this one

223
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:28,579
actually carry as its teaching so the

224
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:32,149
cool thing about these two devices for

225
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,920
example winner we can walk us to Italy

226
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,990
and you see it's in order to get into

227
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,630
the lead in our part just take one of

228
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,820
these two devices and put it next to the

229
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,370
device and it'll let you know you can

230
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,970
utilize it's actually low frequency

231
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,079
or high frequency Oh you wonder why

232
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,389
you're actually using the contour

233
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:03,769
learning to - you must know if they're

234
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,060
using low frequency or high frequency in

235
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,529
order to get into the building if that's

236
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,660
the main thing that they did apparently

237
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,959
useful there are right across so the

238
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:23,560
confort my view is a wide beam own and

239
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:36,319
RFID cloning as well one of the features

240
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:37,939
of the contract theory this is already

241
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,459
before the one who uses our argue before

242
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,000
um is that you can actually synchronize

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,519
it with your Bluetooth on your phone and

244
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,680
used tools for example you can use of

245
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,879
RFID tool research group and also

246
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,910
project walrus so with these tools um

247
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,639
for example let's say hearing a red team

248
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,860
and you could be looking at your phone

249
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,930
while I'm having the time synchronized

250
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,329
with your phone and then that person

251
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,490
helping you then you walk up to someone

252
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,769
profile and then try to clone the device

253
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:18,290
and you can happen all actually in

254
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,980
comparison to the to the proxmark versus

255
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,059
other IDs

256
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,769
you have an agenda proximities it you

257
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:29,000
can actually get successfully something

258
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,839
about two inches margin space of how

259
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,699
close you actually need to be clarified

260
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:42,170
in order to go from park is a little bit

261
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,300
expensive currently a hacker world

262
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,589
stickers for 320 and that's without the

263
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,680
bluetooth module on the battery you can

264
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,569
actually fit up for it so you can go

265
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:56,179
completely wireless if you add those two

266
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,630
modules is going to

267
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,199
something but it's a popsicle so half of

268
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,750
you if you're doing alright so another

269
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,189
tool that I find I literally carry with

270
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,530
my car keys and everything is a key see

271
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,130
RFID duplicator this is Lydia that I've

272
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,900
done research is one of the cheapest

273
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,789
RFID cloning device is that you can

274
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,039
actually find currently I decide two

275
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,089
days ago on Amazon for $40

276
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,820
it's super super super easy to use like

277
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,260
they do just hold on one of the buttons

278
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,360
put it close to the chronograph though

279
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,370
you're trying to clone and within a

280
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,659
couple seconds you're gonna have as I

281
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,980
mentioned you can carry it on occasion

282
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,440
that's a tiger with me all time where

283
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,470
every good sir this actually has the

284
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,080
ability store multiple cards for example

285
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,950
this one right here you can actually

286
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,860
clone one card to device it comes with

287
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,950
it and then you can store for more on

288
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,340
each one of these bottles the one of the

289
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,830
disadvantage device is that it's only

290
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,470
available for a little frequency but if

291
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,789
if he go on it's not really that much of

292
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,890
a disadvantage to tip back a lot of

293
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,600
companies a lot of business out there

294
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,980
and most of them they actually useful

295
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,490
for Plessy for the RFID so this one does

296
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,280
require a very quantitative to being

297
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,530
glowing but you may wonder like why

298
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,919
Amazon is selling this pencil they

299
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,200
actually promote it not exactly as an

300
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,890
RFID fantasy device but they promote it

301
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,059
as a device for example if you have to

302
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,400
go into your community or the gates to

303
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,130
go into or the door for the garage and

304
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,620
why not you can actually pull all those

305
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,240
cards and just her eyes one without how

306
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,909
he's prepped to carry multiple cards so

307
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:51,159
that's how they promote it so moving on

308
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,850
for the Thunder are interesting this is

309
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,409
I think they consider yes one of the

310
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,799
best tools for RFID hacking which is

311
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,130
called RDS D key so it's an important

312
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,470
ones and when you plug in e you can

313
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,770
really be in and out in time

314
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,080
but it easily take your law less than

315
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,020
that so this is the actual device

316
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,309
it's wandering into the size of a stand

317
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,110
so half words is that for example you

318
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,230
walk to building and the entry door of

319
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,030
the building you'll have the scanner for

320
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,420
the RFID cards so if you actually take a

321
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,720
pawn that's drinking the waters and

322
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,900
liberty new in here and assembly here so

323
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,510
you can actually intercept report and a

324
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,460
rubric that replay the credentials that

325
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,300
you're actually scanning for the wires

326
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,520
so no matter your record it literally

327
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,770
gets its power from from all the tables

328
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,330
on here at you can extrude being a

329
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,300
Natasha to it and the beauty of it is

330
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,570
that it actually has Wi-Fi capability so

331
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,309
you can actually set up this point so

332
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,290
whenever you can actually leave the

333
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,480
divine so home come back a week later

334
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,050
and they can influence it through the

335
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,490
device and then you can bring down all

336
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,250
the download all those credential your

337
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,100
that you're actually scored on the price

338
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,170
not only that soon you can see it he

339
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,770
besides downloading traditionally

340
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,420
destroyed you can actually replay them

341
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,920
it open the door famously so that can be

342
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,370
a hundred or yes thank you

343
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,840
so it's a fantastic tool and the size

344
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,820
and a Charlie once you install it

345
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,179
there's no way out almost no way of

346
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,760
detecting it like for example if someone

347
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,410
is actually monitoring traffic going

348
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,520
through they're not going to know that

349
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
this device actually is there it's a

350
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,150
man-in-the-middle so talking about the

351
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,090
soapy foam on the implants

352
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,390
let's move on to two other devices so

353
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,670
mindful thing implants this is easily

354
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,350
one if I get quite a favorite subjects

355
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,870
teacher the nature of these pink small

356
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,790
toys actives whatever you want to call

357
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,270
them so starting off with the shark act

358
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,230
the charge act is another small device

359
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,490
that had

360
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,700
Angelo Ricky chase another fantastic

361
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,570
product five let's say you walk into

362
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,820
recession if you man hey one of those

363
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,320
boy phones voice over IP you can thanks

364
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,920
to the boy yeah or you can let's say

365
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,680
it's just for our next report you can

366
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,080
literally plug in this device let it run

367
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,730
and in less than two minutes you can do

368
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,490
a port scan of their network so it's a

369
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,540
great topic to order reconnaissance so

370
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,830
behind the actual device its device it

371
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,480
actually has a Linux operating system

372
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,700
run helmet so you can actually modify

373
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,040
scripts that you want for example if you

374
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,820
want certain sin taxes or or tax on the

375
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,340
IMF wrinkled skin you can actually set

376
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,850
it up there the battery life on it runs

377
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,300
for about seven minutes I've been lucky

378
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,500
some friends I think then actually get

379
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,180
it to run eight wait you have an X

380
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,200
depending on what I'm actually doing

381
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,170
with it another feature I mean is that

382
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,630
since it when you have soon as you plug

383
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,070
it in it will run as a DHCP so what

384
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,320
first wait and support skin so once the

385
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,040
IP is in proportion to the advantage is

386
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,910
that you can synchronize and upload the

387
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,880
ports and results to your remote server

388
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,280
or you can actually that's a great solar

389
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,500
ranking going to building you plug into

390
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,370
a wall jack a t-bone your port skin

391
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,170
two-minute songs then I'll upload the

392
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,330
results to your to your bone server so

393
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,340
by the time that you're leaving ability

394
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:23,740
already so yeah so another implant is

395
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,300
the rubber ducky

396
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,640
for physical confessing I'd say this is

397
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,960
the most famous device for a purpose I

398
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,450
mean everybody's for about anybody says

399
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,360
copy it it's one of the most commonly

400
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,100
used us

401
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,970
- Oscar for Freitag's there is a really

402
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,860
really large support on blogs and forums

403
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,169
for the rubber ducky

404
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,470
dozens of piglets where target of all of

405
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,590
these there you have to copy paste a

406
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,929
great one that I've seen being used with

407
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:57,330
it is many cats for example you can have

408
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,450
broken up get with it gets installed and

409
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,010
let's say you walk around the office and

410
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,429
then that office has a computer that is

411
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,049
not locked out or just locked you can

412
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,610
letter you plug in the device with baby

413
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,850
cats and you know snatched credits and

414
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,200
then after that you can take an almond

415
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,240
and decoded so another tool that

416
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,400
developers are great for is a coder and

417
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,530
corner website or software if you're

418
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,809
doing something custom or you want

419
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,730
specific payloads in one on you can

420
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,970
actually go to doc calm and from there

421
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,100
you can actually craft exactly what you

422
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,980
want to do I've seen payloads there all

423
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,190
the way from firewall evasion to port

424
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,200
scans to many different things it all

425
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,400
depends on what you want to do now

426
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,770
concerns about uses a for example or one

427
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,539
of the comments uses I go into a parking

428
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:51,720
lot

429
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,270
drop young Trump being close to live in

430
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,159
45 minutes as if someone picks it up and

431
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,190
oppose any other from here you might be

432
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,679
still living skeptic that I am Oh Leanna

433
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,450
points that cost $50 behind you know a

434
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,590
karmic smashing or something or nobody

435
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,049
might dig down 20 lessons does the ring

436
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,440
what I've heard my damage so discovered

437
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,299
in Atlantic often which is the TT

438
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,270
sparked these I literally purchased on

439
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,720
full through through ebay you can get up

440
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,240
like two three dollars each and if you

441
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,590
can actually get the same results and

442
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,409
with the DC smart it is a little bit

443
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,900
more complicated but at the same time

444
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
there's a lot of blogs and forums online

445
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,539
the rich on sale gets or from there and

446
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,059
also similar to the ducks will kid I've

447
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,669
discovered this smart and quarter

448
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,299
compiler which is an issue - support the

449
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,920
Iowa and then typically you can actually

450
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,950
hurry hurry coats so they can work for

451
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:04,090
the spark so secondary signal implants

452
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,210
um what I love about this one is the

453
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,710
persistence like the other devices

454
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,980
usually just plug in one time use that's

455
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,170
how you get your results or not but this

456
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,360
one it's literally a shell like you're

457
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,300
gonna be there I could need 24/7 and

458
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,820
whatever you want to like for example

459
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,180
here is a tweet from 2016 from from Bo

460
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,610
from Black Hills that he was actually

461
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,430
using the lantern or for a purpose in a

462
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,740
very like on the other hand it's just a

463
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,350
USB and on this end it's a rj45

464
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,740
connection so the beauty of it is that

465
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,350
it is length space and at the end of the

466
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,900
other half I fancy I could have multiple

467
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,590
modules of it all to to install for

468
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,080
example there's a screenshot of all the

469
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,670
modules available and also as same as

470
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,980
the other devices actually has the

471
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,920
ability to to upload the results to the

472
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,920
command and control server which if you

473
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,690
have let's say on a digital ocean PS um

474
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,120
you can have it literally available for

475
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,590
you to 24/7 do whatever it's going to be

476
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:26,780
set to do and then upload the results so

477
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,820
this is another device that actually

478
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,840
came out and the market a couple weeks

479
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,330
ago it is another party from from

480
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,410
recently imported I have yet to play

481
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:52,820
much with it it is actually the modules

482
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,580
and aliens for it kudos to them on the

483
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,670
fantastic work they're doing so there

484
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,660
are other key loggers available with

485
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,630
similar features the reason why I picked

486
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,020
this one versus the other one is the

487
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,220
ability of this one actually as well

488
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,770
being able to to connect to a remote

489
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,660
server and you can actually manage it

490
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,870
remotely so it does have also Wi-Fi

491
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,670
antenna that you can actually connect to

492
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,070
a Wi-Fi set that you actually have set

493
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:27,080
up and it's nearly undetectable and not

494
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,670
only that this one actually has another

495
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,340
feature versus the other key loggers is

496
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,470
that this one can literally

497
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,950
scan the computer is plugged into and

498
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:45,380
it'll pick up the serial and it can

499
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,510
actually Emily almost if you have you

500
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:52,060
single one of the devices so it's almost

501
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:04,090
so this is also commonly known as

502
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,630
Dropbox this is a fantastic fantastic

503
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,770
device if you set it up correctly due to

504
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,390
the fact that it can give you remote

505
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,180
access to your Wi-Fi hacking your cell

506
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,140
on to I have no wife I think beyond the

507
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,900
network remotely so I know that the

508
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,380
Dropbox you will need a Raspberry Pi

509
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,670
person you use their effort by four with

510
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,930
countenance following

511
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,110
um I would recommend using as well Wi-Fi

512
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,420
or the Wi-Fi hacking whatever you're

513
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,580
gonna work off a mobile home park advice

514
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,100
and actually use their a cellphone or

515
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,309
one of those hot sauce you can buy a

516
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:52,460
couple of t-mobile Sprint AT&T you can I

517
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,679
would also strongly recommend using a

518
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:57,590
high capacity power bank dudes if I

519
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,090
could since you're gonna have all these

520
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,580
devices instead of a container for

521
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,440
example a pelican box and drop it off

522
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,860
somewhere and since you're gonna be

523
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,899
diggin for X amount of powers eighty

524
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:11,330
days at a time you want high-capacity

525
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,980
from the power bank so one example word

526
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,039
you would use Dropbox let's say you're

527
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,049
doing a physical practice into a

528
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,200
building and in order to get to the

529
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,419
building office let's say you're going

530
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:27,980
to the third floor or the fourth floor

531
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,450
for example and you see that my

532
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,190
challenge in order to get into the

533
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,260
actual office yeah you might be able to

534
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,120
have it to the Wi-Fi and let's say that

535
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,139
on the same floor and they have a

536
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:41,389
publicly accessible restroom you might

537
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:43,250
be able to go into the restaurant they

538
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,539
have one of those tiles you can actually

539
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:46,130
lift them you can take them put them

540
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,559
Pelican box with all your devices inside

541
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,990
and active you pop it onto the roof

542
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,029
close the ceiling and just enough you

543
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,190
have the boat long sense to the device

544
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,289
and then what promote axis you can take

545
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:03,350
archetype of the bone so in my

546
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,440
experience or galley and hot spots

547
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,490
usually carriers they don't allow for

548
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,370
forwarding or rowdy for the political

549
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,649
piece for the hospital devices so I

550
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:19,610
would recommend which allows for already

551
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,059
I personally use PIAA there's many

552
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:24,559
solutions out there and Buchanan's on

553
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,519
subject but yeah you will need a you can

554
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:36,110
with or forward capabilities so moving

555
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,549
on to block the key and bypassing um for

556
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,080
luck I can't buy I think there's

557
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,610
literally a lot of tools um this is a

558
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,950
list of compound the ones that are used

559
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,950
the most on there are others

560
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,580
a complete list there's new tools new

561
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,580
locks coming out so we're going to be

562
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,130
talking about lock picks door shared

563
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,740
origin pile auction and cylinder shams

564
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,429
monkeys etc and the differences between

565
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:14,059
each so moving on so law fix if you

566
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,330
actually Google and search you know life

567
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,789
you will see there is a large large

568
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:24,980
large variety on lock picks on my honest

569
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,289
opinion is if you've never unlocked

570
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:29,240
picked before I recommend getting one of

571
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,269
those bundles that come off of ebay or

572
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,010
amazon but they have like one of those

573
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,139
transparent logs for you to practice and

574
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,409
or not but there's a little longer and

575
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,570
they you want to invest into quality

576
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,490
products I recommend for example phone

577
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,250
from Sparrow from southern Earth from

578
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,200
survey regiment at red tint Wars so I

579
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,659
would recommend to invest into a politic

580
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:54,279
bonnet

581
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,899
Ruth Wiggins and performance of lock

582
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,710
picks you've probably seen it there's

583
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,779
different designs of them for example

584
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:07,250
the ones that you can see on this

585
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,850
picture are actually the reason why I

586
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,529
use these

587
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:14,630
versus other ones is that these ones are

588
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,190
very small and they're actually very

589
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,909
thin sometimes you might find a lot that

590
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:22,039
you're actually it's a little bit hard

591
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,549
to get into so by having a thick divine

592
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:27,500
so you can actually scale it easier and

593
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,409
you can have a better contact from the

594
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,460
actual picks when you're doing

595
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,159
individual thinking for example the ones

596
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,380
that crumble like covered with a rubber

597
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,779
grip or a plastic brick yeah I mean

598
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,909
those can be a lot more comfortable if

599
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:43,250
you're taking a lot of time in order to

600
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,470
pick a lock but at the same time I don't

601
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,850
like it if I don't provide enough

602
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,029
feedback that I've you and then I can

603
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,860
get with that I can get our cheap with

604
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,399
these so on this picture I actually have

605
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,220
this is the set of lock picks that I use

606
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,049
this is from sparrow

607
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:03,230
this was called the dark shift is from

608
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,029
Ferris also this is called

609
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:07,849
after who after ray it's a fantastic

610
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,859
rate for raking it's another good

611
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,168
technique for a lock-picking and these

612
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:14,239
are the BOGO does these I got from Sara

613
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,129
baked these are actually made of

614
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:22,190
titanium and from titanium now props and

615
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,190
kudos to to the Bogota because Liberty

616
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,460
I'd say 70 percent of all launch and

617
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,899
doors that I've come across with it I

618
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,079
felt they had to bake these two can

619
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,509
literally get the job done and it's it's

620
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:38,750
a fantastic product on these I very

621
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,940
would be that I can fit I'm gonna wall

622
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,649
it I can conceal them pretty much any

623
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:44,509
work you can really see in the picture

624
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:46,039
behind that feels a little a little

625
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,899
spring from a pen that I took apart in

626
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,489
order to attach together so that I don't

627
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:52,518
lose them or anything but fantastic set

628
00:34:52,518 --> 00:35:01,460
of things so for door sheds um this is a

629
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,970
tool that can be used on doors and it's

630
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,269
usually dead latch is a little bit it's

631
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:11,599
usually sits right right here for

632
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,190
example these kind of this kind of

633
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,960
lenses you can easily see your source

634
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,509
you're on general looms usually on doors

635
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:23,119
already inside offices so the door

636
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,589
things are actually made out of plastic

637
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,380
it can be manufactured with plastic

638
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,490
items like for example those the gallons

639
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,920
of milk or juice once you found with

640
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,049
them you can actually cut them out and

641
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:38,000
you can actually cut a shape similar to

642
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,759
this which can help you do the shaping

643
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:45,109
with this so they're the way to use them

644
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,240
it's pretty samples cannot like the old

645
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,160
credit card if you just take it out

646
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,289
sliding through the door and it's going

647
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,789
to open the door with you for you

648
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,529
without having to even picked or

649
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:59,359
anything so another thing to keep in

650
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,440
mind and set for example these as I'll

651
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,680
show the next slide for example on this

652
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,240
latch on this side of the door you can

653
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,029
actually see the latch on sometimes for

654
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:16,730
example this one you can actually push

655
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,660
in

656
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,019
but it's the door that right here pulley

657
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:24,289
like for example do you have those you

658
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,910
have doors that go anywhere I go outward

659
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,220
chances are that on some doors you might

660
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,859
not be able to to have visibly on the

661
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,289
plate and strike plate although of the

662
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:37,640
actual latch so advantage of using the

663
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,380
plastic portions is you can actually

664
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,440
slide still if you need the door and I

665
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,890
could be able to hit the latch so we'll

666
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,549
be onto the gorgeous this is a common

667
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:56,150
tool for opening doors and one that I

668
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,589
actually have used to switch at carrier

669
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:12,920
and then this is a one versus the

670
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,589
plastic one that this one can only used

671
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:17,779
on doors on which you have a little

672
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:20,720
latch like this one if the door has a

673
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,569
CEO and it's calmer then you're not

674
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,940
going to be able to use it but at the

675
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,730
same time it's versatile as in you can

676
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,710
actually use it in a push-pull direction

677
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,349
for example if the latch is facing

678
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,509
inward or if the latch is facing our

679
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:38,000
either way as long as you have

680
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,559
visibility you can actually use this

681
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,490
world order to open it so you can find

682
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,079
these online in different sizes and

683
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,230
wanna and surprisingly these can can

684
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,710
also be crafted for example if you're if

685
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,539
you have an old credit card is expired

686
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,700
and wanna you can actually take the

687
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,230
credit card which is the same size as

688
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,259
this and cut out these shapes and

689
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:02,299
believing the credit card will actually

690
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:10,099
work as well also just to you guys know

691
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:12,230
I have mentioned a lot of box from from

692
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,259
sparrows in high five however they have

693
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,650
not paid any for for the publicity or

694
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,289
anything I just give them kudos for

695
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:23,599
their fantastic honors and then to be

696
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,849
one of the NBC moment devices actually

697
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,950
purchase with my own money system what

698
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,189
you guys

699
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:35,209
so moving on to paddle auctions I was

700
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:38,929
not aware of the existence of padlock

701
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:41,509
shins until one time I saw a video a

702
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:45,319
lock-picking lawyer on YouTube and I was

703
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,390
amazed of how easy it is to open a lock

704
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,119
with these devices like these are also

705
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,979
available in Spanish you can pick up

706
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,559
prici also an eBay Amazon they're

707
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,630
literally intimate so they look like

708
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,979
this these are actually covered in a

709
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:00,079
rubber um the ones that I got from stars

710
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,929
or not don't depend on whichever you

711
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:05,989
prefer so how they work it's pretty

712
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:07,849
simple you pretty much just wrap it

713
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:11,900
around the house like like show here on

714
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,029
this picture and slide it down so it's

715
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,189
actually gonna push this device back and

716
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,140
then I'm trying within a couple of

717
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:25,489
seconds you're gonna have lock open so

718
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,609
moving on to the other vintage amps was

719
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:31,849
a which is a southern portions this is a

720
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:35,869
great tool in order to to open up

721
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:38,209
cylinders if they're actually a little

722
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,239
bit loose so for example and in each one

723
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,689
there's a regular law without the key

724
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,969
inside you can see that the pants are

725
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:52,009
completely image on image to is using a

726
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:56,089
random key so you can see the pins you

727
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,779
know are not matching Sandri they're

728
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,809
using the property and from there you

729
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,729
can actually see at the aerial to open

730
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:06,589
the lock see every single thing is

731
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:09,769
matching however how the court shim

732
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:14,209
works is that it inserted above the core

733
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:16,849
hitting the first pin and the emanuelly

734
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,670
take each pin so you picked the first

735
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,259
thing you push it for a little bit

736
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:24,469
deeper yes I can pin you push the poor

737
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,449
even a little bit more deeper the shape

738
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:28,519
to the core keeper

739
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,679
and so on so until you get every single

740
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,199
thing and you're gonna be opening either

741
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,559
log DC easy so here is actually a sample

742
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,269
video that he actually does the portions

743
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,570
and also the

744
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:53,040
the torch is 1200 courtesy so bunkies

745
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,710
monkeys is another tool that I've used

746
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,920
in order to tickets to those sometimes

747
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,330
you'll find those stores and artists

748
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,420
really really hard to bake a bump key is

749
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,030
a great way of ensuring door look it

750
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,390
easy

751
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,630
um so how it works is how it's displayed

752
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,800
here on this gift is that these parts of

753
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,140
the key actually strike the pins with

754
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,050
fours Nicky Amaro of at the same time so

755
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,530
once I go up Jimmy to Lisicki with the

756
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,320
the force it actually open up and hold

757
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,920
the the pins on top

758
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,130
the only disadvantage of using keys is

759
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,830
that it can be really really really loud

760
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,900
like for some point for trying to go

761
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,580
early in the morning into a building

762
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,830
attractive but discreet maybe have

763
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,390
security guards walk around building

764
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,000
when I start to panic chances are that

765
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,080
they're gonna eat hear you knocking hard

766
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,030
on the keys while trying to you to

767
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,120
moments the door so yeah that's pretty

768
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,530
much the only disadvantage of room

769
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,860
besides that a great great tool for

770
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:17,920
testing so your keys um yes yes or even

771
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,190
available on ebay um Howard's it's a

772
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,360
nature of that subject it can be very

773
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,510
complicated can also dangerous so I'm

774
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,460
not going to be talking about it this

775
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,330
presentation maybe one another can you

776
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,880
go up and down and if you're interested

777
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,900
on more on there's a great time on that

778
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,640
you get all I'm presented on easy you

779
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,830
can actually watch it there you can

780
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,110
learn a lot more about a little bit

781
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:54,810
you're happy there so the phone keys

782
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,010
I've always questioned

783
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,040
someone like why would you bother block

784
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,810
baking if you already have a key so a

785
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:10,109
lot of companies manufacture products

786
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:13,540
such as automobiles such as intercom

787
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,650
devices such as filing counties and they

788
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,060
have a lot of companies actually use the

789
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,460
same default keys for literally

790
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,980
everything so one of the tools that I

791
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,460
carry with me is a a set of default keys

792
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,470
that are commonly used everywhere

793
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,050
for example I actually got this one off

794
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,109
a bikini for example you have the L key

795
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:38,400
one let's do two three four three

796
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,890
you have the one two eight four when you

797
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,260
have to walk the aim once saves yeah

798
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,380
many known keys that are used for some

799
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,600
forty two chrome systems for finally

800
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,050
comments or certificates for temple

801
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,230
North London's being one for example the

802
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,990
one to form is actually the common

803
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,750
foreign fleet cars and on this day you

804
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,690
can actually verify that all part what's

805
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,290
up with walking on I don't know Beach or

806
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,020
something you see I'm not suggesting

807
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:15,160
anything but just don't do it on them I

808
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,490
see you're an authorized you know a

809
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,920
little tip on the one two three four we

810
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,450
all know it's a crumb cake and it's

811
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,660
displayed here but just chromic it's not

812
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,630
only a pattern we all know the multiple

813
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,980
uses and or has been useful or but yeah

814
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,640
here you can actually see a video of the

815
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,100
one to a for being is to in order to

816
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:50,680
open maybe turn on the car so you would

817
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,250
wonder why you would use a be funky

818
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,170
percent for him to come low and say if

819
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,550
you're practicing a community or solar

820
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,850
Express system by using the default key

821
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,770
to open the the intercom which is

822
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,750
commonly used for actually servicing

823
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,910
here you have access to the flow diagram

824
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,450
and the beauty of it is it if you

825
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,390
actually do some little googling and

826
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,819
some researcher one into each channel

827
00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:21,440
and their manufacturer or not chances

828
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,180
are you're gonna find their manual and

829
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,039
what know chances are you gonna find the

830
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:30,440
cable specification such as these kind I

831
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,180
think you find open the available that

832
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,980
are youth where Sookie jigglers I teach

833
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,559
another fantastic tool that I use this

834
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,380
is commonly used for wafer locks public

835
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,770
rings and other devices for example

836
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,039
there's a lot of videos online of used

837
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:53,780
in order to open a lot of pork or

838
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,359
especially I think one of the most

839
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:58,970
common once the user is three in the

840
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,150
middle one of them is actually called

841
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:06,289
the one one key to rule all but yeah

842
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:08,270
it's a great tool to Karen for example

843
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,579
sometimes you find those cabinet logs

844
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,109
that they they're just completely

845
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:14,089
unthinkable and just something the

846
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:16,460
jiggler keys to are deeply and chests

847
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,420
are with a couple of minutes you

848
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,200
actually opening that love here's

849
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,420
another sample video apology which is

850
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,190
being used this one is actually used on

851
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,279
a vehicle and yeah it's a great little

852
00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:30,559
town here to you're out on all yeah is

853
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,140
nothing wrong and saying agender you

854
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,819
carry on with your with your regular

855
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:41,270
piece wherever you go to so another tool

856
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,089
that I used to be surprised is the

857
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:48,500
compressed air so thanks to fire right

858
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,380
in front of regulations depends on one I

859
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,880
do you believe this applies for every

860
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,640
single state um whenever Yahoo building

861
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,940
has access control or RFID in order to

862
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,309
exit the building they have requested

863
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:04,039
accident sensor so if you notice that's

864
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:05,299
what it's here actually but bill there's

865
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:07,460
a device on top of the door it's

866
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,930
actually pointing in the direction of

867
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,849
people walking towards the door so when

868
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,480
it says it's a thermal temperature of

869
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,859
someone actually walking transport

870
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:17,990
they'll open the door unlocked door kind

871
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,309
of allows you to exit the engineer or

872
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,650
the about

873
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,920
is that by using prints and you can

874
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,100
simulate the change of temperature and

875
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,350
actually unlock the hot side but just

876
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,140
literally you flip the the prints later

877
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,870
I'll tell you down with a nozzle you're

878
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,550
pressing through the door and I'll spray

879
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,680
the air into the inside so the drastic

880
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,390
change of temperature will actually let

881
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,180
the there's some change of temperature

882
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,630
and I literally want the door for you so

883
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,360
there's a few sample videos here that

884
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,230
whenever one is actually got with

885
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,490
compressed air as you can see here I can

886
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,500
actually done with the beep as well and

887
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,560
another option which you do was with

888
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,540
using whiskey however that one if you're

889
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,190
actually not a hard job I wouldn't

890
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:12,320
recommend doing another advance of these

891
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,820
does that supposedly I've heard that you

892
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,550
can actually take a frozen piece of

893
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:19,400
newspaper or magazine and slide it into

894
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,230
the door it's supposed to be that works

895
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:27,410
as well personally and there's another

896
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,780
technique youth for example sometimes in

897
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,420
some offices they will take the request

898
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,460
to exit Center and actually put it up

899
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,950
Kewpie away from that from the door so

900
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,630
you might think oh ok so that and the

901
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,330
press here might not work when you find

902
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,050
hassan ezzat

903
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,410
instead you actually take oh you're able

904
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,010
to you take a balloon you inflate it

905
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,980
with air and when you pump the balloon

906
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,470
through the like you put you put the

907
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,670
balloon through the edge of the doors

908
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,580
you blow it aside and with cool things

909
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,500
on the balloon flying in here represents

910
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,980
a chair as well so two other tool that I

911
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,790
use for my for my fan testing one is a

912
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,510
UDT yet awareness and ket so these are

913
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,520
called the under door tool and the

914
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,880
double or to the double board tool so

915
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,890
for example sometimes you'll find this

916
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,320
is commonly found in for example in

917
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,790
schools and big buildings would have a

918
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,830
little lot of employees and one half

919
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,930
that they need regularly for fire goods

920
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,330
in Arma to to open also

921
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,430
so for example here's picture of the

922
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,280
Dumbledore tool being used like you just

923
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,160
I think the the door it's not installed

924
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,870
correctly and it doesn't have the means

925
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,880
in order to protect in the middle you

926
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,560
just pop this tool in between and you

927
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,500
can just pull this and within seconds

928
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,130
you're gonna be able to beat that door

929
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:02,600
so another fantastic tool is the under

930
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:08,140
the door tool for this one yeah there's

931
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,900
music thanks to two particle regulations

932
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,890
as well um officers are not reported to

933
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,180
have no set of a knob so due to the park

934
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,270
of regulation and then having the the

935
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,960
handle on it by log of the hashtag so

936
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,530
this is another perfect opening of the

937
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:33,830
handles on Wars the only disadvantage of

938
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,390
these tools is that they can be

939
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,850
disaffected they made they can't be a

940
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,500
little bit a little bit hard to conceal

941
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,910
sign effect they're great cleansing

942
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:51,770
tools so other physical confessing tools

943
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,710
I don't recommend carrying with you or

944
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,600
using a drone purge to be on his face Oh

945
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,320
personally I II actually have a DGI all

946
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,210
those can be a little bit expensive but

947
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,460
I use it for as a hobby find your own

948
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,080
and also taking pictures whenever I'm

949
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,570
princess I think you know a physical

950
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,220
picture know the layout of the building

951
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,740
let's say first time I can't see the

952
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,440
back side of the building Google Maps I

953
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,180
just probably droning I can take

954
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,890
pictures of the back see wherever they

955
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,880
have cameras so we're hot doors I might

956
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,320
be able to bring out through the second

957
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,330
third or building see if there's someone

958
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,470
inside another tool you might want to

959
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,680
use is a flashlight that's always good

960
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,910
to carry I would also recommend using a

961
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,930
multi-tool pliers for example my

962
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,150
experience uh that's a here on

963
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,190
engagement and you're trying to open up

964
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:55,860
a door you forgot your office and it

965
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,390
turns out you're carrying with you the

966
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,220
multi-tool pliers and you have a can of

967
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,120
soda with the can of soda you can

968
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,240
actually charge not forget the blog

969
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,400
pixel you forgot your portions with the

970
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,050
chemists soda and the multipliers you

971
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,850
can actually cut out the shape of the

972
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:14,250
portions and let me just make it on the

973
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,050
spot

974
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,870
um a radio if you're in teeming

975
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,850
answering or any attached indication or

976
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,110
if your team is anything to report

977
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,260
something I would also advise to carry

978
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,060
with you water and snacks you know

979
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,880
sometimes your candor can take an hour

980
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,800
to maybe if it's complicated or a

981
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,650
building or whatever and chances are

982
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,110
you're gonna find any water or snacks so

983
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,560
you want carry something with you in

984
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,690
regards to three slides I mentioned I'm

985
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,480
talking about fake badge or for the

986
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,790
social engineering however in this case

987
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,680
I do also strongly recommend carrying

988
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,570
with you proper anything identification

989
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:55,230
just a case I've got familiar your your

990
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,960
cots and they call it a law enforcement

991
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,610
woman you will need to present yourself

992
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:04,860
and what are you doing at 100 is

993
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,480
definitely not once especially nowadays

994
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,130
with the whole corona virus pandemic

995
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,640
going on and sometimes you'll open up a

996
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:18,960
door you go into an office I'm sorry

997
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,630
employees I'm just not clean enough and

998
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,760
you'll see that their desk is a complete

999
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,700
ass and it's just trying to say this is

1000
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,980
utterly disgusting so you want to carry

1001
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,480
with you hand sometimes is just you know

1002
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,860
thing you're having one off your neck

1003
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,570
but not able to wash by a restaurant so

1004
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,200
whether you also want to carry a camera

1005
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,620
to take all pictures and videos are very

1006
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,330
the process of the Panthers engagement

1007
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,920
order for you to its funnier reporter

1008
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,660
presented presented to your client or

1009
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,410
what we're sorry another tool to use is

1010
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,870
by not during a physical reconnaissance

1011
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,240
example if you're parked in the parking

1012
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,790
lot whatever from across the street a

1013
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,350
building you want to see who's there or

1014
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,930
not keep track of who's living

1015
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,500
building and finally obviously a laptop

1016
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,520
plate it will always need to tt let's

1017
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,290
say for a couple of tools just not

1018
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,820
working for whatever reason he needs a

1019
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,400
diagnostic tool or troubleshooting it's

1020
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,910
a great way to tell for example if

1021
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,260
you're able to basically can access

1022
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,190
sensitive to to the building and part of

1023
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,990
the target is that you are allowed to

1024
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:41,210
connect to it now what would keep me

1025
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,460
well I mean it's hard to say there's a

1026
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,080
lot of challenges out there a lot of the

1027
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,910
system's implemented but there's always

1028
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:56,480
a way of breaking something here so

1029
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,400
faces from where I acquired a little

1030
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,100
tools that I currently use also a couple

1031
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,050
of videos and channels look for examples

1032
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,820
you get all the money - there's

1033
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,630
lock-picking over others those are

1034
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,720
resources for learning unlock unit

1035
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,240
Pacific on testing so besides that um I

1036
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,270
you thank you for the presentation I

1037
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,150
hope you liked it and once again this

1038
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,890
was David for skin if you have any

1039
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,020
questions or a tricky job thank you I

1040
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:34,890
get a few some things I've noticed that

1041
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,800
I just kind of want to point out for out

1042
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,960
there for a cheap location for getting

1043
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,680
lockpicks don't overlook wish calm so I

1044
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,690
got all my co-workers last year for

1045
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,380
Christmas a very simple lock-picking

1046
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,660
sitcom it was like two bucks has set it

1047
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,220
was literally nothing it wasn't the

1048
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,960
greatest set in the world but very great

1049
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,110
for someone that was just starting off

1050
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,730
the second thing I noticed with regard

1051
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,150
to flashlight recommendation always use

1052
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,520
an LED flashlight never use an

1053
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,680
incandescent flashlight and the reason

1054
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,090
for that is because a lot of your

1055
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,030
company's older security camera systems

1056
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,550
will not be able to see an LED

1057
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,960
flashlight so anything that you're

1058
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,760
shining around is not going to illumine

1059
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,130
the camera just tonette out there and of

1060
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,900
course lastly always to make sure that

1061
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,460
you have your get-out-of-jail-free paper

1062
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,590
assigned by the company that defines

1063
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,200
what the scope of your pen test is so

1064
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,000
especially right now with looting and

1065
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,980
all that crap going on you can hand that

1066
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,930
up real quick and not get beat down or

1067
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:41,640
shot alright I know thank you very much

1068
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,960
Dave I know that you were answering

1069
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,600
questions in the chat however I wanted

1070
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,370
to give everybody an opportunity if you

1071
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,950
want to put something in chat or if you

1072
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,480
want to unmute yourself and ask a

1073
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,240
question or make a comment you can do

1074
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,960
that now

1075
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:01,470
everybody a chance to do that alright

1076
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,360
well I think Dave answered almost all

1077
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,720
the questions in chat anyway so wanted

1078
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,820
to I mean it was a live demo

1079
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,760
presentation just wanted to do a live

1080
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,540
display business aprox Mart so it

1081
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,280
actually is on and wired and

1082
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,560
synchronized to my phone so right now it

1083
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,990
is scanning completely wirelessly this

1084
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:23,850
is a Diagnostics card which would show

1085
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:26,430
you if it's scanning high frequency or

1086
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,170
low frequency so just by bringing it

1087
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:29,730
together it'll actually indicate

1088
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,890
immediately so that's a sample both

1089
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,360
tools there oh wow oh yeah the thing

1090
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,860
else too for that and I was taking a

1091
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,080
look at consider instead of a regular

1092
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,050
clipboard what we called a posse box so

1093
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,790
it's the biggest a big thick plastic

1094
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,950
clipboard you have space inside of you

1095
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,960
could easily hide electronic equipment

1096
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,310
that can actually pick up on all that

1097
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,650
stuff I've seen a lot of people do that

1098
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,470
and of course myself anywhere I go if

1099
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,700
I'm gonna be going into like a telco

1100
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,470
closet I always make sure I have a

1101
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,060
hardhat and always make sure I'm wearing

1102
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,180
a reflective vest oh yeah and uniforms

1103
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,980
you can actually just go to a local

1104
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,210
thrift shop and pick up pretty much

1105
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:09,960
anything for like five dollars no UPS

1106
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,230
FEDEX yeah he just my father can hear

1107
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:20,040

make you the presenter and you should be

1122
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,960
able to select which monitor you want to

1123

share perfect all right it's all yours

1124
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,720
thanks thank Allison thank you my name

1125
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,010
is Henry I also do pen testing and red

1126
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:20,670
teaming and one of the things that I

1127
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,650
wanted to do today is give you a little

1128
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,400
bit of an introduction into red teaming

1129
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,680
clarifying a couple of things that I

1130
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,260
found myself facing along the way namely

1131
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,460
people not really understanding the

1132
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,420
difference between pen test and red team

1133
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,860
engagement and also we're gonna focus a

1134
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,680
lot on on the examples of what those

1135
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,960
difference translate into in other words

1136
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,800
there are a couple of things that you

1137
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,210
might do in a pen test that you might

1138
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,000
not do on a red team engagement and vice

1139
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,670
versa ideally after this talk you'll be

1140
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:02,460
able to identify some of the differences

1141
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,650
so like I said what we'll cover quick

1142
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,120
intro comparison with penetration

1143
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,310
testing and then we're gonna dig dive

1144
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:13,890
into examples in particular we're going

1145
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,470
to talk about IP n domain reputation

1146
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,690
when developing a spear phishing

1147
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,720
campaign for your red team engagement

1148
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,650
and if you were on my last talk we gave

1149
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,930
an introduction about mini cats this

1150
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,300
time I'm going to continue a little bit

1151
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,270
of that talk focusing on bypass

1152
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,840
techniques

1153
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,090
that you might need in order to move

1154
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,690
around in an environment that is heavily

1155
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:43,770
protected compared to maybe just rather

1156
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,430
simple network and later on we'll by the

1157
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,560
end I'm going to give you some extra

1158
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,900
resources you're going to see a bunch of

1159
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,690
links throughout the presentation but

1160
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,730
I'm going to provide a few extra ones at

1161
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,010
the end along with a couple of books

1162
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:03,140
that I feel summarized very well

1163
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,890
everything that you need to know to

1164
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:08,280
understand that the red team the red

1165
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,120
team engagement or red teaming compared

1166
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,180
to other types of offensive engagements

1167
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:21,960
so for our quick intro I wanted to make

1168
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,030
a little bit of a difference it's very

1169
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,560
common for people to talk about a red

1170
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,020
team when they actually refer to the

1171
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,270
ethical hackers penetration testers and

1172
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,210
basically everyone on the offensive side

1173
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,690
of cybersecurity which is slightly

1174
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,330
different than the engagement itself

1175
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,700
which is not really called red teaming

1176
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,770
or red team engagement the difference

1177
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,240
honestly it's a lot about this

1178
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,920
simplicity and speed efficiency as you

1179
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,370
can see and on the right we're going to

1180
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,960
talk about creating domains we're going

1181
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,610
to talk about doing a lot of stuff but

1182
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,470
it's not uncommon for a pen test which

1183
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:04,140
is request to be white listed to

1184
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,840
generate exceptions because pen test a

1185
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,760
lot of times you're dealing with clients

1186
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,550
who want to do a lot of things within

1187
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:14,520
just one week so maybe you won't be able

1188
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,400
to create a lot of domains give them

1189
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,350
time to gain reputation and all of that

1190
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:21,210
a lot of times you'll just ask hey can

1191
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,840
we be white listed in order to be quick

1192
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,990
efficient and to the point versus where

1193
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,480
if you are on a red team engagement

1194
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,700
you're probably going to want something

1195
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,740
that is low comprehensive and well

1196
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,070
simulated in regards to how a real

1197
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:42,240
attacker would perform it now having

1198
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,640
said that one is not necessarily better

1199
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,380
than the other like I said you might be

1200
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,849
dealing with a client that doesn't

1201
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:51,269
have the amount of money to invest for

1202
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:53,119
an engagement that is longer than a week

1203
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,809
even worse maybe you were dealing with

1204
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:59,279
client that recently started caring

1205
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:02,069
about cybersecurity a red teaming a full

1206
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,539
red team engagement it's not going to

1207
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:06,720
give them anything useful versus just a

1208
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,779
really quick vulnerability assessment or

1209
01:03:08,779 --> 01:03:15,960
well targeted pen test so let's talk

1210
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,229
about a particular example for that and

1211
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:21,119
if let's say that you're preparing a

1212
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,989
spear phishing campaign if you are doing

1213
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:26,940
so but we said before for a pen test

1214
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,160
maybe just ask to get why listed send

1215
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,229
the emails say who clicks and then you

1216
01:03:31,229 --> 01:03:34,200
have a valuable metric to provide to the

1217
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,670
client hey this is the amount of people

1218
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:39,329
within your firm that click but for a

1219
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:42,839
red team engagement that he can spend

1220
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:46,109
even months you might need to take

1221
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:47,880
certain steps because you want to fully

1222
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,229
simulate what an attacker would do so

1223
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:54,150
one of the common things that I've seen

1224
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,190
and actually a couple of people don't

1225
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,359
know you can use services to curry your

1226
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:03,269
spear phishing campaigns but normally

1227
01:04:03,269 --> 01:04:05,999
what they do is just they add a tag or a

1228
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:08,849
header like within the email header that

1229
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:12,690
is gonna say eggs fish test now I

1230
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,190
mentioned that for two reasons I've

1231
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,349
heard of people who didn't actually know

1232
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:19,229
that that was there again for repentance

1233
01:04:19,229 --> 01:04:21,989
that's great it might actually help you

1234
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:24,539
to get whitelisted and get through with

1235
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:27,559
the test but for in a real case scenario

1236
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:30,210
that shouldn't be in there so you're

1237
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,559
probably gonna end up doing a lot of

1238
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:35,749
custom things instead of just using a

1239
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:39,329
pen test sorry a spear fishing service

1240
01:04:39,329 --> 01:04:43,650
let's say no before or fishing box or

1241
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,599
that kind you're probably going to end

1242
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,390
up doing your own thing not only in the

1243
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,829
email sending itself but everything

1244
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:55,559
related to it that is getting a domain

1245
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,529
and making sure that they have

1246
01:04:58,529 --> 01:05:00,539
everything that's necessary so it's not

1247
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:01,770
going to look like spam but

1248
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,460
rather like a legitimate domain having

1249
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:11,130
SPF DKIM all of those elements and if

1250
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,410
it's pointing to a website in which you

1251
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,720
want to serve malware in order to infect

1252
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,760
the target one of the things you need to

1253
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,130
consider is there might be crawlers

1254
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,080
there might be scrapers that are going

1255
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,610
around on the internet and if they see

1256
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:25,320
your website with malware they're gonna

1257
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,120
flag it they're going to blog list it or

1258
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,360
something similar so in order to solve

1259
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,210
that and increase impact

1260
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:35,660
you're gonna dedicate some time into

1261
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,210
making sure that what you serve to who's

1262
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,190
connecting to you it's gonna be

1263
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:42,570
different depending on whether it's a

1264
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,820
crawler if it's actually one of your

1265
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,570
targets and also try not to use

1266
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,890
off-the-shelf exploits but rather

1267
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,690
develop your own and we're gonna talk

1268
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:56,760
about that in a bit so in particular for

1269
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,070
IP reputation then we're going to talk

1270
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,170
about the remaining reputation one of

1271
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,810
the things that I noted avoid free VPNs

1272
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:06,750
like the plague they're all already flat

1273
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:11,190
in fact you can get paid services with

1274
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,410
several different servers all over the

1275
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,150
world and they're already gonna be

1276
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,050
flagged and on a vast majority of them

1277
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:22,320
I've had good results with peer private

1278
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,940
Internet access they don't have as many

1279
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,340
but sometimes they're Flags sometimes

1280
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:30,480
they're not nor the VM for example it

1281
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,480
has thousands and almost all of them are

1282
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,450
already flagged so ideally what you want

1283
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,670
to do is just create your own way of

1284
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,460
sending those emails but if you feel

1285
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,720
like that's too much work you can

1286
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,180
actually use a high reputation sender

1287
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,480
like mail chickens or SendGrid

1288
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,510
I've heard good things about mail 250

1289
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,220
and swag mail but personally I haven't

1290
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,280
tried them but I had sex with both mail

1291
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,260
chip and SendGrid regarding their domain

1292
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,470
reputation the age of them may be

1293
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:07,830
something that is important and that's

1294
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:10,020
one of the reasons why for example it's

1295
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,790
not really feasible for a pentose if

1296
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:14,190
it's just going to last a week you won't

1297
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,670
be able to actually increase

1298
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,040
that age in any meaningful way it will

1299
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,190
always be from the moment that you sign

1300
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,319
the engagement letter you might say okay

1301
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,089
we're done I'm going to start with this

1302
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:26,470
right away and I'm doing the pencils

1303
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,599
next week it's still gonna be just a

1304
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:32,799
two-week old domain for a red team

1305
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,319
engagement you probably will be able to

1306
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:37,750
buy the domain very early on then

1307
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,819
continue with other parts of the open

1308
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:42,010
source intelligence social engineering

1309
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,869
intelligence gathering whatever else

1310
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:45,930
you're doing prior to that attack and

1311
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:48,400
you'll have enough time that the domain

1312
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,329
will at least be a month old or

1313
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:53,710
something like that so it doesn't look

1314
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:56,740
like fresh new that was just created for

1315
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:00,849
this in particular SSL certificates from

1316
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:02,230
a certificate of authority

1317
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:06,549
instead of self signed certificate and

1318
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:12,270
setting up Demark dkim and SPF which

1319
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:14,890
basically if you know what those are if

1320
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,420
you don't know what those are

1321
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,179
it's basically telling the server that

1322
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:21,460
receives the email Chris allowed to send

1323
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,589
emails on your behalf

1324
01:08:23,589 --> 01:08:27,540
like in terms of server a signature and

1325
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:30,219
just a bunch of rules on on what to do

1326
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:34,238
and how to read those verifications if

1327
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,179
you will and going back a little bit to

1328
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,819
MailChimp and MailChimp and SendGrid

1329
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:42,339
if you're setting all of the all of this

1330
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:43,899
on your own make sure that you also

1331
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:46,089
verify your domain with these providers

1332
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:49,060
so that when you send that email it says

1333
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,850
that it was sent by you instead of a was

1334
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,399
sent by mail chip on behalf of your

1335
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:01,210
domain in order to continue with domain

1336
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:05,679
reputation we mentioned trying not to

1337
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,439
get flagged getting blacklisted and

1338
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,689
serving different content according to

1339
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:13,569
who's connecting there's different ways

1340
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:16,899
to do that but the most common one is

1341
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,448
use this with the user agent now you

1342
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:22,359
should know that you could connect to a

1343
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,279
website with whatever user agent you

1344
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:27,219
want so you could have a scraper

1345
01:09:27,219 --> 01:09:29,029
connecting to your

1346
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:32,988
server and naughty identifying itself as

1347
01:09:32,988 --> 01:09:35,118
a crawler as a scraper or something like

1348
01:09:35,118 --> 01:09:37,819
that but probably is gonna use the user

1349
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,589
agent of Chrome or something like that

1350
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:41,899
one of the common techniques to try to

1351
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,259
detect that is using javascript which

1352
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:47,988
basically means setting up a script

1353
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:50,328
making sure that whoever is connecting

1354
01:09:50,328 --> 01:09:53,569
to your server will ran that script and

1355
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:55,789
that's great we'll do a couple of checks

1356
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:57,320
within the environment in order to

1357
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,929
determine yeah this guy is a bot or this

1358
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,719
guy is a legitimate user I'm gonna

1359
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,889
change what I'm serving to this user and

1360
01:10:05,889 --> 01:10:10,400
if you just want to see a bunch of user

1361
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,039
agents for different crawlers right

1362
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:15,230
there you can use that command it will

1363
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:18,650
download from grey noise whatever update

1364
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:21,650
at least they have of web crawlers under

1365
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,800
user agents just slap that into your

1366
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,239
server make sure that you don't give

1367
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,699
them anything suspicious add the

1368
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:30,920
JavaScript try to analyst a little bit

1369
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,789
more and then you serve different

1370
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:37,420
content according to this different

1371
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:41,840
clients that we'll be connecting some

1372
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,110
final recommendations or considerations

1373
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,360
they email volume this is kind of

1374
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,360
obvious but if the email is huge there's

1375
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,480
a lot of HTML code in it and you're

1376
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,000
sending emails like crazy you're still

1377
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,300
gonna get flagged ideally you need to

1378
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:02,389
try to keep it precise try to send a

1379
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:04,309
couple of emails then wait a little bit

1380
01:11:04,309 --> 01:11:05,960
and send a couple of emails so maybe

1381
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,969
short bursts with decent pauses in

1382
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:12,739
between will go a long way avoid broken

1383
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:17,840
links and try to avoid rhetoric I have

1384
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,820
seen some services or security solution

1385
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:26,449
flagging rhetorics when the domain that

1386
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,880
you your domain is redirecting let's say

1387
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,679
to Google Facebook something like that

1388
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:32,989
to a high reputation domain but you are

1389
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:37,070
not related to them so this is normally

1390
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:39,530
used when let's say you're trying to

1391
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:43,130
capture credentials and then

1392
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:46,460
forwarding that to another domain versus

1393
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,790
just grabbing and throwing doing a

1394
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:52,160
permanent redirect or that kind of stuff

1395
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,490
you gotta be careful with those details

1396
01:11:55,490 --> 01:12:00,230
in order to to make the campaign not

1397
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:04,850
only realistic in terms of how the

1398
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:07,880
attacker would do it but also try not to

1399
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,740
alert a bunch of security tools in the

1400
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,950
meantime doing like funky stuff so try

1401
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,180
to keep it simple

1402
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:22,160
while emulating all of that now let's

1403
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,420
move into the longer portion of the of a

1404
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,790
presentation as I said on the last

1405
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,310
presentation I was talking about mini

1406
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:34,220
cats which is a great tool you can use

1407
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,640
it to get credentials from a device and

1408
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,590
then reuse those credentials however you

1409
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:44,270
deem necessary but that I mentioned at

1410
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,540
the end of that talk was that because

1411
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,120
it's such a powerful tool a lot of

1412
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,790
anti-malware solutions are looking for

1413
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:53,120
it

1414
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,190
so ideally you will have to find a way

1415
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:58,690
to hide it so we're gonna talk about

1416
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:03,440
obfuscation encoding packing you know

1417
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,640
that there's a bunch of tools that

1418
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,220
probably people are very aware about but

1419
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,290
I wanted to mention a couple of new ones

1420
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,810
ie particularly interested powerline you

1421
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:16,760
were great and then we're gonna move on

1422
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,320
to up waitlisting bypass there's a nifty

1423
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,330
technique in which use our garbage

1424
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:26,120
collector and a path traversal in order

1425
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,060
to run other stuff while being

1426
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,940
whitelisted then we're going to talk

1427
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,030
about a msi which is the anti-malware

1428
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:37,840
scan interface for Windows and

1429
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,250
credential guard which is pretty

1430
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:40,900
self-explanatory

1431
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,280
trying to prevent stuff like mini card

1432
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,520
still in credentials and last but not

1433
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,230
least we're going to talk about kernel

1434
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:50,780
drivers because why not if you're

1435
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,240
already in the inter device itself

1436
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,880
why staying user space when you can move

1437
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,330
to Kern

1438
01:13:56,330 --> 01:14:00,920
kingdom so let's start with operation

1439
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,100
encoding and packing personally I'm

1440
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,970
surprised that you can use X or encoding

1441
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,950
Shikata and I from the Metasploit

1442
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,380
framework or even just keyword

1443
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,650
replacement and in some cases that will

1444
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:22,250
still work so not so long ago in 2016

1445
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,750
the guys from Black Hill InfoSec

1446
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,370
basically grabbed me me cats throw it

1447
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,330
into virustotal

1448
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:32,600
and already without doing anything only

1449
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,140
nineteen out of the fifty something and

1450
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,890
Jesus actually found or identified many

1451
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,770
cats as a threat and one of the very

1452
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,000
first thing that they did is just

1453
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,030
replace the word cats with dogs and that

1454
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:51,080
number that the nineteen positive

1455
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,470
antibiotic identifications for malware

1456
01:14:53,470 --> 01:15:00,380
dropped to only aid so now a quick

1457
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,860
mention on that I've seen that still

1458
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:07,700
work but it's a huge different on where

1459
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,830
it is working it says a lot about the

1460
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:12,260
maturity of a company their stance on

1461
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,690
cybersecurity whether you can bypass

1462
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:18,140
with rather simple and well-known and

1463
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,300
documented techniques that have been out

1464
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,380
there for years

1465
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:26,120
or if you need to kick it up a notch and

1466
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,280
try to make things a little bit more

1467
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,790
complicated like we're about you see

1468
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:34,930
normally that usually correlates to

1469
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:38,630
compliance so if you have banks dealing

1470
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:40,280
with credit cards they have to comply

1471
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,920
with PCI if you have hospitals with

1472
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,130
patient health information they have to

1473
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:49,280
comply with HIPAA versus let's say you

1474
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,590
have a really successful startup that

1475
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,570
doesn't really deal with our credit card

1476
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:56,480
information or patient information but

1477
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,910
there still have a lot of personally

1478
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:01,250
identifiable information yet there's

1479
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,250
very little regulations that relate to

1480
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,830
them directly so those are the kind of

1481
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,440
companies that you're gonna see maybe

1482
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,140
don't have really

1483
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,660
advanced security may be all techniques

1484
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:16,230
like this one will work but at least

1485
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:19,050
other bigger more mature companies are

1486
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:21,300
picking up on this and trying to find

1487
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:26,070
solutions for it so that's why I moved

1488
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:28,470
onward to more complex techniques and

1489
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:31,040
one of the things that I found recently

1490
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,520
it was honestly super simple it's and I

1491
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,560
love the title of the of the article

1492
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,670
that will bring your own garbage

1493
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:40,590
collector so basically you bypass

1494
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:43,680
application whitelisting with a net core

1495
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,350
open-source software framework and a

1496
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,260
very simple path traversal I'll let you

1497
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,680
over there the link that you can see in

1498
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,140
a rather simple way how you can use this

1499
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,340
to run other stuff while having your app

1500
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,700
let's say whitelisted but personally I

1501
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,730
love powerline a lot more because as you

1502
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,350
can see there you can run PowerShell

1503
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:09,390
without using PowerShell it's actually

1504
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:12,630
c-sharp and one of the great things

1505
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,270
about it is as I mentioned a little bit

1506
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:19,380
ago so you can use different packing

1507
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,660
encoding and obfuscation mat methods

1508
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,490
that have been out for a while like she

1509
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:25,320
Kerrigan I within the Metasploit

1510
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,780
framework but this one is a fairly new

1511
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,240
one that i catched not so long ago and

1512
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,300
I've had nothing but success with it in

1513
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:41,700
particular I tested it for a client so I

1514
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,230
couldn't actually take screenshots so

1515
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:47,190
the screenshots are for from the source

1516
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,950
that you see down there running it

1517
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,560
stand-alone is gonna get caught whether

1518
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,570
it is downloaded to a file in training

1519
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,490
to run or even trying it to run a memory

1520
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:59,340
is gonna get caught but if you drop in

1521
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,400
with empower line all of this elements

1522
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,740
you can actually put many cuts inside

1523
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,190
drop header and soles and even if

1524
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,260
they're blocking PowerShell this is

1525
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,610
still gonna work because like I said

1526
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,080
it's not actually running PowerShell

1527
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,710
it's c-sharp but they implemented pretty

1528
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:19,140
much the same calls very similar methods

1529
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,810
so it's a great way of hiding your

1530
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:25,449
payloads without getting caught

1531
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:30,590
by any of the very simple security

1532
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:32,780
solutions that you might have even some

1533
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,210
number a complex one have been able to

1534
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,500
bypass just using power line

1535
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:43,420
as for the anti-malware scan and

1536
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:47,110
credential guard that are present on

1537
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:52,639
Windows they're a bunch of bypass

1538
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:56,300
techniques so but they still keep going

1539
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,630
back to hey I'm gonna grab the keywords

1540
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:02,929
from the script throw it into Windows

1541
01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:04,820
Defender and make sure that if Windows

1542
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:07,100
Defender says this script it's gonna

1543
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,239
block it well one guy just XOR the whole

1544
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:14,360
script for bypassing a MSI and that's it

1545
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,650
it was no longer detected if your user

1546
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,420
the user that you are attacking is an

1547
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,790
admin there's pretty much nothing to

1548
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:23,300
worry about

1549
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,250
you'll be able to just move forward if

1550
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,590
they are not an admin well I left you a

1551
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,750
link of a bunch of different AMS I

1552
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,330
bypass that actually do work with

1553
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:36,710
PowerShell so using that and power line

1554
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:38,929
will basically allow you to bypass a

1555
01:19:38,929 --> 01:19:47,060
bunch of different detection methods but

1556
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,880
personally one of the most powerful

1557
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,880
tools that I've seen is mini cards on

1558
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,270
its own already has a kernel driver

1559
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:00,070
which is called mini Drive or mini DRV

1560
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:02,630
this allows you to move from user space

1561
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,790
to kernel space which gives you more

1562
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,860
windows functionalities you can modify

1563
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,510
running processes under attributes and

1564
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:13,940
you are now able to interact directly

1565
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,969
with other loaded drivers instead of

1566
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:19,790
having to use something in between to

1567
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:23,119
start it super easy exclamation point

1568
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,239
plus sign and as you can see on the

1569
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,580
screenshot it's going to look for it is

1570
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,530
it's gonna see if it's pressed and it's

1571
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,179
gonna see if it's registered it's gonna

1572
01:20:32,179 --> 01:20:35,750
give permission to everyone and that's

1573
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,969
it now do remember

1574
01:20:37,969 --> 01:20:39,949
to clean it up afterwards we're talking

1575
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:41,979
about a kernel driver that is gonna be

1576
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:46,239
added there it should go without saying

1577
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:49,280
during your engagement you should always

1578
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,840
do proper cleanup at the end which is

1579
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,219
again one of the reasons why you are

1580
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:56,630
gonna see a little bit of a difference

1581
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,119
between a pen test and a Red Team

1582
01:20:59,119 --> 01:20:59,840
engagement

1583
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,239
you're probably gonna spend a lot of

1584
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:06,170
time catering and and nurturing your

1585
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:08,510
exploit to make it something beautiful

1586
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,729
super complex that is gonna grab a bunch

1587
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:13,400
of different things well it probably has

1588
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,729
the potential to either generate a lot

1589
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:19,670
of destruction or simply leaving a bunch

1590
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:22,820
of open holes that your dool definitely

1591
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:25,989
need to close so going back to this

1592
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:29,719
whatever these techniques that you're

1593
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:32,360
looking at and trying to implement try

1594
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,829
to go through the source code try to

1595
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:36,440
understand what they are actually doing

1596
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,949
how they're doing it and how you'll

1597
01:21:39,949 --> 01:21:43,309
manage to revert anything that they open

1598
01:21:43,309 --> 01:21:46,420
up or modify

1599
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,580
so more references and sources one of

1600
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:59,160
the things that I wanted to leave at the

1601
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,370
top of the list there's a really small

1602
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,200
book called red team development and

1603
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,110
operations it comes with a companion

1604
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,640
website you can actually go to the

1605
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,610
website right now there's already a

1606
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:13,160
bunch of information there

1607
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,330
personally I prefer something to ring

1608
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,460
for having like a small book to carry

1609
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,230
around and be able to read every once in

1610
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:22,770
a while that one and the next one which

1611
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,220
is tribe of Packers red team that one is

1612
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,890
basically just a collection of

1613
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:31,410
interviews with 47 professionals in the

1614
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:34,190
field but they talk a lot about

1615
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,810
understanding the difference between red

1616
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,990
team and pentesting there's an

1617
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,090
incredible amount of recommendations

1618
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,630
regarding rules of engagement how to

1619
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:49,590
properly deal with all of those all of

1620
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:54,090
those elements we saw I so little ago in

1621
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:55,620
the chat when they was talking that

1622
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,630
people were asking hey what happens if

1623
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:02,580
you get caught well very important to

1624
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:07,260
have a signed letter a sign engagement

1625
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:12,300
letter in order to like Matt said that's

1626
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,600
your get-out-of-jail-free card I've

1627
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,890
actually one of the things that I've

1628
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:18,600
done is actually create a fake one and a

1629
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,400
real one and try to present the fake one

1630
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,010
first and if that one goes through then

1631
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:24,870
I have yet another thing to mention on

1632
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:28,560
the report that failed but yeah

1633
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,500
definitely having all of this organized

1634
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,530
you know a good way it's going to help

1635
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,890
you a lot and those two books going to

1636
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:39,660
great detail on how to go about doing

1637
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:43,800
that and there's there's a bunch of

1638
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,940
github lengths in which I normally take

1639
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:50,130
ideas they're sharing like different

1640
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,080
techniques sometimes they recommend

1641
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,230
tools a lot of the information that

1642
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,060
you're going to need is going to be just

1643
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:00,840
there in terms of tactics techniques and

1644
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,820
procedures there's a whole line of

1645
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,889
first the github links has awesome red

1646
01:24:07,889 --> 01:24:10,050
teaming so you can look for awesome

1647
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:11,250
thread intelligence

1648
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,079
awesome blue teaming there's a bunch of

1649
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:15,329
there's like a whole mini series of of

1650
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:17,849
these guys collecting a bunch of

1651
01:24:17,849 --> 01:24:21,619
information condensed into one of the

1652
01:24:21,619 --> 01:24:25,139
areas of cybersecurity be it offensive

1653
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:28,460
side defensive side or just research

1654
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:31,349
there's a lot of information to be taken

1655
01:24:31,349 --> 01:24:33,690
from that one but I did leave a couple

1656
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:36,920
of others that I think have really good

1657
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,040
analysis and certain tools or

1658
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,750
recommending like I said tactics

1659
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:48,869
techniques and procedures and all in all

1660
01:24:48,869 --> 01:24:52,170
a bunch of techniques and tools that you

1661
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,060
can download tailor to your own effects

1662
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,119
and then launch them however you deem

1663
01:24:57,119 --> 01:24:59,389
necessary

1664
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:09,969
I'm gonna wrap it up because I know that

1665
01:25:09,969 --> 01:25:13,380
we don't have that much time left so

1666
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,540
when I demonstrate into Q&A and

1667
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:20,190

in there you have a question on um not

1682
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:07,869
really I mean red team is kind of part

1683
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:09,849
of what I do it's not like covering

1684
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:11,859
something of a difference uh somebody's

1685
01:26:11,859 --> 01:26:14,979
got I'm actually familiar with okay you

1686
01:26:14,979 --> 01:26:16,989
know I found it interesting that you

1687
01:26:16,989 --> 01:26:19,389
said that you all make a fake engagement

1688
01:26:19,389 --> 01:26:22,539
letter fake get out of G I got out of

1689
01:26:22,539 --> 01:26:24,909
jail free card um I didn't think about

1690
01:26:24,909 --> 01:26:30,669
that that's interesting yeah sorry for

1691
01:26:30,669 --> 01:26:32,709
interrupting my advice would be careful

1692
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,209
with social engineering and some

1693
01:26:34,209 --> 01:26:35,649
thinking hearing a lot of course my

1694
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:38,739
officer cuz that could get you a whole

1695
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:43,780
another level of trouble oh stop talking

1696
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:48,399
about that I've had both of those

1697
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:50,739
experiences actually happened to me in

1698
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,929
one case I was caught by the security

1699
01:26:52,929 --> 01:26:55,119
guard that's when I used the fake

1700
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,949
engagement letter because the security

1701
01:26:56,949 --> 01:26:59,709
guard was employed by my clients or was

1702
01:26:59,709 --> 01:27:02,409
within the scope law enforcement unless

1703
01:27:02,409 --> 01:27:05,349
you're getting hired directly informed

1704
01:27:05,349 --> 01:27:08,099
he's never on your scope and you always

1705
01:27:08,099 --> 01:27:11,229
had to be completely honest with them do

1706
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:13,030
not ever try to give them the fake

1707
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,739
engagement letter go straight with a

1708
01:27:14,739 --> 01:27:17,439
real one yeah that's definitely I've had

1709
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:21,929
both both situations happen to me and I

1710
01:27:21,929 --> 01:27:24,879
think I saw in one of the comments I

1711
01:27:24,879 --> 01:27:27,579
don't know if it was due David I mention

1712
01:27:27,579 --> 01:27:30,399
it that guards tend to be trigger-happy

1713
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:32,409
if there are in my case they weren't

1714
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:35,379
armed but yeah they were a lot more

1715
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:37,629
aggressive than when the police came up

1716
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:41,320
like actually the police were I would

1717
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,389
say they were like fascinated about what

1718
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:45,489
I was doing they would they were happy

1719
01:27:45,489 --> 01:27:48,849
to get my engagement letter call the

1720
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:51,369
client number that was in there verify

1721
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,039
the information they were great it was

1722
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:56,109
actually the bad experience that I had

1723
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:58,790
was actually with the security guards

1724
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:02,100
the Walmart would have been so posture

1725
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,620
is it honestly again I'm a former

1726
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,090
military police officer and I've had

1727
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:08,940
worked with LAPD in San Diego PD if I

1728
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,250
rolled up on a scene and I was suddenly

1729
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,470
given two different letters I was

1730
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,880
seriously called a question the validity

1731
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,520
of the actual correct letter in your

1732
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,780
name oh yeah I get what you're saying

1733
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,340
yeah that's definitely something to

1734
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,700
consider in my case those two scenarios

1735
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,940
occurred in different situations so yeah

1736
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,370
I didn't have to deal with the security

1737
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:34,260
guard telling one thing to the officer

1738
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,900
and me telling him another that likely

1739
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,270
didn't happen and and I get what you're

1740
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:43,830
saying that could and giving more issues

1741
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:45,600
than actually solution so it's

1742
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,260
definitely something to consider but

1743
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,900
that being said there's also a lot of or

1744
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,630
stupid security guards that just don't

1745
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,190
even know what they're doing

1746
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,020
I actually remember one time I was doing

1747
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:01,140
a red teaming demonstration for a telco

1748
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,240
company I was working for and I actually

1749
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,130
had the security guard help me carry a

1750
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:13,590
computer all the way out to my car kind

1751
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:16,290
of scenarios but my only two bad

1752
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,850
experiences were the ones that I just

1753
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,460
mentioned everything else must be great

1754
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,150
I know that in the both in the comments

1755
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,740
and in the previous questions they were

1756
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,720
talking for example about using a high

1757
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,660
visibility vest and a hard hat yeah it's

1758
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,080
amazing how much just that is gonna help

1759
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,630
you get across it or get access to

1760
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,970
somewhere you're not supposed to be or

1761
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:41,520
even better just people avoiding

1762
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,560
bothering you because they think okay

1763
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,270
he's busy he's doing something important

1764
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:47,790
I'm not gonna bother him so all of that

1765
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:51,180
is within the field of possibilities

1766
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,540
when using just a high visibility vest

1767
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:58,530
and a hard hat I also make sure if your

1768
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:00,060
only other things I used to make sure I

1769
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:03,870
did was if I used a an ID card of some

1770
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:05,850
kind they had picture on it I always

1771
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,230
made sure the picture was a little bit

1772
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:08,460
ambiguous something a little bit

1773
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,020
different about me made it harder to

1774
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,480
actually tell who I was

1775
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,910
and make sure I didn't carry an actual

1776
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,010
real correct ID because some places I've

1777
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,230
gone to when I did a test I was like you

1778
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,090
show them the your corporate edge and

1779
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,170
then they ask you for your driver's

1780
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:22,400
license instead so they can make a

1781
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,590
photocopy like you're like uh and the

1782
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:27,320
names don't match so I'd say something

1783
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,150
like I left it on the car I'll be right

1784
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:29,570
back

1785
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:36,500
and then those badge makers they can be

1786
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,050
a little bit pricey I mean that you

1787
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,270
guess what I've seen online you can find

1788
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,160
it for like the lowest I've seen is

1789
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,650
probably around $700 so that they can be

1790
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,510
a little bit expensive but are they

1791
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:50,870
worth it oh yeah even staples and Office

1792
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,700
Depot they actually if you go online you

1793
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,480
can actually find them online they make

1794
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:59,150
bubble jet ID card makers and it's just

1795
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:02,120
the plastic with a laminate that you run

1796
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,680
through your bubble jet printer puts the

1797
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,120
fake ID on there and then you like a

1798
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,440
piece of tape you put it on top of the

1799
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:10,450
plastic looks like a regular ID card

1800
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:13,460
yeah I'd rather stick to the overnight

1801
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:14,930
so I don't have any interaction with

1802
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:20,560
people it's just a lot easier understood

1803
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,810
so I have a question for Henry so are

1804
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:28,330
you ready the whole red teaming and also

1805
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:30,440
physical as well you think they're

1806
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,090
increasing a lot more with having

1807
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:36,700
everybody working robot or not so

1808
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,630
actually I would say two things about

1809
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:43,600
that lately work has been crazy and I

1810
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,590
feel like one of the reasons is because

1811
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,510
precisely because everybody's working

1812
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:51,110
remotely but all of that like you said

1813
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,570
all of that is really focused on online

1814
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:57,260
interactions rather than physical pen

1815
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,500
testing I I don't know if that was a

1816
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,110
preference of my clients I was actually

1817
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:04,790
doing physical pencils for a couple of

1818
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:07,100
them and they said hey because of the

1819
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,560
whole coronavirus thing we're basically

1820
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,260
closing up the office everything

1821
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:14,180
everyone's working remotely and I said

1822
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:17,989
okay I understand that while you're

1823
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:19,790
doing that makes perfect sense but

1824
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:22,150
you're asking me now to go to tests

1825
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:24,950
physically now that there's a lot less

1826
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:25,250
peep

1827
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,800
that can catch me but yeah that's the

1828
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,710
way they prefer to do it and personally

1829
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:34,670
I think that it's it's a mixed bag

1830
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:38,210
it will definitely depend on on on that

1831
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:39,890
particular building and the way it is

1832
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:44,150
set up because on one end like I said

1833
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:46,190
there's little less people that will be

1834
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:48,410
able to see me if I'm doing something

1835
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:50,990
funky but at the same time they're

1836
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:53,210
probably few security guards that are

1837
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,370
gonna be present are expecting to see

1838
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,530
absolutely no one so at the same time

1839
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,990
you might actually be hard I guess it

1840
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:01,820
all depends on on the building itself

1841
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:04,220
how it is set up how security set up and

1842
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:07,760
those kind of things a problems they

1843
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,200
have right now with everybody working

1844
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,060
from home also isn't it now you are

1845
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:13,130
opening yourself up to a plethora of

1846
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:15,110
potential attack vectors because if one

1847
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:17,780
of your employees has an exposed or

1848
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:19,160
compromised computer on their home

1849
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,170
network and they suddenly connect their

1850
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:22,730
home network to their work network via

1851
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,610
VPN I can see a lot of bad [ __ ]

1852
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:26,840
happening in the very near future with

1853
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:34,910
stuff like this well yeah that's in a

1854
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:37,190
way privilege escalation because now

1855
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:38,960
since let's say you have a whole company

1856
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,030
working from home so instead of

1857
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:43,070
attacking the low-level privileged

1858
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:44,990
employees you can just go directly and

1859
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,210
try to hack into the CEO of the company

1860
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:48,710
who would say which is actually working

1861
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,330
for home it just started at the CEO of

1862
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:51,800
the company it's going to have full

1863
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,500
access to the whole company so instead

1864
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,940
of packing all the other employees just

1865
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:59,050
go directly to the to the to the CEO

1866
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,260
sure

1867
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,960
did anybody else see the the deep fake

1868
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,460
hack that was showed up in the news

1869
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:08,120
fairly recently a company basically got

1870
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:11,000
deep fake hacked not by a picture but by

1871
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,550
voice they had managed to replicate the

1872
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:17,050
CEOs voice and contacted the CFO

1873
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:19,940
authorizing the paper to go to some bank

1874
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,770
account and they ended up getting a

1875
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,600
substantial amount of money before they

1876
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,860
ever really realized that it was a deep

1877
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,099
fate

1878
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:42,180
oh I saw a question from flyers in the

1879
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:45,930
chat so what happens when you trick say

1880
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,210
the receptionist's and some higher up

1881
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:50,070
realizes that you're not Sophie supposed

1882
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:51,840
to be there how do you recover from that

1883
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,450
or that's it you just leave at that

1884
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:57,720
point it could be either you could end

1885
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,050
up leaving one of the reasons why we

1886
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:02,640
were talking about high disability-based

1887
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:06,570
hard hats and pen and paper everything

1888
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,820
along those lines with the clipboard and

1889
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:11,850
everything else one of the cool things

1890
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,920
about using stuff like that is that

1891
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,350
neither their reception is not the sea

1892
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:18,210
levels are gonna understand what you're

1893
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,340
trying to do and probably both are gonna

1894
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,320
try to leave you alone the receptionist

1895
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,510
is gonna let you go into the back room

1896
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,580
and then the higher arts at most they're

1897
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,580
gonna complain that the Internet is slow

1898
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,320
and they want you to fix it and that's

1899
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:31,650
it

1900
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:35,040
at least that's what happened to me one

1901
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,200
time in which I was interrupted in the

1902
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,440
middle of the server room like with my

1903
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,690
disability bills and everything else and

1904
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:44,310
it was literally just two complained on

1905
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:46,260
the internet was low and if there's

1906
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,820
anything that I could do about it and

1907
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:53,190
that was it certain cases if it's not a

1908
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:55,350
sea level but it's actually within the

1909
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:57,300
IT team and knows that you're not

1910
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,700
supposed to be there yeah you can

1911
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,640
probably tell you've done like saying

1912
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,710
well probably I'm in the wrong room let

1913
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:05,520
me figure it out

1914
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:28,010
just calmly but surely get out yep oh

1915
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,740
what's the most complicated step you've

1916
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:35,310
taken in order to implicate a company

1917
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:36,750
for example my case I think one of the

1918
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:40,310
things that I went like above beyond was

1919
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:42,570
so I had this company I had to hack into

1920
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,000
and they had an outsourced IT company I

1921
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,610
went through the trouble of doing Olson

1922
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,210
on the

1923
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:49,860
see company and actually print out a

1924
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,020
shirt and badge for that company in

1925
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,570
order to hack them how far have you gone

1926
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:57,180
in order to get into building any war

1927
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:03,600
story sure I do have one that already

1928
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,280
was done and I'm actually preparing

1929
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,219
another one in which I'll be going to

1930
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:11,070
the data center of a bank and I'll be

1931
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:12,690
trying to hack directly into the data

1932
01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:14,580
center instead of the bank because the

1933
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,080
security at the bank is crazy the

1934
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,270
security of the data center is lags

1935
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:21,150
which is kind of weird because it's

1936
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:23,430
usually the other way around like you

1937
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:27,810
have super high security on the data

1938
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:30,660
center and not so much and on the HQ of

1939
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,540
the bank in this case I have it the

1940
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,980
other way around so I'll be coming to

1941
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:40,200
the data center with a fake badge and a

1942
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:44,160
couple of other things but in the past

1943
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,590
probably the one that I had to do the

1944
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:48,660
most for a single engagement there's two

1945
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,219
things that I did that one of them I

1946
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:52,260
love and as soon as I'm able to do it

1947
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:56,460
again I will which is in your talk you

1948
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,610
mentioned about Dropbox basically a

1949
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:01,680
Raspberry Pi with Kali and everything

1950
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,430
else with annuals in a minute

1951
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:10,980
what and you also mention a drone so one

1952
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,719
time what I did is hook up the drum

1953
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,760
books to the drone just connect the

1954
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,310
server that allowed me to drop the

1955
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:20,610
payload and just took the drone flew to

1956
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:23,219
the roof left it there took the drone

1957
01:38:23,219 --> 01:38:26,280
back and I had a Dropbox on the roof

1958
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,880
with internet access but knowing that

1959
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,020
nothing was gonna happen to it because

1960
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,510
he was like in in a really densely

1961
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:36,690
populated area there was all concrete no

1962
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:38,719
way of it's a big building and

1963
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,950
everything is concrete on the outside

1964
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,590
there's no weight of leaving that hidden

1965
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:48,120
somewhere so I touch it to the drone fly

1966
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,670
to the roof leave it there fly back and

1967
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:55,110
then I was able to hack remotely mention

1968
01:38:55,110 --> 01:39:00,360
about that I used a battery pack with a

1969
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,979
solar panel

1970
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:07,110
attempting to get the most out of it for

1971
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:09,630
the longest time and that was kind of a

1972
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,550
bad idea because the constant sunlight

1973
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:15,630
ended up not bursting but you know like

1974
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:18,539
right before NEPA battery explodes it

1975
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:24,269
basically inflates a lot oh yeah it was

1976
01:39:24,269 --> 01:39:28,079
I was when I went to pick it up back

1977
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:31,590
with the drone flew over there catch it

1978
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:33,510
fly back and then when I'm unpacking

1979
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:36,059
everything I realized like this is about

1980
01:39:36,059 --> 01:39:39,929
to explode so I'm definitely gonna try

1981
01:39:39,929 --> 01:39:41,849
that the whole drone and dropping it on

1982
01:39:41,849 --> 01:39:43,920
the roof again but this time I'm

1983
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,479
probably gonna find some shade or

1984
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,909
something because I I almost lost the

1985
01:39:47,909 --> 01:39:51,840
entire drop box and even worse I could

1986
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:57,380
have started a fire No thank you for me

1987
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:02,249
luckily for me the Box it was in was

1988
01:40:02,249 --> 01:40:03,300
fireproof ie

1989
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,239
I was thinking about exactly that so I

1990
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,209
put it in a fireproof box so I at least

1991
01:40:09,209 --> 01:40:11,280
I want to believe that even in the worst

1992
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,170
case scenario nothing bad would have

1993
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:21,510
happened and I also once ended up going

1994
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:26,940
into construction building so I had I

1995
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:30,090
had the luck that the same company that

1996
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:33,809
hired me was basically remodeling the

1997
01:40:33,809 --> 01:40:35,190
building right next to them both

1998
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:38,159
belonging to them both projects hired by

1999
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:42,869
them so I asked if he was okay here and

2000
01:40:42,869 --> 01:40:44,639
he was a similar situation like wife I

2001
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,280
always way high up too much interference

2002
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:52,260
I even cooking up a yagi antenna didn't

2003
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:54,059
actually give me like a reliable

2004
01:40:54,059 --> 01:40:56,849
connection to it because the office even

2005
01:40:56,849 --> 01:40:58,739
though one of the buildings was there's

2006
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:00,139
the new building that they were building

2007
01:41:00,139 --> 01:41:03,570
the previous one they were renting so

2008
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:06,829
the office was like the top floor and

2009
01:41:06,829 --> 01:41:09,269
this was before I came up with a drone

2010
01:41:09,269 --> 01:41:12,719
idea so in that time I actually went

2011
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,110
into a construction building

2012
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:19,960
similar attire that I use for other

2013
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,060
engagement here's a high-visibility best

2014
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:24,700
stuff like that went up I actually had

2015
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:29,880
to buy a harness because they required

2016
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,410
the the guys in the construction to wear

2017
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:34,330
a harness because it was a high-rise

2018
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:37,270
building so I actually got myself a

2019
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:37,750
harness

2020
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:41,140
I already which is probably something

2021
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,720
important to mention I had already

2022
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,430
worked in construction

2023
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:48,190
I actually was allowed because this

2024
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:49,630
didn't happen in the US this happened

2025
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,640
back home and you need a special

2026
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,650
credential for that luckily for me

2027
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,330
already had that credential so I was

2028
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:57,310
allowed to operate heavy machinery I was

2029
01:41:57,310 --> 01:42:00,250
allowed to climb on a construction

2030
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,650
building so that made it a lot easier

2031
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:05,770
I'm said well after working construction

2032
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,810
I moved into hacking I still had those

2033
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:09,370
credentials so I said might as well use

2034
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:13,090
them so I got into the construction site

2035
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:17,350
much like any other worker there with a

2036
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:19,750
bunch of small devices much like the

2037
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,870
ones you showed Wi-Fi don't go Raspberry

2038
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:25,170
Pi stuff like that hidden in a bunch of

2039
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:29,590
different pockets or on the vest just

2040
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:32,290
went to the highest floor installed the

2041
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:34,810
Raspberry Pi over there and went back

2042
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:38,710
out and that was probably yeah that was

2043
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:45,030
as far as I gone to to target a firm

2044
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:47,590
pretty cool so I actually had the idea

2045
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:50,530
using the solar panel I'm actually I

2046
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,900
recently got one so I'm in the process

2047
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,890
of testing and uh with the battery

2048
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:59,170
testing the input output see how how

2049
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,900
long it lasts and why not but also keep

2050
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,580
in mind the temporary one I don't want

2051
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:08,020
to blow up the battery yeah definitely

2052
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,340
in my case one of the things that

2053
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,990
probably would have helped is also

2054
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:13,960
adding cooling like active cooling to

2055
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,610
the whole box instead of just a really

2056
01:43:15,610 --> 01:43:17,530
small fun on the Raspberry Pi and that's

2057
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:22,810
it also the quality I got like a really

2058
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:26,650
cheap solar solar panel battery pack

2059
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,930
maybe getting a good quality one with

2060
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:29,769
will

2061
01:43:29,769 --> 01:43:34,840
avoid those issues gonna give it a try

2062
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:40,920
if anything all that you know awesome

2063
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:44,380
hey we got a spark what are the

2064
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:46,059
requirements are you can you not do any

2065
01:43:46,059 --> 01:43:49,510
module board besides no no no all you

2066
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,639
need is it's pretty much just the deep

2067
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:53,920
the BG spark and actually didn't we

2068
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,309
record the talk that you did Daniel for

2069
01:43:57,309 --> 01:44:02,349
the Arduino yes I did the pretty on the

2070
01:44:02,349 --> 01:44:05,769
Arduinos and the digi spark let me see

2071
01:44:05,769 --> 01:44:08,469
if I can dig it up and I'd be happy to

2072
01:44:08,469 --> 01:44:10,389
share it with you guys if you like or it

2073
01:44:10,389 --> 01:44:11,679
actually may already be on the YouTube

2074
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,280
channel I'll go take a look you do not

2075
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,979
you do not need the physical Arduino you

2076
01:44:17,979 --> 01:44:21,090
need the Arduino IDE

2077
01:44:21,869 --> 01:44:29,050
to answer your question Elias little USB

2078
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,079
device you can get them I've seen them

2079
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:36,039
cheap as I $2 and even even even cheaper

2080
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:37,119
than that you can get it for like a

2081
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:39,630
dollar if you buy them in bulk through

2082
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:45,130
what I remember you said you gotta throw

2083
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:45,670
ababa

2084
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:49,269
um I bought some from I think I got a

2085
01:44:49,269 --> 01:44:52,659
batch from eBay and they were all bad I

2086
01:44:52,659 --> 01:44:57,369
got like two batches of five right so

2087
01:44:57,369 --> 01:44:59,289
one batch of five all five of those were

2088
01:44:59,289 --> 01:44:59,920
bad

2089
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,349
they were 2 bucks apiece and then the

2090
01:45:02,349 --> 01:45:03,939
other back of five all five of those

2091
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:07,030
were good so tenorman back that i got i

2092
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:09,610
think it would say 30 or 40 devices I

2093
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:11,349
guess I would say give you my way all

2094
01:45:11,349 --> 01:45:12,760
over the place I mean they they're super

2095
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,650
cheap yeah and you said you'd gotten

2096
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:16,329
those from hollyball and I'm like oh man

2097
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:23,199
I should have done that you know and the

2098
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:25,389
puggy says he saw three for 10 on Amazon

2099
01:45:25,389 --> 01:45:31,630
that's not bad but yeah yeah so do you

2100
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:32,800
guys know what the shippings like from

2101
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,619
Alabama these days is it I mean it was

2102
01:45:35,619 --> 01:45:38,320
slow before but it has the Cova thing

2103
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:42,189
made it impossible yeah he made it a lot

2104
01:45:42,189 --> 01:45:43,510
worse used to be

2105
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:46,920
less than 20 days and right now I'm at

2106
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:50,800
almost 40 days waiting for something

2107
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,280
that I purchased through Alibaba so yeah

2108
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,909
it looks bad

2109
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,960
let's vary shipping anything from

2110
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,610
overseas the United States that kind of

2111
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:09,280
slow right now that latest raspberry-pi

2112
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,860
for that I ordered it has 8 gigs of RAM

2113
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:13,960
that's been in transit now for a little

2114
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:14,650
over a month

2115
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:20,349
hmm Wow I'm also oh I know what I puts

2116
01:46:20,349 --> 01:46:22,510
good um not so much a question for you

2117
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:25,179
Henry but I was going to offer it up

2118
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:28,269
I also did a talk on setting up the SPF

2119
01:46:28,269 --> 01:46:31,570
D command D mark records a little bit

2120
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:34,329
stuff on your DNS and getting the domain

2121
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:38,650
and the all of that set up so if anybody

2122
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:41,710
wants a copy of that I don't think I

2123
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:44,320
recorded it but I have a slide deck and

2124
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,449
I would be happy to do a session on that

2125
01:46:46,449 --> 01:46:50,650
if you guys like we got the rest of the

2126
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:56,650
years don't we yeah yeah that's another

2127
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:58,630
thing we actually we need prezis guys

2128
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:01,269
any talk any presentation session that

2129
01:47:01,269 --> 01:47:06,130
you want to do offer yourself up like I

2130
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:07,539
was mentioning in chat I was actually

2131
01:47:07,539 --> 01:47:08,980
thinking about anybody who would

2132
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:10,809
consider the concept of doing maybe a

2133
01:47:10,809 --> 01:47:12,670
blue team talk I'm like wouldn't mind

2134
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:13,900
hopping or something like that

2135
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,760
so we don't do these red team talks but

2136
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,769
maybe we should also show some kind of

2137
01:47:17,769 --> 01:47:20,500
defensive or as Mac footed purple team

2138
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:25,079
talk teams be the new big thing yeah

2139

01:49:21,399 --> 01:49:22,449
not gonna happen

2171
01:49:22,449 --> 01:49:25,780
is it gonna be good cool I did announce

2172
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:27,519
it at the beginning a little bit but it

2173
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:28,780
is gonna be virtual it's gonna be

2174
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:32,949
October 3rd I believe and I can slap a

2175
01:49:32,949 --> 01:49:35,499
link in here we have a mailer that's

2176
01:49:35,499 --> 01:49:37,780
going out soon the CTF is gonna be

2177
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,489
virtual it's gonna be popped up on the

2178
01:49:39,489 --> 01:49:41,709
server and we'll probably put it on CTF

2179
01:49:41,709 --> 01:49:43,479
time in a couple other places you're

2180
01:49:43,479 --> 01:49:44,979
shaking your head no why are you shaking

2181
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:48,340
your head no okay no there's another

2182
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:51,969
person on camera oh okay um the UH the

2183
01:49:51,969 --> 01:49:54,570
chili cook-off portion on the other hand

2184
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:58,349
seems to be problematic virtual but

2185
01:49:58,349 --> 01:50:03,179
we'll make some good suggestions on that

2186
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:07,700
oh thanks for posting the discord and by

2187
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,500
I totally I knew there was something I

2188
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,150
forgot to do and it was the discord

2189
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:15,290
whines sorry we guys we the idea is

2190
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:18,860
eventually you move to discord the slack

2191
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:21,230
is alright but they they caught us off

2192
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:25,610
on messages and features so I'm just

2193
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:28,250
waiting for the disco to be migrated

2194
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,050
over and then we'll have it as a backup

2195
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:32,890
basically

2196
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:41,850
cool stuff so the only issue I had with

2197
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:44,520
the online version of doing any of the

2198
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:47,130
CTS is at the last seat the winter

2199
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:50,730
hackfest that we had I was on we were

2200
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:52,680
dominating up until like the last hour

2201
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,690
when I don't know who was showed up and

2202
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:57,540
he had like 3040 people online in remote

2203
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:59,520
locations that just there was no

2204
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,410
competition I mean I had four people at

2205
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:03,540
my table this guy had a crack ton of

2206
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:06,630
people on his team oh wow you know Ron

2207
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:08,760
you talked about that that's what you

2208
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:11,910
were talking about like when was it the

2209
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:14,340
black hat CTF that was I was doing

2210
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:17,550
DEFCON one time we were playing open CTF

2211
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:20,370
and Baggett's and there was a team that

2212
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:22,590
had a basically they were pointing a

2213
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:25,160
wireless antenna into one of the the

2214
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:28,170
Riviera hotels and they had like 3040

2215
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,580
people playing for them they were just

2216
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,740
sitting and drinking beer and then you

2217
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,180
were looking at the score war and they

2218
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:34,860
were going up up up up and we were like

2219
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:37,020
pulling our hair so that's the problem

2220
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,410
when you do on lyse e DX they you can

2221
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:43,440
avoid e you know people bringing their

2222
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,250
friends you know it's SS that's hard

2223
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:50,730
so a limit on the number of teammates

2224
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:56,880
you have it would be kind of difficult I

2225
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,100
agree especially if they're like they

2226
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,380
just sign up and have 12 teams but

2227
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:02,790
they're all really helping out for one

2228
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:05,910
team that would kind of suck but it's

2229
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:07,050
difficult I understand where you're

2230
01:52:07,050 --> 01:52:08,580
coming from with that just that's why I

2231
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:10,380
like the physical which I understand is

2232
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:12,300
not as cost effective anymore

2233
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:16,110
nevertheless it's just still gonna be

2234
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:19,980
cash prizes good nails as far as I know

2235
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:25,500
yes we have our vendor sponsor packages

2236
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,810
put together and almost ready to send

2237
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:29,280
out so if there's anybody on the call

2238
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,100
that wants to be a vendor sponsor I hit

2239
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:34,230
me up for that and we definitely need

2240
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:37,230
vendors so we'll get a little creative

2241
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:40,759
with that and yeah

2242
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:46,800
what I have for you today stay safe and

2243
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,080
we'll see how this goes

2244
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,210
