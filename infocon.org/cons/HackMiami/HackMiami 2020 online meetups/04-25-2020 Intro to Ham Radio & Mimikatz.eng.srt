1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,710

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,120
Henry or Sam was gonna go first you

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,129
wanna do the shorter presentation first

4
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,099
or the longer Sam I think you're up

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:14,549

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,420
ready all right so everybody Sam is the

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,800
an awesome guy and he knows a lot about

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,160
a lot of stuff so looking forward for it

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,700
free stalk and take your waiter put this

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,370
slides because people now ask about the

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,270
slides in the chat channel so I'm

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,289
sharing a show you see the presentation

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,609
now yep looks like GoToMeeting picked up

15
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,579
on it all right

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,960
Samuel Greenfeld I'm Steven CISSP

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,079
certified for ten years recently one for

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,589
the software variant specialize and sell

19
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,189
for quality assurance especially on this

20
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:10,619
security sides blackhat scholarship

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,990
recipients what their last year as a

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,200
result also have done many of the

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,180
conference recordings for hack Miami

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,490
that you see on the YouTube as well as

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,380
recorded the first year of specific

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,079
hackers conference and the reason I'm

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,390
giving this talk is I'm a licensed

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,240
amateur radio operator for the past 30

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,130
years see sure I'm on the right screen

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,970
with the cursor so the agenda what does

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,890
that matter radio what can you do what

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,000
you cannot do

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
operating practice how to get your

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,500
license in the conclusion I guess I was

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,570
hoping to do this in person so he'd show

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,299
off toys unfortunately we're not at the

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,119
library so we cannot really go off into

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,719
showing twice today so the top service

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,979
what is that mature radio technically is

40
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,350
defined radio communication service with

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,070
purpose to self training if occasionally

42
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,450
carried out by amateurs that is

43
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,640
duly authorized versus interested in

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,069
rich Serino techniques le foot with a

45
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,380
person like me without a canary or

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,440
really a financial interest its

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,480
regulated by the Federal Communications

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,000
Commission United States and it's I

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,709
would say it's not really a single hobby

50
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,480
it's a range of possibilities that said

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,069
the reason it's a it's a lot like using

52
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,770
a car I mean you can just drive around

53
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,989
the car casually to where you need to go

54
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,750
you may want to build a car from scratch

55
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,630
you can do that amateur radio you may

56
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,370
want to pimp out your car and make it

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,910
all fancy and or you may want to do try

58
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,860
to race it or something and those are

59
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,209
all sorts of things you can do with

60
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,590
amateur radio as well again you can do

61
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,470
conversation locally around states to

62
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,480
the world it's a concept of directed

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,510
nets where one operator controls the

64
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,760
flow of traffic and who should talk when

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,980
these are difficult done to exchange

66
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,950
message traffic we also use it to manage

67
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,440
an event such as a marathon or incident

68
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,320
such as a hurricane its concept of D

69
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,970
expeditions where people are actually

70
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,549
going traveling internationally to

71
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,040
locations to run amateur radio usually

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,850
they choose a nice-lookin location in

73
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,489
the rear which is rarely causing me to

74
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,350
have very many amateur radio operators

75
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,250
to be you can said you can contest there

76
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,930
people try to work all stage four

77
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,350
continents work fifty hundred countries

78
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,109
who can make most contacts in it a

79
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,280
certain amount of time maybe bogus

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,900
multipliers for using certain techniques

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,900
and stuff field day is your general

82
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,730
merging a practice emergency whatever

83
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,010
run which is done every year truly just

84
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,829
crowds of the bands it's your fourth

85
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,750
weekend in June presume thing that still

86
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,359
happens there's lots of local events you

87
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,269
might be able to see someone doing stuff

88
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,470
alternatively there's where field day

89
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,399
which is done in January but it's not

90
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,160
done by the same organization and you've

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
concept of sending or I'm qsl or

92
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,470
response cards saying little

93
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,310
postcards say

94
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,190
I talked to this person or nowadays why

95
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,810
our equipment is the logbook of the

96
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,860
world which is an online system and you

97
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,270
can experiment with amateur radio

98
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,400
different operating modes different

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,320
designs internet lengths so though

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,780
that's pretty common nowadays so not

101
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,000
really as experimental may want to try

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
how far can you go in low powers are

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,490
very commonly done satellites or earth

104
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,860
moon earth bouncing has also done a bit

105
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,930
and I just gave an example of FG agents

106
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,790
weak signal communications here they're

107
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,130
repurposing a protocol used actually to

108
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,479
talk to deep-space probes and and it's

109
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,520
basically a very automated communication

110
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,590
that can be done to transfer things back

111
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,888
and forth

112
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,419
volunteer emergency services are also

113
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,870
done you may just doofus it volunteer

114
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,240
for like a marathon or rock or run or

115
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,090
other event you have to cost Aires which

116
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,759
is every emergency service it's warmer

117
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,069
private-sector things more official ease

118
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,889
you have raised these which is gringo

119
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,930
amateur civil emergency service which is

120
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,849
explicitly defined in the rules that

121
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,460
define amateur radio the practice these

122
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,889
are usually the same groups often have

123
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,419
other groups out there you have

124
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,580
hurricane watch groups Saturn there's a

125
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,889
Salvation all army so why are purple

126
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,699
patrol military amateur radio service to

127
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,319
treatment tropics might be needed to

128
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,810
maybe health and welfare there's all

129
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,610
there may be a lot of site traffic which

130
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,409
may just be people trying to confirm

131
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,330
that people are still alive or people

132
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,819
passing along messages confirming

133
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,979
someone stole alive one thing I will

134
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,750
note especially since September 11th

135
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,699
these groups often require explicit

136
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,830
training registration and background

137
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,229
checks all done before the emergency

138
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,379
actually happens if you're doing

139
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,360
anything that involves the government

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,830
chances are you going to need to take

141
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,150
FEMA's incident command service ICS

142
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,340
courses I like one hundred two hundred

143
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,840
and seven hundred this is not this is a

144
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,460
federal requirement this is not

145
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,340
something can easily be bypassed some

146
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,210
groups also like for amateur radio 800 a

147
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,969
are out like they are on come level one

148
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,039
for areas groups and if you're working

149
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,529
with the Red Cross or something they may

150
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,210
also want you to have their

151
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,550
certifications as well so now we've gone

152
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,779
through what's allowed and what's not

153
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,180
allowed generally having a financial

154
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,090
interest in the conversation public

155
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,219
broadcast music foul language commercial

156
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,620
all that legal usage encryption

157
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,150
you can't encrypt things on amateur

158
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,520
radio sadly you can do like iMessage

159
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,250
hash though using more than the Midland

160
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,590
power required generally also is frowned

161
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,740
upon that said is that these are

162
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,509
generally speaking there are kinds of

163
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,690
exclusions like if for example you had

164
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,219
an agreement with NASA to rebroadcast

165
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,669
the audio from a space station

166
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,409
well and they happen to play music to

167
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,539
wake up the astronauts well that's okay

168
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,990
or if you were you to schedule time to

169
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,729
talk to the space station with your

170
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,830
class and you were the teacher and you

171
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,029
were being paid to be their teacher

172
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,379
that's also okay too

173
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,199
and there's a said there's a some gray

174
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,389
areas with this one talk is offering how

175
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,039
much of the process of can you order of

176
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,539
a pizza over amateur radio and the

177
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,289
interpretations of that actually have

178
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,219
varied a bit over time here's just a

179
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:01,340
picture of some of my stuff I just put

180
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,740
together the Kenwood little radio in the

181
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,629
middle here let's see this is turning

182
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:10,189
along a little pointer this little radio

183
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,620
here is 20 years old it still works it's

184
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,319
just an am/fm mobile ring I just decided

185
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,469
to show mobile rigs here because I know

186
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:20,930
you see a lot of you carrying around

187
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,610
Bell phones so these are a bit more

188
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,650
powerful that's oh that's just an FM ray

189
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,620
dual-band typically dual BAM you mean 2

190
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,860
meter 440 ring on top here we have an

191
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,260
ancient also 20 years old roughly

192
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,110
speaking packet radio set extends dated

193
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,979
about 1200 baud and down below here I

194
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,890
have a modern radio which is the Cieza

195
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,709
thing here that comes with a that one

196
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,660
has a USB that has a built-in sound card

197
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,449
that is upgradeable firmware that has

198
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,980
all your modern fixings

199
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,040
so radio like that nowadays

200
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,190
it also does hf b hf so it covers a lot

201
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,980
more bands it can do a lot o MF animal

202
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,209
digital modes a lot more on its own

203
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,649
Lorraine you like that if you've got it

204
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,339
pre-made that's only it that one's about

205
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,230
$1,200 or the modern equivalent to

206
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,750
something like this probably is 300 400

207
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,360
for the middle for the mobile ring and

208
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
that one probably nowadays would include

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,100
bluetooth and conclude include the

210
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,839
digital radio that's sitting on top of

211
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,510
it it could include GPS and a whole

212
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,940
bunch of other things so where you have

213
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,779
evolved in general so

214
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,530
I'll get him into operating practice

215
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,660
because I know we don't have so much

216
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,990
time Kurt there are currently three

217
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,240
classes of licenses you can get for

218
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,830
amateur radio you start out as the

219
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,520
technician I'll go up to the general and

220
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,070
now you the amateur extra or extra class

221
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,010
a licensing is cumulative you have to

222
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,720
pass the lower exams to get the higher

223
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,620
license some also some discontinued

224
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,330
license classes but there's still people

225
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,940
licensed under them such as the novice

226
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,680
the technician plus a maid advanced

227
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,830
class these at all Point had their own

228
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,900
fury exams but main difference you could

229
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,270
say is they required more various

230
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,040
different levels of Morse code knowledge

231
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,500
than deal current ones did ever since

232
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,800
the early 2000s Morse code is no longer

233
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
required one thing I will note because

234
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,420
some people are paranoid here is license

235
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,970
records are public information they no

236
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,560
longer include information like your

237
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,470
date of birth but the basic record that

238
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,300
you have an amateur radio license and

239
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,550
your address will be public along with

240
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,770
your call sign that said you do not need

241
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,870
a license to receive amateur radio this

242
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,530
is primarily a license to transmit

243
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,910
technical enable license historically

244
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,670
would be also argued to be a a license

245
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,620
to be the control operator of an amateur

246
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,140
radio stations as well as the license to

247
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,480
have an amateur radio station but that's

248
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,360
all most technical distinction here's

249
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,440
the little bit of math as as not to get

250
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,870
only math they want a pointing chair is

251
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,130
that you have the concept of a

252
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,560
wavelength is equal the speed of light

253
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,470
divided by the frequency so basically

254
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,770
well I'm going to why is the Miss giving

255
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,270
is an example here why is the amateur

256
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,540
radio band here between 144 and one for

257
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,110
a roughly 150 megahertz known as 2

258
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,820
meters it's because if you divide 300 by

259
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,430
150 you get 2 and the reason that

260
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,080
matters is was when you're treating an

261
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,740
antenna

262
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,480
they're often cut to fractions or

263
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,040
multiples of the base wavelength and and

264
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
if necessary I mean I can pass placed a

265
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,850
link to this here

266
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,149
just a band short and I'm also I just

267
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,269
pointed out it's just pointer on a

268
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,000
blazer so care about various amateur

269
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,470
radio bands you can see they break it

270
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,759
down by what license class can do what

271
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,889
where in terms of frequency this reason

272
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,060
I'm also kind of mentioning this is you

273
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,800
can see that there are a lot of bands

274
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,930
they vary in frequency the bandwidth

275
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,449
they said again three meters in

276
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,500
frequency and you can see the name but

277
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,300
they notice how big some of these bands

278
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,750
are and it's they're not very big if you

279
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,250
think about it because if you look

280
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,370
historically I want to just compare it

281
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,589
to Wi-Fi for a second here because if

282
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:39,970
you know you're two gigahertz Wi-Fi

283
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,630
bands you have three independent 20

284
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,120
megahertz channels most of these bands

285
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,060
here are not 20 megahertz light at all I

286
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,399
mean two meters is only four megahertz

287
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,949
wide you go down to 30 meters at slight

288
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:59,709
point zero five megahertz wide so we're

289
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:02,199
talking a lot less than with then you

290
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,939
have with your Wi-Fi especially once you

291
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:09,939
get to five Hertz Wi-Fi you got two

292
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:10,509
meters

293
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:13,269
you got your 40 megahertz channels which

294
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,970
are now 80 and now what's with Wi-Fi six

295
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,360
one 60 megahertz channels and while you

296
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,149
can do that at higher frequencies you

297
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,100
don't necessarily have access to that at

298
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,000
lower frequencies and most for most of

299
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,350
the amateur radio bands which are in

300
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,740
common use you're all sharing less batt

301
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,480
much less bandwidth in your typical

302
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,209
Wi-Fi connection but that doesn't mean

303
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,860
you can't do voice and stuff it just

304
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,680
moves that the radios use a lot of more

305
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,740
historical techniques for audio for

306
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,800
example with you know your basic here

307
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,509
you got what would you call a just

308
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,089
borrowing from Wikipedia this video you

309
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,180
have this baseband signal which is

310
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,370
basically used speaking that gets

311
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,050
shifted up in frequency Jen you're

312
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,670
talking over here I mean if you

313
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,700
but if you're a young you make am signal

314
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,220
historically had a copy and another copy

315
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,740
over here just of it of you speaking

316
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,650
along with this carrier share which if

317
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,150
you were just doing CW all you really

318
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,740
need is this carrier which is very

319
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,650
little bandwidth but if you're smart

320
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,380
what you can do is you can just we'd

321
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,970
only have to really transmit this state

322
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,460
si you know you can don't need to

323
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,440
transmit this large carrier which means

324
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,820
you can also increase the power of this

325
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,710
and use regardless of what you're using

326
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,990
like very little bandwidth same

327
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,550
alternatively you could just transmit

328
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,980
this bottom piece here and you still are

329
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,170
getting here a point across and that's

330
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,230
basically how it's done with the various

331
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,640
at least at the lower frequencies as you

332
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,320
just aren't very conservative of how you

333
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,200
use bandwidth it complicates the radios

334
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,950
a bit but it makes them it's much more

335
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,610
efficient use of the bandwidth so yeah

336
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,650
the high level basically the

337
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,020
international to automation using which

338
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,670
had defines the world into three regions

339
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,340
region to defines what the FCC can

340
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,400
allocate and the FCC then turns around

341
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,130
says given an amateur radio license of a

342
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,660
given class this is where you can

343
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,230
operate a more gradual levels there are

344
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,860
best practices recommendations that the

345
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,020
organization such as the ARL put out but

346
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,780
they are not necessarily where you were

347
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,860
required by law repeaters and beacons

348
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,410
should be coordinated if they're so

349
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,880
there are organizations that will try

350
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,980
and coordinate what frequencies used by

351
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,350
what for repeaters within the best

352
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,210
practice regions for where a repeater

353
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,180
should be located if you are coordinated

354
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,050
you are actually have have a bet you are

355
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,520
considered more important than someone

356
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
who do not get coordination should there

357
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,900
be a problem I said because lower

358
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,570
frequency bands have less data your loud

359
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,010
symbol rate varies by band however

360
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,230
modern coding is more inefficient but

361
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,270
they have to update the rules but still

362
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,190
you're not going to lower frequencies

363
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,200
you're not going to get Wi-Fi bandwidth

364
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,540
and

365
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,970
50 megabits a second just not

366
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,580
theoretically possible some allocations

367
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,650
are in the secondary basis amateur radio

368
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,810
shares their frequencies and others and

369
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,840
they make some Caucasians actually have

370
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,820
been lost like you may have noticed

371
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,890
there was a gap in a band on the

372
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,550
previous slide that was because ups at

373
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,320
one point thought about using that for

374
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,230
tracking packages eventually it did not

375
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,730
happen but the band section was lost

376
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,500
anyway these bands also very near

377
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,330
country borders as well if you travel

378
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,260
internationally so if you go close to

379
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,720
Canada there there may be frequent seas

380
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,850
which are used in Canada for different

381
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,770
purposes so if you get too close to the

382
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,020
border you can't use them for amateur

383
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,810
radio uh that said we have the concept

384
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,390
to call signs like and just like you

385
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,849
hear call signs for TVs whatever you

386
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:19,210
have call signs for you for amateur

387
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,550
radio operators just like radio station

388
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,710
also and everything else that said

389
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,390
amateur radio call signs all have a

390
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,000
number and typically refer to them in

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,060
like like one by two format would be one

392
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,160
letter a number than two more letters

393
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,430
after it with in Florida you're going to

394
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,860
have all half a call sign which begins

395
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,690
with four if you start out by getting

396
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,600
your callsign down here if you go if

397
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,890
you're in California or you're gonna

398
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,480
have your call signs always starting

399
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,250
with six it used to be decades ago that

400
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,290
if you traveled around the country and

401
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,300
moved you would have to change your

402
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,760
callsign to match the new region that is

403
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,830
no longer the case said they vary by

404
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,570
class by default they're issued

405
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,870
sequentially if the higher the class

406
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,870
license you get them longer you the

407
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,470
shorter of a call sign you qualify for

408
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,420
but they're no longer changed when you

409
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,830
moved around the US or change your

410
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,960
license class that used to be automatic

411
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,360
just gave some examples like there's

412
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,910
four blg Richland was a person I

413
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,720
actually worked under K 2 RF somehow k4f

414
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,160
a use at Florida Atlanta

415
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,190
University and they've had that since

416
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,710
1964 but more a more recent development

417
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,690
is if you don't like the callsign they

418
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,310
gave you automatically there are a

419
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,560
vanity call signs you can pay for just

420
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,260
like getting a vanity license plate so

421
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,800
you got there you for wdw is that Walt

422
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,740
Disney World if it ends in MOT it's

423
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,590
often a Motorola line W explore any

424
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,370
cheese the National Hurricane Center and

425
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,990
is an example here of an inheritance

426
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,570
10th floor BG the original person who

427
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,370
helped Bo G which is a club in the brown

428
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,300
can he died but since but because

429
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,000
there's an inheritance preference they

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,070
were able to retain the call-sign salsa

431
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,990
say the concept of clubs all signed

432
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,090
which are very much

433
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,010
a lot of the use of the Bandung eco

434
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,870
signs often if it's an individual game

435
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,430
event any call sign they just want

436
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,190
something shorter they used to be

437
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,170
concept of Gracie's call signs for those

438
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,820
emergency groups but they no longer

439
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,790
exist the race these groups have tried

440
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,530
to grab their old call signs back to his

441
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,230
club call signs if it's a super short

442
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,130
call sign it's typically a foreign

443
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,260
special event and you have to use your

444
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,930
callsign regularly during conversation

445
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,150
there are ID requirements I'm not going

446
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,900
to go too much into to the zoo stuff but

447
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,880
during this is hack Miami and possibly

448
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,290
Pacific characters we're going to get

449
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,840
things are the technical stuff in the

450
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
terms of the operating stuff I want to

451
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
get into the stuff really mostly that

452
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
you're not going to cover in the guides

453
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,990
obviously the power supplies you need to

454
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,300
have proper voltage connectors whatever

455
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,360
as you had obviously she also considers

456
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,030
surge currents because my big little

457
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,400
radio tip wants a 30 amp power supply

458
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,950
but even if you turn the power down all

459
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,470
the way on it it may accidentally blow

460
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,870
like me accidentally trip a smaller

461
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,730
power supply because the strum needs a

462
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,320
strong currents to start transmitting

463
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,460
even at a lower power my older radio

464
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,700
doesn't have that issue but getting back

465
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,280
to this slide you have Anderson power

466
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,910
poles

467
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,929
especially since

468
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,549
September 11th they've been looking to

469
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,639
standardize how everyone connects so you

470
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,590
can just borrow someone else's power

471
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,230
sources so Anderson power troubles are

472
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,730
your very common power bus so you have I

473
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,100
get here at the top picture of a power

474
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,710
supply with Anderson power poles there

475
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,539
my picture of this rig runner thing

476
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,960
which has power poles and connectors for

477
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,730
power poles genderless so you can take a

478
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,740
cable so this 50 jacket is the same as

479
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,519
the plug

480
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,299
you just plug right into each other

481
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,259
there are something now there are some

482
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:22,539
various sizes over connectors for power

483
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:27,639
poles but it turns out the 320 the 15 25

484
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,309
and 30 amp connectors all share the same

485
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,730
external power size so they vary on the

486
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,559
back as to what why are you connect to

487
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,990
but it gives you an easy way to create a

488
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,049
a power bus at 12 volts that everyone

489
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,090
else can connect to may also have

490
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,389
started seeing this kind of stuff these

491
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,369
kind of connectors appear another 12

492
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,049
volt supplies online Amazon and stuff

493
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,909
antennas I this could be a talking

494
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:57,610
itself can be be homemade they can be

495
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,759
achieved expensive as Purdue's operating

496
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,669
frequencies control their size may

497
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,740
require Brenton playing or something

498
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,820
traps techniques maybe and use band

499
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,289
they're gonna very obviously new a power

500
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,119
you can stand like this tiny little

501
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,149
antenna here they can stick on top the

502
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:18,249
car it's gonna take a lot less power and

503
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:21,070
stuff than this big one here then I can

504
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,799
just stick in a car when you're putting

505
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,679
an antenna out of car consider one load

506
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,549
one thing I will note if you have a

507
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,409
special antenna like this if you're

508
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,210
putting a car on top of antenna like be

509
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,159
sure to consider extra functionality you

510
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,960
like if you can fold it over like this

511
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,070
one can be folded over

512
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,999
connectors again very widely

513
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,490
that's amazing reversed estimators you

514
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,360
typically see on on higher frequency

515
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,950
devices that needs less power

516
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,369
cell phones are a prime example if using

517
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,850
reverse SMA well the radio you see

518
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,950
there's using a regular SMA connector

519
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,740
just means they swap which part is

520
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,360
supposed to have the male and female

521
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,419
parts a UHF connectors a historical

522
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,130
popular connector used at HF and VHF

523
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,890
frequencies when we're talking hf b hf

524
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,110
UHF there are some general ranges for

525
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,350
what frequencies are and those ranked

526
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,120
very high or ultra high or things like

527
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,480
that but there's some room to play BNC

528
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,850
connectors maybe on stuff in the 1990s

529
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,620
but I haven't seen them that popular now

530
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,770
and is more microwave and NMOS another

531
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,409
type of antenna mount you may find on

532
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:41,559
cars cables again cables obviously vary

533
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,250
in size and that the super tiny thing

534
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,190
obviously the I here which was so tiny I

535
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,960
don't know who didn't want to know how

536
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,750
much loss it has but then you get

537
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,850
thicker connectors like you think RJ a

538
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,710
NEX cable in the middle there and then

539
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,890
RG 8 you said twice the thickness so

540
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,169
that one meant that thicker one has

541
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:06,820
twice half the loss per foot bin the one

542
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,799
in the middle you have to consent when

543
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,090
you're making a cable one you have to

544
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,679
consider how loss of ADR at the

545
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,330
frequency you want to operate the map

546
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,730
also have an antenna over here made out

547
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,940
of LMR 400 which is a super ultra luffy

548
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,250
non a lossy cable which is about the

549
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,130
thickness of that one but even half half

550
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,880
that loss of that so the other thing is

551
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,820
cable quality varies widely you need to

552
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,890
be aware of that so you can get a cheap

553
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,059
chinese cable or something or maybe a

554
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,250
expensive cable and putting it on where

555
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,440
you get it and the quality of the cable

556
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,380
just because they call it RG aid x or 8u

557
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,929
a lot of these know historically had no

558
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,299
specs standards but a lot of companies

559
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,980
are not really making them to those

560
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,080
standards anymore so if you have a

561
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,409
poorly soldered on connector or

562
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,390
something you may have an issue where

563
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,220
your cable may be more lucky than it

564
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,490
otherwise could be it's also perfectly

565
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,289
possible for you to go out and buy your

566
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:10,539
own cable and then use that ground

567
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,269
ground planes be sure to properly ground

568
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:15,820
everything show me a single pass to

569
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,409
ground who do not want to ground loops

570
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:19,059
it's the same thing with water meal

571
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,449
electricity in your house do not want

572
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:24,669
you transmitting to be hot on some of

573
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,320
these have metal cases if there's a

574
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,059
floating ground you could have a risk of

575
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,609
RF burn or something if you touch the

576
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,269
case of your radio what was running and

577
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,889
since this is obviously Florida if

578
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:38,619
you're in concerning outdoor antennas

579
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:40,239
installation consider lightning

580
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:45,249
protection vehicle installations

581
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,229
depending on your regular said my big

582
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:48,729
guy does not like would not like a

583
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:50,589
cigarette lighter or Jack it's just that

584
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,859
I like cheddar Jack just only 10 15 amps

585
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,619
so even if I turn them all the way down

586
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,909
just starting I mean I might

587
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,849
accidentally blow the fuse so if you

588
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,949
have a radio like that you may need to

589
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:06,429
consider using the fuse box wiring

590
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,069
attack there I'm doing a direct wire to

591
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,009
the battery most cars in the US should

592
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,919
be negative ground it's possible that

593
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,469
it's positive ground and you have to

594
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:20,139
consider that if that happens newer cars

595
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,109
you miss aluminum ins steel why is this

596
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,329
important because if you touch two types

597
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,339
of metals together they start reacting

598
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:29,859
with each other and there's some risks

599
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,299
of one destroying the other it's like

600
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,849
the anode inside of your water heater

601
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:38,499
getting eaten slowly so you make if you

602
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,269
have a car that uses a mix of these you

603
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,649
may need to consider if you need to use

604
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:44,259
dielectric reads fast fasteners or

605
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:47,229
things like that one hooking up the

606
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,599
radio if you have to bypass the normal

607
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,619
fuse box or other circuits you also may

608
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:55,149
not be able to put a magnetic mount

609
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:58,359
easily on the aluminum surface also in

610
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,909
newer cars they often have a battery

611
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:02,169
monitor and the negative terminal

612
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,289
especially if they have an insta-star

613
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,849
system so they turn off the motor of

614
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:09,729
every start light if you bypass that

615
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,559
you're going to be drawing crewmen away

616
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,259
from the battery and battery money is

617
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,059
going to get very confused as to why the

618
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:17,919
battery seems to be in poor condition

619
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,139
than it is because it thinks it should

620
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,969
know how much currents going through the

621
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:23,030
battery and

622
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,890
you there's some current going through

623
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,160
the battery that it doesn't know about

624
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,260
if this happens usually these are in the

625
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,060
negative terminal you can use them

626
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,160
challenge to ground to the chassis set

627
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,680
the car if it's negative or otherwise

628
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,270
have to do it again

629
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,580
always fuse your power lines you just

630
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,950
I've even seen a negative line fused as

631
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,460
confusing as that is so you want to make

632
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,330
sure that there's no risk of if if

633
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,770
something happens you want to also fuse

634
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,630
as close as possible reasonably possible

635
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,340
to the battery so you don't accidentally

636
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,870
cause damage to the vehicle if you want

637
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,550
to do computer stuff there's plenty of

638
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,530
computer software whatever you want to

639
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,640
do many things are now controllable by

640
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,730
USB or serial ports sound modems are the

641
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,170
art of using the radios you're a

642
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,850
computer is a radio you may use an

643
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,890
isolated audio interfaces and get that

644
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,910
into the radio without risking having a

645
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,270
problem back just like you have TTC IEP

646
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,840
was derived from X 25 X 25 is a

647
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,120
renewable protocol which which amateur

648
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,250
radio and and it's Linux incidentally

649
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,470
has a kernel module for it so Linux on

650
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,410
its own can route X 25 just as natively

651
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,970
as it knows tcp/ip or ipv6 there was

652
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,820
there historically also his on an entire

653
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,070
eight subnet on the internet which is

654
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,560
just dedicated to amateur amateur radio

655
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,160
that said they realized that subnet in

656
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,410
today's day and age was a bit big and

657
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,710
there was this sale of roughly a quarter

658
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,620
of it to supposedly to believe Wikipedia

659
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,300
for Amazon for over fifty million

660
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,360
dollars so if you wanted not much an

661
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,500
ipv4 address is worth it's worth a lot

662
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,720
the actual details of that sale they'll

663
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,810
have been somewhat obscured but that's

664
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,210
what's believed to have happened if your

665
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,040
s is just logging is logging physicians

666
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,770
all sorts of web interfaces you may just

667
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,590
log log your contacts or software to do

668
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:36,890
that

669
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,680
if you want to send messages you can

670
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,910
just solve where'd you do that to a

671
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,500
concept that is covered in the course a

672
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,560
bit and it is it kind of standing wave

673
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,570
ratio which is ratio of your fuller to

674
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,200
your reflected power you want when

675
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,680
you're transmitting not all your if you

676
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,570
had a perfect message in China all your

677
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,730
power would go into the antenna should

678
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,220
be a 1:1 scenario which is ideal but in

679
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,170
practice you're not going to get that

680
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,860
there's always going to be some sort of

681
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,480
reflected power because antenna isn't

682
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,850
perfectly tuned or your cable isn't or a

683
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,580
connector in the middle has a tiny lower

684
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,880
fraction off of that on your radios can

685
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,530
tolerate this a bit if your your your

686
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,900
basic HF FM radio for higher frequencies

687
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,300
isn't necessarily going to let you play

688
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,100
with it

689
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,690
but at the lower frequencies you can

690
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,850
have an antenna tuner compensate for

691
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,160
minor errors ideally you don't want to

692
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,520
exceed 2:1 or 3:1 on this radio ratio

693
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,920
because you can damage is the antenna

694
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,560
here I have some examples of stuff of

695
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,930
two STR meters you also have a digital

696
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,260
meter one here just uses a single line

697
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,790
if I show you here this one just uses a

698
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,250
single line to measure SWR here's an

699
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,410
example of a dual fancy air of meter

700
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,210
it's just on one meter it's showing you

701
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,070
the forward power and the other leaders

702
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,960
shown you the reflected power and where

703
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,760
they intersect them these two lines

704
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,190
cross over here you can see where your

705
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,490
SWR lies if you're testing I do not

706
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,070
transmit in to your antenna you can test

707
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,350
your transmitter using a dummy load

708
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,170
which basically is a big resistor they

709
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,990
do not have to be very big I have a 300

710
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,910
watt daily load I'm just hold in my hand

711
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,060
here but if you're looking for something

712
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,540
which needs to handle a longer term we

713
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,890
need to transmit for an extended period

714
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,070
of time or a higher wattage you can get

715
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,590
an oilfield paint can basically these

716
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,290
are the size of paint cans and those are

717
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,060
dummy loads that you can transmit high

718
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,029
power on for an extremely long

719
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:56,509
period of time RF exposure limits by

720
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:59,989
government regulations on you you do

721
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:03,080
have to limit the RF exposures caused by

722
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,789
your station

723
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,830
that's say there are two sets of limits

724
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,259
it was involved with operating those

725
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,719
with the public it's up to operators to

726
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:14,830
prove that they're in compliance in

727
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,210
general it's and there are this is

728
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,679
probably the most calculating thing you

729
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,989
could possibly done do with your station

730
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:23,659
fortunately there are variety of people

731
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,700
put calculators on the web which can

732
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,099
help you try and do this there's also a

733
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:31,369
lot of things can come to consideration

734
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:34,899
that will help you such as the fact that

735
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:39,019
uh you don't have to worry about if

736
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,700
you're below certain power limit at

737
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,539
least at the moment and if there's also

738
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:47,210
factors that come into play such as

739
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,159
you're not transmitting all the time see

740
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,869
most of the time you're receiving and

741
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:54,700
also depending on what type of

742
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,690
transmission you're making you may also

743
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,619
get a little reducing factor as well but

744
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:02,629
however the FCC has looked to harmonize

745
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:04,639
these regulations across all of their

746
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,919
services so there will be generic

747
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,899
exemptions replacing the amateur radio

748
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:11,509
specific ones however I cannot tell you

749
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,309
what's going to happen with that because

750
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:14,719
that's still going to happen for the

751
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,879
next several months while they're

752
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,659
working on it if there's an emergency

753
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,969
anything you say is there any questions

754
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:26,349
because no one's said anything yet

755
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:36,710
good good emergency use anything goes if

756
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,269
there's an emergency but you have a bet

757
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,070
better to have a good reason for doing

758
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,879
it realize empty radios unencrypted this

759
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,769
does not mean that you talk to the nice

760
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:47,509
police dispatcher who asks you to

761
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,129
quietly get off their frequency

762
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:52,539
I have heard a story of that happening

763
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,739
outside of an emergency situation

764
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:57,049
someone casually transmitting the

765
00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:00,220
something when they should not be but

766
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,889
the FCC may alternatively limit amateur

767
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:05,259
radio operations as they see fit during

768
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:09,460
an emergency third party traffic

769
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,050
you can't let an unlicensed person

770
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,879
operate your supers your station if

771
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,440
you're supervising them your stall to

772
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,629
mately responsible you can relay a

773
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:18,579
message on behalf of someone else then

774
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,379
you received in the past so long as it

775
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,359
doesn't break any other rules that's it

776
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,819
if you're going internationally you do

777
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:26,379
have to have a third party operating

778
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,060
agreement to send traffic initially

779
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,530
there's also an additional

780
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,030
identification requirement you have to

781
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,440
identify at the end who you are talking

782
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,800
to this also gets a bit complicated with

783
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,168
Internet services because if you're

784
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:40,899
you're triggering a transmitter remotely

785
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:42,810
over the Internet into another country

786
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,219
then that kind of falls into their third

787
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,780
party rules and I've once watched

788
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,599
somebody using service called echo link

789
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,480
traced off of an international Mountain

790
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,280
remote they weren't allowed to remotely

791
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,040
do that internationally it's hard to say

792
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,750
without knowing the rules of the other

793
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,099
country if that was actually the case

794
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,240
alternatively you can go internationally

795
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,660
with amateur radio there's three I'd say

796
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,790
three main agreements for amateur radio

797
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,130
going internationally some of these

798
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,190
arguments are automatic some require you

799
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,290
to apply ahead at a time be sure to take

800
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,609
a copy of your license and the

801
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:20,950
appropriate paperwork

802
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,200
I mean FCC for one of the agreements if

803
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,940
she just gives you a three page print

804
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,560
out in three languages that you take

805
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,210
with you copy your licence and you're

806
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,760
good you go up to Canada you just bring

807
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,930
your license and you're certain

808
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,060
identifications and it works but there's

809
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,589
other cases where you have to formally

810
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:39,280
apply and the allowed frequencies will

811
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,130
be those under the treaty and allowed in

812
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,930
the visited country one thing I will

813
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,760
note is if some of these agreements were

814
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
written back in the age of Morse code so

815
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,050
if you don't know Morse code and can't

816
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,690
copy Morse code at set rate if they

817
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,369
haven't modified those agreements you

818
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,140
may actually be knocked down a class in

819
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,520
terms of what you're allowed to do

820
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,950
internationally harmonics images I'm

821
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,440
just bringing it basically you read your

822
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,480
body Ringo was in a simple crystal radio

823
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,030
then that works for AM C this is concept

824
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,040
of bringing down the frequency like you

825
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,030
sell from higher frequencies

826
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,430
lower frequency just like in here your

827
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,250
CPU may run in at 3 gigahertz but the

828
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,260
rest of your PC may only run at 400 or

829
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,480
800 megahertz because it's a lot easier

830
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,370
to take those frequencies further than

831
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,380
the 3 your heart's you just inside of

832
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,560
your CPU the downside to this this is

833
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,360
just an example I took from Wikipedia of

834
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,820
a heterodyne receiver superheterodyne

835
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,590
receiver which is a very common design

836
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,810
you can make multiple stages of this if

837
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,420
you get into the SDR talk next week they

838
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,310
just lost out where that demodulator is

839
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,770
and that's where your str starts hooking

840
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,720
in the problem with this is that uh when

841
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,920
you have a local oscillator you're

842
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,990
actually can receive two frequencies

843
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,820
it's one you're trying to receive and

844
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,450
then there's a other one you're not

845
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,310
trying to get there's also as I said

846
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,640
harmonics just like are just multiples

847
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,630
of your frequency so when you're

848
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,850
transmitting it like 20 megahertz

849
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,100
although you would never actually say

850
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,230
there's 25 - that's more closer to

851
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,450
amateur radio this you're also we have

852
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,340
multiples of that frequency it's going

853
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,990
to be technically transmitting at 50

854
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,730
you're going to be transmitting at 100

855
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,430
and also a half of 12.5 and stuff

856
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,230
but ideally you want to keep those two

857
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,240
minimum and your receivers also have

858
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,060
those kinds of risk sensitivities as

859
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,350
well this comes into place so when you

860
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,480
look up a radio spec you don't they'll

861
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,790
give you my image rejection and things

862
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,400
like that to tell you how sensitive the

863
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,260
receiver is and how much it can avoid

864
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,700
getting confused if there's an

865
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,590
additional signal there by this

866
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,880
especially comes into play with the

867
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,350
Chinese radios I know a lot of you guys

868
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,060
have been picking up on those Bao phones

869
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,810
I have one too and general amateur radio

870
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,330
operators are able to modify your other

871
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,850
radios for use in their bands and this

872
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,710
is generally not allowed for other

873
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,260
services malfunction similar in a great

874
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,380
area there was one FCC cease and desist

875
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,940
against a baffling employer cheap where

876
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,260
you guys are not necessarily as good

877
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,510
transmitters are selectively receiving

878
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,260
as expensive ones yes you can that's it

879
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,370
there are putting a lot of downward

880
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,920
pressure on the pricing and possibly the

881
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,470
all of the fancier radios as well so

882
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,390
it's hard to see where this is going

883
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,849
save because you can buy as people

884
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,950
pointed out you can buy one valve you

885
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,540
can buy two or three columns for the

886
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,119
price of a more expensive radio and yes

887
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,619
that more expensive radio may have

888
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,630
Bluetooth and GPS and other stuff

889
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,059
built-in but it makes it a very hard

890
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,609
sell and you can just get a regular you

891
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:51,950
can toss aside even if the manual isn't

892
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,089
the best one stuff

893
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,049
interference amateur radio is greater

894
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,930
than part 15 devices generally part 15

895
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,890
being those devices you have which which

896
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,960
you buy all this devices you in elements

897
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,859
a may not cause interference but may not

898
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,920
cause generate it caused any offense but

899
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,390
if they get interfered what if they have

900
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,400
to accept it that's that's pretty much

901
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,650
all your home to buy little devices with

902
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,849
computers and stuff in them so if a

903
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:29,739
maturity is interfering technically

904
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,319
you're being you're not causing me

905
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:34,719
anything illegal there but you're gonna

906
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,390
very much set your neighbor's other

907
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,279
their services are greater than amateur

908
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,390
aid you know if you're interfering with

909
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,509
aircraft or something you're in trouble

910
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:46,229
on general though it's best to be nice

911
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,329
this does not mean intentionally

912
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:51,069
transmit that full power to try and blow

913
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:53,619
someone else's stereo I have heard every

914
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,599
case where someone actually did that and

915
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,849
it worked but I don't recommend doing

916
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,440
manage that you probably would get a

917
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,329
trawler the trouble of someone actually

918
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:05,739
found out but we have interference

919
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,569
ideally do you want to try and eliminate

920
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:09,849
it at the source with your like a

921
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,710
low-pass filter or a high-pass or

922
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,859
bandpass if you're trying to get it you

923
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:17,380
seem like also a choke on a USB or power

924
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,450
cable or something coming also it's an

925
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,640
attempt also to keep power from either

926
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,430
getting into or out of the device you

927
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,779
may have purchased where the system is

928
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:32,349
having issues rules enforcement it's

929
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,130
primarily self of hopefully Singh one

930
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,430
thing I will note which is a recent

931
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,999
development

932
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:41,769
the official observer program can may

933
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,509
reach right about is replaced with

934
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:47,739
volunteer monitoring I still get if you

935
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,489
can if you get too bad the only they'll

936
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,289
just tell you politely please fix this

937
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,999
out there but if not they may refer to

938
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,910
the FCC FCC in general doesn't really

939
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,279
have the budget that they'd like to have

940
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:02,529
now as much as they used to in terms of

941
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:04,989
enforcement but if you are and if you're

942
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,029
something like commercial radio station

943
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:08,369
or something

944
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,539
you didn't get to the lovely you know

945
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,279
where the FCC you're they're going to

946
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:12,420
make you pay for it

947
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,569
very I've rarely read a finds ten twenty

948
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:19,230
thirty thousand dollars so but ideally

949
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,269
you don't want to get to that point

950
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:23,700
buddy I didn't think it's very rare for

951
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,319
it to get to the point I can think of

952
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,150
one example in Broward County where

953
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,279
someone is constantly interfering with

954
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,109
things and jamming for the fun of it

955
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:33,029
where it probably will get to that point

956
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:38,430
but that's generally not the rule that's

957
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,220
it how are you in your house like here's

958
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,740
an example of a lovely cut caused from a

959
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,259
declaration for a condominium somewhere

960
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:49,730
in Palm Beach County no I am radios

961
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,700
without permission of the board this Cup

962
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,859
it also comes from an interesting errand

963
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,359
in nineteen nineties where I think the

964
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,309
HOA lawyers thought they were more

965
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,130
powerful than the government I had a few

966
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,720
people tell me a clause like this

967
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,049
probably is not legally enforceable but

968
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,150
how much do you really want to try and

969
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,069
prove that is always the case

970
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:17,239
over-the-air reception device Act is

971
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,569
another in law out there is law it's not

972
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:24,599
an HOA rule it's actually a law which

973
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,910
allows is what allows you to have a TV

974
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,880
dish antenna within the quote unquote

975
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,910
area of exclusive use of your house it

976
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,430
overrides some HOA missile restrictions

977
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,980
for these this does not mean I I can

978
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,440
think of another Association who has a

979
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,150
clause which attempts to say that all

980
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,249
the little things in the hotel are still

981
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:46,289
requires you to go through there's there

982
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:49,710
committee and have your have your

983
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,450
satellite dish approved even if it's

984
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,720
fully inside your house and as they

985
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
still go through all your liberals and

986
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,980
their little beautification committees

987
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,430
and stuff I can also read an FCC opinion

988
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,140
which line by line strap down one of

989
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,430
those clauses that said overall taller

990
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,319
does not cover amateur radio so you

991
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,239
cannot use that as the basis for having

992
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,309
having an antenna inside of your booth

993
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:16,319
fully enclosed patio even if it's not

994
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,700
poking outside of your house PR b1 is

995
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,010
the closest thing to a now

996
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,690
- radio : but only applies to new

997
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,940
colonies basically says municipality

998
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,550
can't deny you having a reasonably sized

999
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,740
antennas stuff but does not override

1000
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,590
certain concerns so we're still writing

1001
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,420
for illiterates legislation to cover

1002
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,810
amateur radio an HOA is amateur radio

1003
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,240
carried yeah to the people you proposed

1004
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,390
it's passed Congress general it's

1005
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,280
probably Don't Ask Don't Tell but if

1006
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,890
you're causing problems like someone's

1007
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,260
DSL modem starts going nuts every time

1008
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,290
you try and transmit you may have to try

1009
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,810
and work with them it's probably just

1010
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,530
best to be polite and proactive you may

1011
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,840
have to find yourself buying little RF

1012
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,550
church and stuff to put on their stuff

1013
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,130
if you absolutely have to but it's

1014
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,980
probably on you just in general because

1015
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,540
they're not going to the other person

1016
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,680
who's having interference isn't

1017
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,060
necessarily going to know what to do

1018
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,090
getting a license who can get a license

1019
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,940
in the u.s. anyone pretty much who's not

1020
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,620
an agent of a foreign government that

1021
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,680
said if you were convicted of a felony

1022
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,480
there's a more recent requirement if

1023
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,120
you're doing anything with the FCC where

1024
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,570
you have to discuss provide an exhibit

1025
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,460
explaining why giving you a license is

1026
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,260
in the public interest notwithstanding

1027
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,340
the conduct uh there was a steady I saw

1028
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,010
right about this it does not it does not

1029
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,260
look like the FCC is really denied to

1030
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,210
anyone for the most part if they had a

1031
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,700
felony for provided they provided this

1032
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,800
exhibit and that exhibit though is

1033
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,660
public information usually though that

1034
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,910
some of them have been filed privately

1035
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,470
there is no age limit on amateur radio

1036
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,540
how old you have to be to be licensed my

1037
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,090
family it was before cellphones amateur

1038
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,590
radio was the daddy color to see how

1039
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,560
close daddy was to being home and

1040
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,210
licenses are generally valid for 10

1041
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:19,070
years that said you have to hear some

1042
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,190
online systems to get your license the

1043
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,260
FCC has a system called cores which

1044
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,960
currently has two versions online one is

1045
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,310
what's referred to as the FCC

1046
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,860
registration number as your user name

1047
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,990
there's a newer system out there which

1048
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,180
can handle multiple FCC registration

1049
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,960
numbers

1050
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,599
uh you want to get your FCC registration

1051
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,140
number before testing why do I say that

1052
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,030
it's because as part of the frm

1053
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,859
registration process you have to give

1054
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:47,990
the FCC your social security number and

1055
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,390
other information that is not set public

1056
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,089
but it you will have to give it to them

1057
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:58,490
what part of the stuff the FCC does with

1058
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,410
the application is a so-called red light

1059
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,240
review where they make sure you don't

1060
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,130
owe them and possibly other divisions of

1061
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:07,119
the government and money

1062
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,040
the u.s. is this other system which is

1063
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,500
what refers to is the is so basically

1064
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,540
you think of course as their equivalent

1065
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,600
of Active Directory or their sam'l

1066
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,160
authentication provider whether it's

1067
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,700
their authentication system the OLS is a

1068
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,550
separate system which focuses on

1069
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,730
licensing that said when you finally get

1070
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,410
your license you do not want to download

1071
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,120
the public reference copy of your

1072
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,350
license you just look your name up

1073
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,730
search in the public we're gonna say

1074
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,680
logging download my reference copy the

1075
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,020
license that's not the one you want you

1076
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,720
want to log into you LS currently using

1077
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,750
your upper run password FD support email

1078
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,910
password login form and download your

1079
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,740
electronic authorization to get the

1080
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,870
official copy of your license to post

1081
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,540
around your house or wherever your carry

1082
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,090
with you all operating this is that

1083
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,220
license of this public but you put your

1084
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,740
phone number or your social security

1085
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,060
number something the course registration

1086
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,940
that is not public information if you

1087
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,670
had a business registration you you

1088
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,440
would have to worry about it and you

1089
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,450
only need one fo ID number even though

1090
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:15,160
the newer system can support multiple

1091
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,900
SETI guys there's lots of ways to study

1092
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,750
if you get an AR L study guide it's

1093
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,190
going to probably focus on the theory

1094
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,690
then tell you to read the test questions

1095
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,090
at the end of each chapter you can also

1096
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,340
get study guides which focus on the test

1097
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,710
questions with furious commentary as you

1098
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,040
go through them the w5y group tends to

1099
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,250
use those questions peers themselves are

1100
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,260
updated every four years but they're

1101
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,880
fully public information you can find

1102
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,160
all sorts of websites where you can play

1103
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,600
with the question pool some one will

1104
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,430
require you to log in see them some

1105
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,800
won't some will just let you download

1106
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,330
the entire question pool and you can

1107
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,870
just read it yourself and all if unless

1108
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,400
you're going for the flowing high class

1109
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,170
license you don't have to worry about

1110
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:03,050
any upcoming explorations taking the

1111
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,350
exam all non exams are in person there

1112
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,790
was there's some talk

1113
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,950
possibilities while grouping and last I

1114
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,720
looked into the feasibility if you could

1115
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,120
do this online but as far as I know no

1116
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,820
one has come up with the ability

1117
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,930
volunteer exam coordinator groups

1118
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,690
administer it decades ago you had to go

1119
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,200
to the F

1120
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,060
see to take the exam that has not been

1121
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,359
the case for a very long time these are

1122
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:28,490
often done monthly large events such as

1123
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,000
Def Con have their own exam inventions

1124
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,410
smaller events as well what to bring

1125
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:40,880
photo ID F remember pencils calculator I

1126
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,970
probably non-programmable is best

1127
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,530
photocopy of anything I don't think a

1128
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,329
certificate of successful completions

1129
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:49,010
really are relevant because you can't

1130
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,329
really get one license it's getting a

1131
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,520
previous I doubt most examiner's will

1132
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,500
let you take a higher level thing

1133
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,720
without taking the lower level one first

1134
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,109
I think this is exam there's an exam fee

1135
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:02,720
that's me often done this is the only

1136
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,550
time you have to pay a third party to do

1137
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,589
anything with your license I mentioned

1138
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:08,210
this because once you get your license

1139
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,640
you'll get say congratulations

1140

1141

I do what please here here's our catalog

1142
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:17,930

00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,490
from us and twenty other things but you

1144
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,500

1145

1147
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,069
don't have to do that you don't have to

1148
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,609
go through a the EC's for anything after

1149
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,020
this point you can just do it with the

1150
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,359
FCC directly unless you really want to

1151
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:42,800
use a VEC to on various national

1152
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,890
societies that promote amateur radio us

1153
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,319
this amateur radio relay League they'll

1154
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,210
obviously send you something once you

1155
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,069
get your license but membership is not

1156
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,440
required it's also lots of local amateur

1157
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,650
radio groups I could refer you to

1158
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,819
there's also like national other

1159
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:00,800
national groups out there like tapper

1160
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,109
Luther stood for a Tuscan area pocket

1161
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:05,480
radio but now there are national new a

1162
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,020
lot of other stuff it's amateur radio

1163
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,569
growing fortunately my favorite site

1164
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:13,369
fool keenest information out what

1165
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:15,619
doesn't have stopped updating for some

1166
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:18,349
reason but there's probably or this

1167
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,270
point probably around 800,000 amateur

1168
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,290
radio operators also the average length

1169
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,089
of the license is more than the

1170
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,940
half-life for the license so in terms of

1171
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,859
raw numbers amateur radio is still

1172
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:33,740
growing the licenses that are not

1173
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,010
expiring is fad

1174
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,070
they're being added this does not

1175
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,870
necessarily mean that your people are

1176
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,010
very active unfortunately either a lot

1177
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,810
of people are just got their license in

1178
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:49,580
our Idol I tend to be pretty idle myself

1179
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:54,000
I know if you look at an actual amateur

1180
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,530
radio club a lot of them tend to be

1181
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,350
older than to hack my enemy groups just

1182
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,400
on average on conclusion it's amateur

1183
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,940
radio I'm not quite sure I was hoping

1184
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,170
maybe someone would have had questions

1185
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,200
or wanting to go into a topic but that's

1186
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,260
basically everything I had to say on the

1187
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,460
subject and you get so many questions

1188
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,370
the things um if you want I can hop in

1189
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,810
here just to let a couple of quick

1190
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,560
things and mind you I'm not licensed for

1191
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,720
a ham radio operator but let's go clean

1192
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,800
more and I've actually been kind of

1193
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,990
studying a bit honest topic over the

1194
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,830
last year or so we both purchased from

1195
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,690
Mike's electronics which is over by Fort

1196
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,120
Lauderdale Executive Airport he's not

1197
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,730
open all the time but he is still open

1198
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,700
and you can get the a I'm sorry the ARL

1199
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,040
ham radio license manual from there

1200
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,840
which is really good it's got a lot of

1201
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,240
great stuff in it and one of the things

1202
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,190
that I also purchased a little while

1203
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,550
back was there's a book called pastor

1204
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,680
amateur radio technician class the easy

1205
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,410
way and what this guy basically did was

1206
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,140
he's been an ally since radio guy for a

1207
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,660
long time and he did something that I

1208
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,150
ultimately did earlier he basically took

1209
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,640
downloaded all the questions the entire

1210
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,220
pool set from ARR l's website which

1211
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,920
anybody can do and what I did was I went

1212
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,750
and basically deleted all the wrong

1213
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,120
answers so if you look in the events on

1214
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,210
slack I've basically posted a PDF that I

1215
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,090
created that is the entire test pool of

1216
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,190
questions but what I've done was I've

1217
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,350
eliminated all the wrong answers so it

1218
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,510
makes the book a lot smaller easier to

1219
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:36,600
go through and should help you out as

1220
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,670
far as memorization and random if you

1221
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,320
still probably want to go through them a

1222
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,540
full licence book as far as like I just

1223
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,980
don't understand really what is you're

1224
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,890
talking about but for just purposes of

1225
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,930
passing the test this PDF file that I've

1226
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,000
up there it's a stupid easy way to get

1227
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,890
actually get there and like I said that

1228
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:57,270
easy way by Craig buck k4 ia is also a

1229
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,190
good very good book it's a bathroom book

1230
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,680
if you will anyways yeah that's an

1231
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,900
extent I'd say take doing an exam like

1232
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,540
that is kind of you should you should

1233
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,220
know the theory at least behind all the

1234
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,619
basic math question them the theories

1235
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:13,140
stuff but I I can understand your

1236
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,710
wanting to memorize like questions on

1237
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,569
I'm like what is this frequency range

1238
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:21,329
that I'm allowed to use on this band if

1239
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:24,359
they're giving very similar examples but

1240
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:26,640
I would say it's best to understand the

1241
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,369
theory not just why specific answer is

1242
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,109
color right and that's what I said I

1243
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:33,420
also advocate getting the full big red

1244
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,119
the big red book the ham radio license

1245
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,880
manual from ARRL which fool is going one

1246
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,220
more infest use sources as far as co big

1247
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,640
19 and Mike's electronics Mike's is an

1248
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,380
example the local store were very

1249
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,119
fortunate to have one in South Florida

1250
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,010
that's stroll around because a lot of

1251
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,069
those don't exist anymore

1252
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,020
there's also a lot of national change if

1253
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,569
you had he gets equipment internet that

1254
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:02,609
will provide ship it from elsewhere in

1255
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,760
the country we have to get stuff Mike's

1256
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,859
electronics no for covert nineteen I

1257
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:09,780
think he's only open in the mornings and

1258
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,730
you have to call it advance and possibly

1259
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,990
see what he's doing but his stuff okay

1260
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,160
that might be possible cuz last time

1261
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,210
claymore and I went there it was

1262
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,180
actually like goes before the whole

1263
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,880
coronavirus thing so he does have coded

1264
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,000
19 hours and restrictions but you'd have

1265
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,290
to call them I think you have to call

1266
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:33,390
them in advance hey Sam I got a question

1267
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:36,869
for you this is a Phil I'm actually

1268
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:39,420
going to be doing the SDR talk in a few

1269
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,910
weeks here do you have any

1270
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,290
recommendations for booked not

1271
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,020
necessarily related to the test in

1272
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,670
particular but more as you're saying the

1273
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:52,349
theory and fundamentals a lot of the

1274
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:57,119
books focus on if you have a license a

1275
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,660
book problem they are all probably the

1276
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,250
book that's probably

1277
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,750
the most common one out there though

1278
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,960
it's a very very very thick book is if

1279
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,280
you wanted to go into all sorts of

1280
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,290
details have lots of things is the ARL

1281
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,800
handbook which they update yearly which

1282
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,810
is just a whole book full of articles

1283
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,930
and how do you do all sorts of crazy RF

1284
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,350
in other things

1285
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,120
anybody who wants like manual stuff for

1286
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,030
that I've got a crap ton of PDFs hit me

1287
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,680
up and I can definitely send them over

1288
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,930
to you I got everything from antenna

1289
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:36,770
theory to radio theory so excellent I

1290
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:44,520
got a question yes okay I thought that

1291
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,740
Danielle was speaking so I went and got

1292
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,890
my technician license uh kind of on a

1293
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,040
whim so what's a good starting radio to

1294
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,770
get I'm not eager to drop 1200 bucks or

1295
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,770
even you know 300 bucks what are you

1296
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,240
trying to do what you're just trying to

1297
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,210
talk locally um I don't know just good

1298
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,920
introduction radio right I mean I got

1299
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,300
the license they don't know what to do

1300
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,250
with it so I just wonder I don't know

1301
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,070
good decent doctor said I guess I mean

1302
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,660
well you could start with like handheld

1303
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,820
handheld Stone tend to be very expensive

1304
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,300
radios if you have a local like repeater

1305
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,520
to talk to you should also like us to be

1306
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,410
looking to getting involved with your

1307
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,390
local amateur radio groups some of them

1308
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,070
like it's a group in Palm Beach County

1309
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,860
has its own Shack sitting in the park

1310
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,490
and that's a good possibly a good issue

1311
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,170
should look around and see what they

1312
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,930
recommend I would say this room so I

1313
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,970
don't know it's very it's a very open

1314
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,200
question if you're just looking to

1315
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,780
casually talk to someone locally then

1316
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,360
you just need a little handheld might be

1317
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,940
sufficient for your use but if you're

1318
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,670
looking to Talk Talk internationally

1319
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,680
then you're probably you look and you're

1320
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,780
probably looking at plus if you have

1321
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,580
room putting a dipole outside of your

1322
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,220
house or something which is just a lot

1323
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,640
big long line of wire then you might be

1324
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,500
looking which that's very cheap to do

1325
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,900
but then even used you might be looking

1326
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,650
like for like a five foot maybe a $500

1327
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,720
HF radio the HF stuff is

1328
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,550
probably a lot more expensive than the

1329
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,920
FM radios could they do a lot more bands

1330
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,190
and stuff and even older HF radios tend

1331
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,020
to hold a lot of their value for

1332
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,589
whatever reason primarily because you

1333
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:30,150
basic radio theory has not changed much

1334
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,160
two years even if you

1335
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,079
they don't have built-in fancy digital

1336
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,660
signal processors and things waterfall

1337
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,329
diagrams and stuff that an SDR what

1338
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:43,410
radio can do yeah there are a lot of

1339
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,589
good STRs out there you can find on

1340
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,630
Amazon and on the web is also there is a

1341
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,359
couple of good backpack radios I was

1342
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,920
trying to actually put the link in this

1343
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,660
go me Channel it's not letting me for

1344
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,210
some reason but like for 200 bucks you

1345
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,589
can get a pretty decent powerful

1346
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:00,750
backpack radio with a 10 hour battery

1347
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:06,150
life I mean I mentioned that the bow

1348
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,390
Fung is getting one that play with a

1349
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,640
good idea or not and if so which one

1350
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,160
they seem to have quite a few models

1351
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,230
that roughly the same price range

1352
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,740
I think the bow things are actually OK

1353
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,660
for a starter radio just don't admit

1354
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,740
that your ATS what you're actually

1355
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,780
talking on because they a lot of the

1356
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,990
amateur radio guys blast the the bow

1357
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:30,540
thanks another good resource to look at

1358
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,099
also for those of you guys who actually

1359
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:34,020
are on Facebook there's plenty of ham

1360
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,760
radio groups that actually can share a

1361
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,380
lot of information as well I've done a

1362
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,010
lot with those guys yes it is possible

1363
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,329
to walk down a bow phone so just

1364
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:44,280
transmits on the amateur radio bands

1365
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,670
I've done it but it's you have budded

1366
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,410
that sends to be aware of something else

1367
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:52,140
with a bow phone I'll be sure to set the

1368
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,180
alarm mode to local otherwise you may

1369
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,250
find yourself accidentally transmitting

1370
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,930
the siren over the all over the place

1371
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,280
alright guys any other questions for Sam

1372
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,490
will or claim on or so actually I'm a

1373
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,930
couple people joined in on that

1374
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:25,770
all right well fine one of the guys

1375
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,780
mentioned the book that eliminates all

1376
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,930
the wrong answers I just I didn't quite

1377
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,730
catch that if you can maybe I don't know

1378
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,490
maybe put in a chat or

1379
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:40,009
it's the events it's called ham dot PDF

1380
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,950
yes just like channel those also on the

1381
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,280
slack Channel / system for the % 27

1382
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,590
slack they don't call it the channel ham

1383
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,360
radio but there's the channel radio

1384
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:57,290
frequencies yeah all right

1385
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:01,440
are you part of the black I'm sorry are

1386
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,800
you in black with us no I am NOT I just

1387
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,440
I saw that I saw this event on my own

1388
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,850
app and I just join if you would kindly

1389

invited to our channel give me your

1391
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,680
address and I'll send it on to the

1392
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:22,110
Edmonton cool organizing you can direct

1393

directly from hit me up it's it's not

1396
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,430
something that's not even a full neck is

1397
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,520
any William knit okay let's make will

1398
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,750
net at gmail.com

1399
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,380
all right Henry is up next well did you

1400
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,240
want to do any kind of introduction or

1401
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,000
are we just going to turn it on and ring

1402
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,600
no I think Henry should go for it all

1403
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,320
right Henry are you ready to go yep

1404
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,980
perfect I am making you the presenter

1405
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:18,050
please you are the presenter dang it cat

1406
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:22,850
all right take it away Thanks

1407
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:26,170
so we're going to talk about mini cats

1408
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,640
just a quick run-through about what it

1409
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,130
is its uses and how it's been integrated

1410
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,010
into other tools so you'll have a lot of

1411
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:40,640
flexibility now in order to understand

1412
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,640
we will have to briefly go through

1413
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,980
Active Directory authentication I'll try

1414
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,650
to cover that part faster than the rest

1415
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,200
so what is mini cats it's an open source

1416
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,380
tool that allows to view and save

1417
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,330
authentication credentials so you're

1418
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:02,450
you're in a workstation you can use

1419
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,600
mimic ads to dump it credentials you can

1420
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,830
see clear text passwords you can see

1421
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,540
password hashes stuff like that with

1422
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,660
that you can just copy the credentials

1423
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,410
you can if you don't have the clearances

1424
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:21,020
clear text password or plain text

1425
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:24,290
password George's and you have a hash

1426
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,330
you can actually dispatch the hash of

1427
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:31,330
the password to authenticate you can use

1428
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,980
Kerberos golden and silver tickets and

1429
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,100
pass those tickets there's also a

1430
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,350
technique called pass a key or over pass

1431
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,050
a hash we're gonna talk about that but

1432
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,390
basically basically a bunch of different

1433
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:45,440
attacks open up

1434
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,810
once you use mimikatz and obtain this

1435
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,500
information from the workstation so it

1436
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,050
looks kind of like this it does require

1437
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:58,340
admin rights so basically you run the

1438
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,810
tool

1439
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,840
you're gonna type privileged debug in

1440
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,540
order to escalate privileges and then

1441
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,820
you'll you'll be able to just dump the

1442
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,450
password

1443
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:11,540
as you can see in the picture you're

1444
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:16,220
gonna see that it says down here and TLM

1445
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,869
that's the password hash and the

1446
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:23,030
plaintext password that will come from

1447
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,579
it now with that you can do whatever you

1448
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:28,070
need with those credentials either login

1449
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,079
into a particular account or like I said

1450
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,780
if it's common to be in a corporate

1451
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,310
environment where you were gonna have

1452
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,440
Active Directory so let's try to quickly

1453
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,130
cover Active Directory authentication

1454
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:46,070
which basically just falls into two

1455
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,000
different categories either ntlm and

1456
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,320
Kerberos they're technically not

1457
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,190
mutually exclusive you can find a domain

1458
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,109
controller that would allow you to

1459
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:59,570
authenticate through ntlm well while

1460
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:02,839
it's actually using Kerberos with other

1461
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,109
devices so it's not necessarily mutually

1462
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:08,690
exclusive but normally you will see it

1463
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,839
in a way that it's somewhat is like

1464
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,450
basically just focusing on Kerberos or

1465
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,849
it has a bunch of legacy stuff so it's

1466
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:20,420
basically stuff with ntlm the difference

1467
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,970
between them one is basically a

1468
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,190
challenge response style of

1469
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,260
authentication we're gonna see it in

1470
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,329
detail in a little bit but it uses

1471
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:35,230
password hashes that are easier to crack

1472
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:38,030
where the rest Kurvers uses tickets and

1473
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:41,569
uses AES encryption and this is using

1474
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:44,510
again some legacy system with DES but if

1475
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,670
it's using AES it's gonna be harder to

1476
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,670
crack so let's so just a quick overview

1477
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:54,560
on ntlm and how it works

1478
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,730
it's super easy basically the user

1479
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:01,690
authenticates with an application server

1480
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:05,270
and says hey this is my user the user

1481
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,970
will repair the application server will

1482
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,099
reply with a challenge which is also

1483
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:12,020
called a nun's it's just a random value

1484
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:17,119
and then this nonce gets encrypted with

1485
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,910
the password hash and is sent back as a

1486
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,340
response now the application servers

1487
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,930
grab the response is going to grab the

1488
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,970
nonce is going to talked with the domain

1489
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,560
controller and say hey this guy is

1490
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,750
trying to authenticate with me this is

1491
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,940
the number that I gave him this is his

1492
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,010
response because the domain controller

1493
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,980
also has the same password hash for that

1494
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,920
user it will be able to also encrypt the

1495
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,500
nonce compare it with the result that

1496
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,840
the user encrypted and if it is the same

1497
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,870
then the authentication is a success and

1498
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,880
the user will be allowed to access

1499
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,890
whatever they were trying to access on

1500
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:59,240
that particular service or server now

1501
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,030
for Kerberos I try to simplified it I'm

1502
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,860
not entirely sure if I actually managed

1503
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,450
to do that but I'm gonna try to go

1504
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,870
through it a little bit faster this one

1505
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,790
I truly an easy way to see it is that it

1506
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,230
works the other way around instead of

1507
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:16,670
asking the server hey I need to access

1508
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,530
something and then that server

1509
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,120
communicating with a domain controller

1510
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,670
in this case you're authenticated

1511
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,220
directly with the domain controller

1512
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:27,260
you're gonna get a ticket granting

1513
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,050
ticket that basically allows you to come

1514
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,420
back with that and say hey now I want to

1515
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:36,800
use a particular resource so in order to

1516
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,240
get that resource from the domain

1517
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,560
controller you say hey remember that

1518
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,390
I've already authenticated here's my

1519
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,060
ticket granting ticket now I need a

1520
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,670
service ticket to be able to go and talk

1521
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:51,740
with whatever service or server you're

1522
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,390
trying to access whatever resource

1523
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:55,100
within the network you're trying to

1524
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,680
access you'll have to follow those steps

1525
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,710
you're gonna see actually that pretty

1526
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:03,410
much encryption it's at every single

1527
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:07,430
step of the process so at first you are

1528
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,740
encrypting occurrence time timestamp

1529
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,530
that's to avoid replay attacks with the

1530
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,140
hash derived from the username and

1531
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,840
password you send that to the domain

1532
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,520
controller the domain controller sends

1533
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,730
back a ticket granting ticket that it's

1534
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:25,670
encrypted with a password only known to

1535
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:29,630
the authentication server once you get

1536
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,640
that ticket you can communicate back

1537
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,290
with the domain controller and start

1538
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:36,290
asking for service tickets which

1539
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,180
in turn are encrypted but with a

1540
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,430
different password that is known to both

1541
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:43,070
the domain controller and the

1542
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:44,720
application server that you're trying to

1543
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,830
access now why is this important because

1544
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:52,340
if we go back here remember that we

1545
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,310
talked about Kerberos golden and silver

1546
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:58,340
tickets okay so now that we understand

1547
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,140
the concept of how all of this ticket

1548
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,780
works back and forth basically a generic

1549
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,250
ticket from the domain controller a

1550
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,440
particular service ticket for each

1551
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,850
service that you need to access so now

1552
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,820
I'm going to talk about mimikatz

1553
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,560
within other tools performing these

1554
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,290
different types of attacks that is over

1555
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,350
pass the hash golden tickets silver

1556
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,930
tickets but at the same time I wanted to

1557
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,670
show you how you can do this with mini

1558
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,060
cuts actually within other tools so you

1559
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,630
can expand on what you can do with

1560
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,640
another engagement you're gonna have a

1561
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,680
bunch of different tools such as the USB

1562
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,700
rubber ducky

1563
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,009
which is basically if it's mostly known

1564
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:42,319
for the physical social engineering that

1565
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,259
will allow you to get an initial

1566
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:48,710
foothold or you can steal credentials

1567
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:50,420
with it if you plug it in with memeing

1568
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:50,899
cuts

1569
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:53,270
it will run me me cuts real quick copy

1570
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,729
their credentials back to the USB unplug

1571
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:57,580
it and let's say you have the

1572
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,160
credentials stored on the USB Drive

1573
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,238
another tool that we're gonna see is

1574
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,988
PowerShell Empire which actually mini

1575
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:09,259
cuts benefits a lot if you manage to run

1576
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:12,140
it from PowerShell instead of on its

1577
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,660
standalone version or or or through the

1578
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,549
command so a combination between

1579
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:18,738
PowerShell Empire which actually has a

1580
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,920
module for me that's already embedded in

1581
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,880
it will benefit a lot mutually benefit a

1582
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,450
lot from being able to get into a device

1583
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:34,700
escalating privileges and dumping a

1584
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,380
bunch of credentials and then navigating

1585
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,609
around into other devices in the network

1586
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:44,689
pivoting stuff like that and then the

1587
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:45,710
Metasploit framework

1588
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:48,170
similarly known for it for the

1589
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:50,149
exploitation and post exploitation

1590
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:54,530
face in particular meterpreter will have

1591
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,230
also a module for mimic that's already

1592
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,179
embedded in it so as soon as you are

1593
01:09:59,179 --> 01:10:01,460
exploiting or running through the post

1594
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,860
exploitation steps one of the things

1595
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,380
that you will be able to do is run mimic

1596
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,190
ads and obtain credentials authenticate

1597
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:13,969
pass the hash ticket etc so we'll see

1598
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:16,400
how that looks

1599
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,920
starting off with the USB rubber ducky I

1600
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,949
also wanted to add a couple of other

1601
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:24,560
devices one of them is the G spark 80

1602
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,000
tiny as the one that you see on the

1603
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,730
right it doesn't come with a case unlike

1604
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:30,830
the rubber ducky and it doesn't come

1605
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,989
with an SD card reader you can probably

1606
01:10:32,989 --> 01:10:36,110
attach one to it but it's kind of wide

1607
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,540
to actually put it inside a case unlike

1608
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,449
the Wi-Fi dock which also does think

1609
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,900
with an S car SD card reader but it does

1610
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,870
come with an ESP so it has Wi-Fi it's

1611
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,420
basically the same thing as a wife the

1612
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,840
USB rubber ducky but you can plug it in

1613
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,670
leave it in there and then control it

1614
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,820
remotely through Wi-Fi whichever the

1615
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,630
case may be

1616
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,540
with all of them you will be able to do

1617
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,820
an attack that basically you plug it in

1618
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:09,550
you request mini cuts from the internet

1619
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:14,000
I'll show that in a bit you request me

1620
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,190
me cuts either from another computer in

1621
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:20,120
the network from mimic ads website in

1622
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,670
github stuff like that

1623
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,500
but only with a rubber ducky because of

1624
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,960
the SD card you'll be able to make the

1625
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,600
SD card show as a USB mass storage

1626
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,140
device and you will be able to run mini

1627
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:40,400
cuts from there now whichever route you

1628
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,409
choose in both cases you'll be able to

1629
01:11:42,409 --> 01:11:46,070
run mini cuts obtain credentials dump a

1630
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:49,250
bunch of stuff that you need for that

1631
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:52,610
for further attacks so the top example

1632
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,550
this is just a piece of a script in the

1633
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,989
top example you see that it's running

1634
01:11:56,989 --> 01:11:59,650
PowerShell and that it's basically

1635
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:04,040
downloading the mini cuts executable

1636
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,760
into a local computer you can like I say

1637
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,210
you can do this either by just going to

1638
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:14,960
github or just opening up an Apache

1639
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,970
server let's say you have Kali or within

1640
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:17,750
the network

1641
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,570
you open up Apache server you copy

1642
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,460
mimikatz in it and then you go with a

1643
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,140
rubber ducky to another computer and

1644
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:28,310
you'll be able to load it the cool thing

1645
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,900
about the rubber ducky like I say you

1646
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,080
can share the SD card just put mini cuts

1647
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,710
inside and then you'll be able to take

1648
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,900
the rubber duck you plug it in it will

1649
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,650
automatically run me me cuts run what it

1650
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,510
needs in order to dump the credentials

1651
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,570
save it to the USB and you unplug it and

1652
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:49,340
keep working and that's gonna happen

1653
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:55,100
super fast with the rubber ducky now

1654
01:12:55,100 --> 01:13:00,530
with PowerShell Empire I wanted to start

1655
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,690
talking about past a hash and overpass

1656
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:04,910
ahead if you're using PowerShell Empire

1657
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:08,120
which you might be using to let's say

1658
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,520
for the initial social engineering

1659
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,400
attack you're doing spearfishing you

1660
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,410
grab a file a Word document you embed it

1661
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:18,860
with a PowerShell Empire you send it and

1662
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:22,880
once it opens you start you need to

1663
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,260
start gaining a little bit of

1664
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,670
information about the device that you're

1665
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,980
in other devices in the network and then

1666
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,440
eventually move to those devices or try

1667
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,690
to obtain information from it so in

1668
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:35,120
order to do this you can use of course

1669
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,820
mini cuts so once PowerShell Empire is

1670
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,640
running you can just type mini cuts or

1671
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,920
you can actually load different modules

1672
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,130
from it once you load them you'll be

1673
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,440
able to just obtain the same just like

1674
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,910
we saw at the beginning when you obtain

1675
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:55,670
the just the password hat and then if

1676
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,850
you're in a situation where you have

1677
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,830
ntlm authentication you'll be able to

1678
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:03,890
just pass the hash and do regular ntlm

1679
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,830
authentication or mini cuts allows you

1680
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,510
to do something really cool that it's

1681
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,970
called over pass the hash and basically

1682
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:14,450
it allows you to get full Kerberos

1683
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,480
ticket with just a password hash in

1684
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:17,840
order to

1685
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,570
do that you'll see the command that is

1686
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:23,540
in the picture you see the command in

1687
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,570
order to obtain the hash but on the top

1688
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:28,490
of the slide you're gonna see the

1689
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,650
command that it requires a lot more than

1690
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:32,570
the other one that just is like you're

1691
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:35,090
just specifying logon passwords to just

1692
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:37,580
dump the credentials in this case you're

1693
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:41,270
gonna add a bunch of different things

1694
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:45,950
like the the username that you just

1695
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,800
found the domain in which you're in the

1696
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,490
ntlm hash that you're the judges got

1697
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:56,180
with mini cards and then an app to run

1698
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,680
again you can run PowerShell ideally and

1699
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,500
you leverage it a lot more than your

1700
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,390
regular command prompt once you do that

1701
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:10,970
mimikatz is gonna create or basically

1702
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:14,210
prepare a ticket for you but remember

1703
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,100
the way that Kerberos works you actually

1704
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,780
need to go to the domain controller and

1705
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:20,270
authenticate with it so what you can do

1706
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:22,580
is just use whatever network research

1707
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,310
either shared storage or whatever you

1708
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:26,990
need in order to obtain something that

1709
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:31,850
will require authentication and now that

1710
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,040
that information is there thanks to

1711
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,920
mimic at you'll be you will be able to

1712
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,160
authenticate with Kerberos and you will

1713
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:48,320
be able to generate a ticket for it so

1714
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,360
now let's talk about the next tool which

1715
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,580
is the Metasploit framework and let's

1716
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:59,510
talk about now with Kerberos we silver

1717
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,790
and golden tickets with which would

1718
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,830
basically be if you're an apprentice

1719
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:07,400
engagement this would probably be one of

1720
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,500
the coolest things to get because it

1721
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,380
translates into a lot of access either

1722
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,990
to a bunch of servers with a silver

1723
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:20,210
ticket or to the domain controller as an

1724
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:24,380
admin with the golden ticket so first

1725
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,550
let's talk a little bit about the

1726
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,160
Metasploit framework in a similar

1727
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,440
fashion then PowerShell

1728
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,960
Empire it's gonna have a tool it's gonna

1729
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,610
have a bunch of different modules in it

1730
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:40,050
you can leverage a lot of them and use a

1731
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:42,210
bunch of different elements included in

1732
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,160
them in order to pay would move around

1733
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:48,780
gather information etc etc one thing to

1734
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,810
note though even though the mimikatz is

1735
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:53,850
included within the Metasploit framework

1736
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,699
you're gonna see that it's called kiwi i

1737
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,250
would guess it has something to do with

1738
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,199
the fact that the username of the person

1739
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,230
who created me me cut this gentle kiwi

1740
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:06,660
so whoever wrote that plug-in from

1741
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,610
meterpreter probably was referencing

1742
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:11,400
that not entirely sure though but

1743
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,420
whatever the case may be

1744
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,750
you just put load kiwi he will load your

1745
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:20,040
regular mimikatz module and then you'll

1746
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,640
be able to start using your

1747
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,199
old-fashioned minicab commands in order

1748
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:29,040
to create either a golden or a silver

1749
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:34,050
ticket basically if we go back to our

1750
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:37,170
talk about Kerberos and we said that you

1751
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:40,080
first authenticate with a domain

1752
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,660
controller in order to obtain a ticket

1753
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,910
granting ticket it's basically a ticket

1754
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,739
that allows you to get other tickets the

1755
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:51,810
service tickets which you in turn use in

1756
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,640
order to access different services or

1757
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,750
servers around the network if you were

1758
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:02,219
to by using mimikatz obtain any of the

1759
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,250
password hashes for either one of the

1760
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:08,250
servers or better yet for the domain

1761
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:12,300
controller you can craft your own ticket

1762
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:16,140
granting ticket or your own service

1763
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,140
ticket if you create your own service

1764
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,940
ticket that is to access one particular

1765
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:24,360
server and you managed to obtain that

1766
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,830
password hash now you'll be able to

1767
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,989
create a silver ticket using the

1768
01:18:30,989 --> 01:18:32,910
password hash for that particular server

1769
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,090
and with it you can give you permissions

1770
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,610
in order to access everything on that

1771
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,980
particular service when you create your

1772
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,920
own service ticket that allows you to

1773
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,290
access one particular

1774
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,090
server in whichever way you deem

1775
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,630
necessary that's what's called a silver

1776
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:53,000
ticket because it allows you to access

1777
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,600
only one device but with as much access

1778
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,680
as you need now the same thing but

1779
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,470
happening with the domain controller now

1780
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:06,260
it's the domain controller password

1781
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,100
hatch that you have obtained then you

1782
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,870
can use that to create your own ticket

1783
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,790
granting ticket basically the ticket

1784
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,620
that allows you to get all the other

1785
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,380
tickets that one is called a golden

1786
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,590
ticket and one of the cool things it has

1787
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,630
similar to the service ticket the

1788
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,700
service ticket has basically hey what

1789
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,190
does this guy if what is this guy

1790
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,620
allowed to do within the server in a

1791
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,200
similar fashion your golden ticket is

1792
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,230
gonna say what groups does this user

1793
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,720
belong to and since you created it you

1794
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:44,180
can make yourself the domain admin so by

1795
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,150
simply running mimikatz you can see on

1796
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:52,280
the lower screenshot to the right the

1797
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,320
command golden ticket create is actually

1798
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,750
used to create both the silver and the

1799
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,520
golden ticket it just depends like I

1800
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,460
said on on which password hash and you

1801
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:04,010
obtain is it just a service account or

1802
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:08,120
is it domain account depending on

1803
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,840
whether you are on the domain controller

1804
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,900
or one of the servers you create that

1805
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,730
you give yourself the appropriate

1806
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:20,780
permissions or specify that you belong

1807
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:23,690
to the appropriate groups and you'll

1808
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,640
have basically unlimited access to

1809
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,560
either one particular server with a

1810
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,260
silver ticket or choose them in

1811
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,000
controller and to anything else that you

1812
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:39,340
need to with a golden ticket now I

1813
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,590
didn't want to make this talk too long

1814
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:47,840
so I will be doing another talk that

1815
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,180
will be a Red Team intro and one of the

1816
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:53,180
things that we're going to talk about in

1817
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:56,620
it is how to use mini cuts but bypassing

1818
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,520
antivirus on different detection

1819
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,210
software

1820
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:02,240
because the tool is very well known you

1821
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,430
can imagine that a lot of antivirus

1822
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,590
software he's gonna try to pick it up

1823
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:10,010
try to stop it and there's different

1824
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:14,660
techniques in order to try to bypass AV

1825
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,400
since there's different techniques in

1826
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,400
order to actually run mimi cuts you can

1827
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,670
run the executable alone you can get a

1828
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,510
powershell script that will invoke it so

1829
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:27,770
depending on which technique you're

1830
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:29,240
gonna use there will be different

1831
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,850
techniques in order to bypass the

1832
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:35,330
antivirus if it's just a powershell

1833
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,670
script you may just replace a couple of

1834
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,850
the keywords and you'll be able to run

1835
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:44,450
the powershell script in other cases

1836
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:48,080
you'll want to obfuscate the powershell

1837
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,050
script so even the the stuff that is

1838
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:54,850
readable before now won't be able to

1839
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:58,660
whatever antivirus or end point security

1840
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,860
solution won't be able to read it

1841
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,890
because you can actually encrypt it with

1842
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:07,070
AES and of course last but not least

1843
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:10,150
actually encoding and executable and and

1844
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:13,310
trying to run it in a way that doesn't

1845
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:17,840
use anything suspicious for the

1846
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,690
antivirus now all of that is actually

1847
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,470
just too much content so I'm gonna let

1848
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:27,080
that I'm gonna leave that for the red

1849
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,620
team intro and I wanted to leave a

1850
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,250
little bit of time about for questions

1851
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,550
because I know that until M and Kerberos

1852
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:42,770
it might raise some questions as to

1853
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,960
where or how you would actually use

1854
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,030
mimikatz to obtain that information move

1855
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:49,870
forward stuff like that if any of that

1856
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:54,380
wasn't clear enough now

1857
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,290
Oh beyond excellent moment for those

1858
01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:07,330
questions if you guys have questions for

1859
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:10,219
this go ahead and ask them you can

1860
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:12,080
unmute yourself you know if you have any

1861
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:24,650
issues is there any type of cheat sheet

1862
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:26,360
that you draw recommend that you've seen

1863
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,850
out there that we can go right ahead

1864
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:32,929
take a look and really start using it

1865
01:23:32,929 --> 01:23:37,630
specifically with the rubber duckie

1866
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,139
you

1867
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:43,090
yeah so let me go back real quick to

1868
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:45,650
here in so the last line at the bottom

1869
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:49,429
is the source for all of the rubber

1870
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:54,020
ducky stuff that's actually from the guy

1871
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,940
who made the rubber ducky you can go

1872
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,480
over there and actually explains him in

1873
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:04,610
in detail how both attacks would be

1874
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,550
performed one of the cool things about

1875
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,050
the rubber duckies that you can put it

1876
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:13,130
in I believe they call it like twin duck

1877
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:16,460
mode in which it can act as both a

1878
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:20,020
keyboard and USB mass-storage

1879
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:23,630
so you should be able to do all of the

1880
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,969
automation all over typing down all of

1881
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:27,380
the putting the commands that you need

1882
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:30,080
in order to Remy cuts down the

1883
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,560
credentials copy them to a file inside

1884
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,690
that basically second partition that is

1885
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:39,020
the shared SD card and then just unplug

1886
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,150
the rubber ducky and you'll have all of

1887
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:44,259
the credentials in there

1888
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,230
you

1889
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,570
somebody had mentioned in the chat that

1890
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:00,180
there are payload generators online for

1891
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,200
both the rubber ducky and the digi spark

1892
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,850
last year I did a talk on how to make a

1893
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,960
I think was a four dollar rubber ducky

1894
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,480
by using a did you start Ford so Dave

1895
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,490
and I had fun with that and Dave is

1896
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:16,680
reminding everybody that there are those

1897
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,540
payload generators out there for both of

1898
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:22,530
them and Dave is reminding us that the

1899
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:24,330
Digi spark has a much cheaper version

1900
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:26,430
like I said and we did the talk on I'd

1901
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,500
make a $4 rubber ducky with that did you

1902
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:33,570
start yeah you can get like ten no five

1903
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:35,580
for ten bucks so we'll be like two

1904
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:38,750
dollars each and in my case what I do is

1905
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:42,600
because speaking of the rubber ducky and

1906
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,420
even the wife I got even though it's a

1907
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,010
bit cheaper they're still too expensive

1908
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,890
to be like dropping around in an

1909
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:52,530
engagement let's say that you go to the

1910
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:55,290
client go to the parking lot and you

1911
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:57,270
want to drop about a bunch of this USB

1912
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:58,860
so somebody will pick it up on plug it

1913
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,080
in that's probably not something that

1914
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,240
you'll want to do with a $50 rubber

1915
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:03,840
ducky

1916
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,510
but you can buy a pack of five of these

1917
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:12,330
digi sports for 10 bucks and then in my

1918
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:15,420
case I used 3d printer to just print

1919
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,100
that really cheap case because they're

1920
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,760
too wide to actually fit on the regular

1921
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,100
USB case so I just ended up doing my own

1922
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,250
with a really printer which is super

1923
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,600
cheap if you consider the price of a

1924
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,860
filament and I was it a cheap way of

1925
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:33,840
making a rubber ducky that I won mine if

1926
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:43,980
I if I loose after the engagement you

1927
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,110
mentioned there's a red team event that

1928
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,330
you're going to be presenting are you

1929
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:53,100
also planning on doing a presentation of

1930
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,590
the blue team perspective or is that

1931
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,090
something you've done in the past that I

1932
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:08,670
can look up somewhere blue team the demo

1933
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,470
specific to that at least not that what

1934
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:13,530
one that I've gone to I do know that

1935
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:17,310
they recently did a couple of monitoring

1936
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:20,490
ones that would help but at least I am

1937
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:23,040
NOT planning on uncovering this kind of

1938
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,720
stuff from a blue team perspective if I

1939
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:29,640
could do that I I don't think it should

1940
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,210
be I think yeah I think it would be a

1941
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:35,880
good idea to present both both sides of

1942
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,350
it we recently had an issue with a

1943
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:42,900
client which is a client from another

1944
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,910
department so we had we had like no idea

1945
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:50,040
of all of the cyber side and recently we

1946
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,140
had to do a couple of incident response

1947
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,410
and one of the things that we saw is a

1948
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,810
lot of people using PowerShell Empire

1949
