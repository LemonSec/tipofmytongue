meetings Thank You Danielle you you rock

9
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,630
I know many of you we have been talking

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,899
through this lack and I just wanted to

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,690
do a little fYI say it's where we are

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,980
now as a group as of today the 28th so

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,750
the meetings obviously will continue

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,390
online we don't know when this will

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,710
solve or would relent when that happens

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,020
we will obviously will make an

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,620
assessment

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,300
everybody knows the conference has been

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,050
canceled we decided to cancel it and

20
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,320
then then like two days later the

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,880
library pretty much taught us

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,449
yeah we're canceling everything so so it

23
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:05,830
was not gonna happen and unfortunately

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,420

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,700
or experience like we done in the last

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,170
conference for example we had a how to

89
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,390
survive a hurricane and there were some

90
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,370
some great tips about you know how to

91
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,700
deal with like a POW word and and many

92
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,930
other things that are related to that

93
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,019
type of situation I'm sure we can

94
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,029
probably find somebody that can give us

95
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,430
some tips of how to cope with this type

96
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,290
of crisis although it looks like it's

97
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,620
pretty much near for everybody with this

in mind today we're gonna we're gonna

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,760

anything I was I'm perfect thank you so

117
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,499
today we're gonna talk about some

118
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:37,839
introductory to drone security we're

119
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,019
gonna cover three main areas which are

120
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,139
defending from drones that is why there

121
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,329
was a rise in needing to the and from

122
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,239
drones some cool projects in which

123
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,519
people use drones to hack other drones

124
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,189
and then a couple of tips on what you

125
00:05:54,189 --> 00:06:00,519
can do to harden your devices so let's

126
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,019
start with the need from protecting from

127
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,029
drones basically comes from there's

128
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,159
already a bunch of crazy ideas some of

129
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,619
them might look fun like shooting

130
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:15,039
fireworks on an airsoft gun from it but

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,369
you can see how this could be easily

132
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:19,749
weaponized in a worse way and why

133
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:24,369
authorities are worried about what

134
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:25,929
basically a lot of people was considered

135
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:31,809
his toys so there have been other

136
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,599
situations in which people in this case

137
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,999
protesters had a police drone flying

138
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,799
above them and they have this really

139
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,949
powerful green lasers just all of them

140
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,889
pointing them at the bottom part of it

141
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,769
they made it either force it to land or

142
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,379
crash people are not actually sure at

143
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,179
the end I'm gonna leave a bunch of

144
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,829
references you can read the article over

145
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:56,019
there and the different theories of why

146
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,589
the drone came down the most common

147
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,550
think you're gonna see out there are

148
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,390
drone guns they're pretty expensive and

149
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm gonna show you basically the

150
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,430
different components that they have and

151
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,500
in reality they they could be a lot

152
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,990
cheaper but the itself for example for

153
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,690
ten grand or even more but they

154
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,070
basically cover the most common

155
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,810
frequencies 2.5 2.4 gigahertz for a

156
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,180
remote control 5.8 for the video and GPS

157
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,180
GLONASS and other global positioning

158
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,690
systems the other type of gun is not

159
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,400
that common it basically just shoots an

160
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,610
app but this is the most common type and

161
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,470
it basically has the following

162
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,970
components something to work the GPS you

163
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,520
can get an SDR

164
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,770
either a cheap one like the new ellic

165
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,410
which actually reaches a little bit

166
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,170
above what you need for the GPS so that

167
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,990
should work if not the hack RF should be

168
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,680
all that you need the these devices

169
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
would allow you to not also Jam the

170
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,620
signal but also spoof the signal but in

171
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,660
many cases if you you manage to

172
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,490
interrupt the GPS communication in a

173
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,860
drone you will force it to land on the

174
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,070
location where it is so maybe just a GPS

175
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,400
jammer which a lot for legal reasons a

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,050
lot of people are selling them a CPS

177
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,890
signal generators and those are super

178
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:36,380
cheap so next for a lot of drones use

179
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,730
just regular Wi-Fi to communicate so

180
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,230
many of you might might already know

181
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,130
that there's a bunch of different

182
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,050
options for that depending on the type

183
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,360
of antenna it's recommended to choose if

184
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,310
you signed it and the drone gun and it

185
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,400
was basically a yagi antenna like the

186
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,770
bottom-left one that you see there that

187
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,410
is basically what he uses a directional

188
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,830
antenna to jam the signal you can get a

189
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,260
cheaper one like the Alpha panel antenna

190
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,200
or you can there's people that have even

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,480
done I can't end up basically using a

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,790
can to create a

193
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,590
directional antenna in one of the

194
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,320
references you're gonna see project that

195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
basically uses exactly that to take them

196
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,540
wrong and for the transmitter course you

197
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,120
just get Wi-Fi card or again you can

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,470
actually also use the high RF and

199
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,960
finally for video again the hike RF or L

200
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,970
basically you can just get a powerful

201
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,050
fpv via video transmitter and make it

202
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,850
pop through the different channels and

203
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,710
there's also super expensive five

204
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,570
pointing in Hertz jammers that you can

205
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,590
get and all of this devices

206
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,700
basically are the different components

207
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,140
that you would see in an actual Turanga

208
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,300
that jammer on the bottom right has

209
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,780
actually been used in prisons because

210
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,640
people have used drones to try to carry

211
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,140
smuggle stuff into the prisons and have

212
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,820
been using drones in order to do that

213
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,740
now let's talk about hacking a drone

214
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,540
with another drone basically from the

215
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,190
different products that I showed you the

216
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,440
components that would make a drone gun

217
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,510
are pretty much the same components that

218
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,530
you can put on top of a drone and just

219
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,280
hack away other terms with just that it

220
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,070
would be pretty well not pretty cheap

221
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,560
but it would rather you would be rather

222
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,390
accessible a lot of this thing start

223
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,030
open source and you're gonna see later

224
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,820
on we're gonna talk a little bit about

225
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,610
commercial drones versus di drones and

226
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,710
of course a di drone the one that you

227
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,540
make yourself with open-source parts is

228
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,540
gonna be super easy to customize you'll

229
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,820
be able to add a bunch of different

230
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,600
sensors and components but of course the

231
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,880
constitute ID will be that is super

232
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,320
time-consuming and a lot of lamotte's

233
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,660
require some advanced knowledge and

234
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,670
because if there's many different

235
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,210
options in both open source software and

236
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,480
hardware you might find a tutorial or

237
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,890
some someone did a little bit of

238
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,210
research on something but it doesn't

239
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,570
quite apply to the particularly

240
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,030
than you have so going the DDI way it's

241
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,820
going to be he's going to give you a lot

242
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,980
of opportunities but at the same time

243
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,610
you're gonna be fixing and doing a bunch

244
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,260
of fidgeting around trying to figure out

245
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,460
how to get it to the next step

246
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,600
on the other hand you can get a

247
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,620
commercial thrown a lot of them are

248
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,450
people have invested a lot of time with

249
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,040
them there's a particular drone the

250
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,060
parrot ar.drone 2.0 that one a lot of

251
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,610
people have done mods on it so for a

252
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,650
commercial the room is super easy to mod

253
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,930
and there's plenty of resources online

254
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,120
because a lot of people from have been

255
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,200
working on this particular model that

256
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,940
comes would be that they have a limited

257
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,610
amount of sensors basically this model

258
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,440
in particular doesn't come with a GPS

259
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,840
you can buy that one but that's

260
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,480
basically it and if you want to start

261
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,150
adding like more hiking elements like a

262
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,430
Raspberry Pi or something it has a

263
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,560
limited veil of carry weight versus

264
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,940
doing your own throwing you place if

265
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,480
you'd be able to make it carry whatever

266
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,250
this one will we be able to carry like a

267
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,900
small Raspberry Pi in a battery and

268
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,330
that's it so there's also a bunch of

269
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,160
twosome projects for both attacking and

270
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,620
defending your drones now we're going to

271
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,000
talk about attacking out of the drones

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,850
and you're gonna see that for pirate and

273
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,440
DTI which are two of them major

274
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,900
commercial drone makers there's a lot of

275
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,260
tool to attack those two vendors so

276
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,430
Skyjack it's a very common project when

277
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,980
you basically do Google drone hacking

278
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,810
and this is one of the first thing that

279
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,210
is gonna come out he uses the drone that

280
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,690
I just show you to hack other drones

281
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,900
just like it and try to remote control

282
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,330
them and there's a bunch of other

283
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,910
projects similar to that one but try to

284
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,740
do the same thing so you're gonna find a

285
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,910
bunch of information out there for DJI

286
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,760
leaders also a bunch of

287
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,020
raishin out there there's a lot of

288
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,320
people doing reverse engineering so

289
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,350
you'll be able to get into a lot of the

290
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,000
commercial drones in a way that wouldn't

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,210
be normally possible compared to a DI

292
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,000
drone in which everything is open-source

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
we're gonna see a little bit more about

294
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,670
that next but there's also generic

295
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,150
attacks we ether is for example I texted

296
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,550
DSM X protocol which is the common

297
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,100
protocol that you were are gonna find in

298
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,060
remote remote controllers transmitters

299
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,810
everything that you used to actually

300
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,510
control the drone other than Wi-Fi the

301
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,000
you so the use very similar frequency is

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,470
not exactly the same but they have a

303
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,060
different protocols that would use

304
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,050
different motivation but in particular

305
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,500
because the DSM X protocol is the most

306
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,560
common one you'll be able to find what

307
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
you normally feel like a breakout board

308
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,100
that you can hook up to your Raspberry

309
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,890
Pi you just do the same thing I touch it

310
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,160
to the drone be able to hack other

311
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,110
drones that uses this very common

312
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,650
protocol and of course we were talking

313
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,480
about GPS jamming but also we mentioned

314
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,440
GPS proofing which is something that has

315
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,310
been used in order to try to make the

316
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,860
drone travel in a different direction

317
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,100
try to make it force where it is stuff

318
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:12,770
like that now for hardening drones and

319
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,290
this is where we split it a little bit

320
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,930
because it will be very different from

321
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,530
commercial and open source drones of

322
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,600
course the Dei open-source path will be

323
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,760
easier to modify you can just get an

324
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,040
actual radio controller that you can

325
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,590
flash the firmware with open source

326
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,680
software same from the flight controller

327
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,290
the receiver everything else so all of

328
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,170
that you'll be able to manipulate freely

329
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,110
versus a commercial drones which like we

330
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,140
already mentioned there's limited

331
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,330
options on what you can do for some

332
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,150
models all

333
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,650
people have been working on them and

334
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,150
they have shared what they have been

335
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,400
working on for other other models you

336
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,840
won't be able to find much information

337
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,030
but in general and in both cases you're

338
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,620
gonna have limited options that don't

339
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,670
include hardware marks that is modifying

340
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,040
somewhat something in the drone itself

341
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,680
if for many cases won't be just plug and

342
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,170
play now for commercial drones like I

343
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,760
said there's not much that you can do

344
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,470
basically just keeping the firmware

345
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,200
updated as you saw for DJI and parent

346
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,930
there's a lot of hacks going out so the

347
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,120
vendors are actually trying to get on

348
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,770
top of things updating their framework

349
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,570
protecting from these vulnerabilities

350
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,830
and making the files available for the

351
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,860
customers to download and reflash the

352
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,770
firmware they don't they don't seem to

353
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,860
have any type of auto update feature

354
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,000
which would be nice but in many cases

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,330
they'll just be able to do put the image

356
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,250
in as they've done on the SD card and

357
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,090
just turn on the drone annual update on

358
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,390
itself now as we saw a lot of them come

359
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,150
with Wi-Fi either to just share video to

360
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,760
change configurations so actually fly it

361
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,400
entirely stuff like that and in a lot of

362
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,800
cases they don't come with Wi-Fi

363
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,349
encryption enabled so if there's an

364
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,420
option if it comes with an app that lets

365
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,480
you modify that you should try to add a

366
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,359
password make it encrypted make you

367
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,349
secure and you can also in some models

368
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,940
disable pairing with more than one

369
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,650
device at a time would be a great idea

370
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,430
so somebody else won't be able to try to

371
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,580
wiggle you away it was joke they just

372
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,800
won't be able to connect if you change

373
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,170
that setting and I believe you was at

374
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,920
yeah

375
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,080
available in GGI that you can put the

376
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,670
amount of people that kind of connect it

377
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,060
to drum and yeah you can modify it in a

378
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,540
way that only you'll be able to connect

379
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,550
now for the commercial drones like we

380
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,460
said if you connect over Wi-Fi there's

381
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,230
gonna be a couple of services enabled

382
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,810
you're gonna have FTP

383
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,740
to share the videos whatever was

384
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,390
recorded by the drone you can download

385
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,400
it download it over Wi-Fi through web

386
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,330
FTP and you're gonna have telnet

387
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,090
now if telnet is enabled and a lot of

388
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,800
cases you'll be able to connect without

389
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,750
credentials some cases you're gonna get

390
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,730
a limited account in other cases you're

391
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,560
gonna get good and you'll be able to

392
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,000
modify the subsystem that it has it

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,410
actually is just visible so you'll be

394
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,620
able to just modify whatever you need in

395
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,930
order to make it safer just make sure

396
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,330
that you have a backup of the drones

397
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,990
firm work just in case you make any

398
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,750
mistakes you'll be able to recover it

399
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,110
now because of this attack this type of

400
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,870
attacks people had already identified

401
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,250
that element was vulnerable

402
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,810
so some vendors decided to add a

403
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,980
password in order to try to protect what

404
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,860
you were able to do if you were in that

405
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,670
Wi-Fi be a drones Wi-Fi but a lot of

406
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,310
them have a smartphone app that you can

407
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,920
download you open it up and you can

408
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,930
change the settings and it never really

409
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,620
asked you for any type of credentials so

410
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,480
the thing is that for a lot of vendors

411
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,970
they use the same credentials for all

412
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,700
drones even CGI did it and a lot of the

413
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,040
smaller vendors also do it so what you

414
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,710
can do is just connect to the Wi-Fi open

415
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,310
up the smartphone app and sniff the

416
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,500
communication when you connect to the

417
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,050
drone using wireshark and you're gonna

418
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,440
see the credentials just flying through

419
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,600
and you can use that same credentials to

420
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,380
log in to tell I didn't the drone and to

421
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,850
what it just suggested you can modify

422
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,670
that be able to harden the drones is

423
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,600
like basically any other gaming system

424
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,620
again just make sure that you have a

425
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,340
backup for it

426
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,309
now 40 nitrones there's of course a lot

427
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,350
more options you'll be able to just add

428
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,470
whatever you need to add and modify the

429
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,850
source code in whichever way you need to

430
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,919
modify it now of course there's a couple

431
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,559
of things that you have to do there just

432
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,029
like for our commercial drones that is

433
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,289
disabled pairing with more than one

434
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:35,929
device at a time and keep hearing more

435
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:38,870
unrelated software updated basically

436
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,970
those two just like for commercial

437
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,380
drones you need to keep everything

438
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,809
updated but of course you have the

439
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,880
option to modify the source code the

440
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,730
source code as needed

441
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,960
that means that you'll be able to play

442
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,690
around change settings test how it goes

443
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,779
if it doesn't work you just download a

444
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,059
recruiting software again there's a lot

445
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,120
more that you can do and you can add

446
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,760
more flight sensors so as we saw there's

447
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,200
a bunch of different type of attacks

448
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,669
that basically are limited

449
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,890
the most common attacks are limited just

450
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,090
TPS which is used for the altitude and

451
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,080
fixed position now for both altitude and

452
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,809
fixed positions there are other sensors

453
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:26,330
that you can add that will complement

454
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,390
what the TPS to see so if the TPS goes

455
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,909
out you still have other sensors that

456
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,559
can be used in order to determine a

457
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,230
thickness of my position this is my

458
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,320
altitude so it doesn't really relate

459
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,890
jazz with GPS in order to do that for

460
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,820
the out leaders we saw that laser maybe

461
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,279
it's not such a good idea basically you

462
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,880
put a small laser rangefinder on the

463
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,649
bottom of the drone and it uses that to

464
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,390
determine the altitude but people have a

465
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,289
theory that the drone that we saw that

466
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,090
protesters take down was because it

467
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,179
probably had a laser sensor on the

468
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,870
bottom but ultrasonic makes with

469
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,690
barometric sensors would actually be a

470
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,279
great idea for a drone because

471
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,460
ultrasonic has a shorter range and the

472
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,470
barometric does

473
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,049
really work great on short arranged by

474
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,900
the words rate on larger ranges so using

475
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,740
those two will be a great way to

476
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,600
complement the GPS in order to try to

477
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
determine part of the position that it

478
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
needs and for the fixed position very

479
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,880
common our solution is called optical

480
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,470
flow tracking which is basically just

481
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,490
putting a camera taking as a picture of

482
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,470
where the camera sees and then taking a

483
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,590
picture just in a very short time for

484
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,260
that time frame and comparing the images

485
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,789
and seeing if they had thrown is

486
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,010
drifting in any particular direction and

487
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,039
try to correct it in theory there are

488
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,549
attacks against this type of this type

489
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,770
of sensors in in one case in particular

490
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,490
for example the power ar.drone that we

491
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,860
talked about earlier that one uses that

492
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,530
to try to get a fixed position if you

493
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,409
don't have a GPS module and some people

494
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,419
found out that if you point out a really

495
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:27,309
bright laser on the floor apparently the

496
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,940
drone use it that laser to try to fix it

497
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,429
that's that's the fixed position so it's

498
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,140
gonna use that door you leave it like

499
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,850
really you try not to move the laser

500
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,549
took right V of the drum the drum uses

501
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,860
that dark to the terminal ki this is

502
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,169
what I'm gonna use so i don't drift away

503
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,630
and then you start slowly moving the

504
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,289
laser and the drum will follow it of

505
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,809
course if you have an open source

506
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,240
solution modifying the code so it

507
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,169
doesn't relax just one point would be a

508
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,860
good approach and there's actually some

509
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,990
richard the research done on it that

510
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,380
you're gonna see also into references

511
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,320
now for backup and recovery channels

512
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,650
that is other types of communication are

513
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,200
actually used to control the drone what

514
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,380
happen if you lose connection on one of

515
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,510
those well one of the elements that we

516
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,970
that I commonly saw when I was doing the

517
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,770
search was people just using a cellphone

518
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,659
in order to communicate with it actually

519
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:43,480
you can just buy GSM or or 3G breakout

520
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,640
board you could a semper you connected

521
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,500
to our Raspberry Pi to an Arduino or

522
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
whatever and a lot of people were using

523
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,169
it as a recovery method but is you lost

524
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,870
your drum you can basically just send a

525
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,850
text and it will reply back without GPS

526
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,870
location or actually using it to control

527
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,150
it because it's not as fast that you

528
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,850
just using an actual transmitter remote

529
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,419
controller but because the drone if if

530
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,370
it already has a bunch of sensors like

531
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,909
GPS and it has barometric pressure

532
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:18,340
sensor and optical flow tracking it

533
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,020
probably doesn't need to rely on

534
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,710
immediate controls right away so that

535
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,700
was probably a partial option but a most

536
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,640
common option or actually not more

537
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,429
common but definitely sounds like a

538
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:36,280
better idea would be you use just

539
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,630
another method of communication Laura

540
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,900
which stands for low long range is

541
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,179
actually a very tiny device like the one

542
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,990
you see on the right is the one with the

543
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:55,539
antenna and it uses very little energy

544
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:01,090
which is perfect for a drone he has long

545
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,820
range I mean it was designed with that

546
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,340
objective and that's how I got the name

547
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,010
and you can see that the model is

548
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,140
actually super tiny so using that as a

549
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,330
main communication channel would be a

550
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,860
viable option doesn't have transfer

551
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,570
rates that would allow you to send video

552
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,400
or stuff like that but at least part of

553
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,510
the remote control it would be

554
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,549
definitely enough it's a way lower

555
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:32,770
frequency than they come on 2.7

556
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,020
gigahertz that actually means that it's

557
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,909
gonna have better it's gonna have as it

558
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:43,200
is a longer wavelength will be easier

559
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,909
to go through walls and stuff like that

560
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,269
unlike Wi-Fi so it should periodically

561
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:51,840
have a lot better reception in in areas

562
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,360
which in which you have a lot of

563
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,070
constructions and stuff like that a lot

564
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,169
of buildings so that would be a better

565
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,380
alternative and none of the drum guns

566
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,230
that you're gonna see on the market aim

567
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,990
for this kind of frequency devices so

568
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,460
that would be just one of the many

569
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,960
options that you have to use either

570
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,029
backup recovery channels or actually a

571
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,710
device like that aside to pass your main

572
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,210
communication channel now for a video as

573
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,970
you may know basically a drone will have

574
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,549
a video transmitter you'll be able to

575
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,039
choose a channel and then the receiver

576
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,289
you do the same you select the channel

577
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,240
and it's gonna see the image but it

578
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,010
doesn't have any type of encryption any

579
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,090
type of security basically even people

580
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,130
so drones normally uses in frequencies

581
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,190
as baby monitors so anybody that has a

582
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,010
baby monitor receiver will be able to

583
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,019
see what your drone sees if you're not

584
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,750
using some type of encoder I saw a

585
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,590
vendor that sells they once on the

586
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,440
bottom Center

587
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,659
they call it scramblers but don't

588
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,490
actually work as comp a scramblers

589
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,639
apparently they're just encoders but

590
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:08,100
adding that so on one end you added in

591
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,159
between the camera and the transmitter

592
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,049
and the other one you put it in between

593
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,830
the receiver and the screen in which you

594
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,130
see the video feed and that will mean

595
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,750
that anybody who tries to read the

596
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,889
communication on the air will see just

597
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,980
garbage on the screen instead of what

598
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:35,909
the drone is actually seeing and a

599
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:39,690
little summary on the references I put

600
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,000
the three top videos at the top so you

601
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,649
have an idea of what people have been

602
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:46,649
doing with ronson one why there's a lot

603
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:49,470
of other people worried about drones and

604
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,710
investing in drone security the

605
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,440
fireworks drone there's the Instagram

606
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,630
link for

607
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,030
yeah uh you cut out just a little bit

608
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,590
there can you stutter start over on this

609
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,370
slide please

610
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,209
yeah of course

611
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,049
so a bit of a summary on the references

612
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,870
I put the three first links are

613
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,720
basically the several different reasons

614
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,130
why people have been getting worried

615
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,929
about drums to stop the husband going

616
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,380
out we didn't talk about other more

617
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,440
worrisome stuff I don't know if anybody

618
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,059
knows that drones have already been in

619
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,700
commercial drones just like the DGI have

620
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,150
been used to drop bombs and stuff like

621
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,860
that so there's a lot of reasons why

622
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,870
people are getting worried there's a lot

623
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,970
of people that claim that this video is

624
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,740
like the firework is thrown or the airs

625
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,559
of thrown a really cool ideas and I

626
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,330
actually in a way I agreed I think

627
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,590
they're cool ideas but they're easy to

628
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,549
take in the wrong direction and then

629
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:00,900
there's a lot of links on the bottom

630
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,600
that I just put them all together that's

631
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,820
basically a lot of different projects

632
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,640
articles a lot of extra information some

633
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,590
of it that you saw on the presentation

634
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,900
regarding drone hiking defending from

635
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,660
other drones how to do certain attacks

636
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,880
like the GPS spoofing attacks and other

637
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,270
similar elements that you'll be able to

638
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,340
see either projects that you can use to

639
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,380
yourself or ideas that you can follow

640
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,309
there's an article about people that

641
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,549
modify their troubles and which are

642
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,970
better to be modified so I hope that you

643
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,470
get some extra information from those

644
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,850
things and that will be it if you have

645
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,309
any questions now be the perfect moment

646
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,299
ever you have a question if you wanted

647
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,340
to get started on flying drones outdoor

648
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,350
which one would you buy for outdoors

649
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,220
I would buy basically any GPS assistant

650
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,020
room those will be the easiest if again

651
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,520
if you're flying outdoors if you're

652
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,230
flying indoors there's a lot of them

653
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,770
that have like special protection around

654
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,320
the props or sensors to avoid collision

655
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,909
but if you're flying outside and you

656
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,279
have the ability to use GPS that's

657
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,049
probably gonna be the easiest and the

658
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:39,830
cheapest option in many cases you can

659
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,760
get a drone super cheap like I just got

660
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,669
one for 140 dollars and it has a bunch

661
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:53,120
of GPS functions it has assisted takeoff

662
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,360
on landing it can follow you around

663
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,700
you can send waypoints on on a map and

664
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,750
it will follow those stuff like that so

665
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,270
for outdoor flying you can get a super

666
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,570
cheap drum that has basically GPS SSS

667
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,279
flying or just any of the fancy GPS are

668
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,520
options that I just mentioned and if you

669
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,830
want to take it a step further you can

670
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,000
check that they have additional sensors

671
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,299
so you'll be able to make sure like I

672
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,669
just said a lot of them are gonna have a

673
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:34,279
camera or a laser underneath that it

674
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,039
used for assisted takeoff or landing or

675
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,940
to try to avoid drifting when when

676
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,630
you're flying with strong airs strong

677
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,770
winds so any of those options you can

678
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,789
get it for 200-300 if you look for you

679
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:56,380
can just go to Amazon look around the

680
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,480
$200 range and all of them are gonna

681
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,630
have the options I just mentioned of

682
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,140
course you can always invest a little

683
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,970
bit more and go with one of the major

684
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,260
vendors but

685
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,330
they're basically gonna have pretty much

686
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,450
the same functions maybe a couple more

687
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,280
DG I implemented something that is

688
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,990
really cool which is called geofencing

689
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,190
and what it does is the drone already

690
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,290
knows where it's not supposed to fly

691
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,110
like into an airport or something so you

692
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,570
won't be able to accidentally drift off

693
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,630
into the location so that basically

694
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,679
takes a huge headache away you don't

695
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,270
have to worry so much about what if I'm

696
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,240
flying in in an area if I shouldn't well

697
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,820
as long as it's not private property the

698
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,530
drone through geofencing will not go

699
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,410
into anything that it's well more

700
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,059
dangerous or private property so

701
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,280
basically you only need to now fly above

702
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,400
other people and then the drone will

703
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,410
take care about not accidentally getting

704
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,090
into an airport or whatever but anything

705
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,369
within that range will work wonders for

706
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,280
what you want to do just fine outdoors

707
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,719
and a question for you hello yeah oh

708
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,010
yeah what are the major protocols used

709
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,889
in the drone or you have mentioned like

710
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,409
a GPS and other kind of thing

711
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,129
are there any other customer support

712
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:39,629
also key supporting for the based on the

713
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,960
channels level and also the what kind of

714
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,210
a frequency majority of the drones are

715
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:52,100
using let me go back a bit so if you see

716
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,420
one of the last third to the last one so

717
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
he said at the end he carries is the one

718
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,200
that attacks the dsm x protocol which is

719
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,390
the most common protocol that works on

720
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:11,340
2.4 gigahertz so Dalton the two options

721
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,109
that you have if you want to attack this

722
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,840
type of protocols you won't be able to

723
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,270
use a Wi-Fi card a regular Wi-Fi card is

724
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,859
basically the whole protocol they all

725
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:20,450
mostly

726
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,020
is different but you can use either the

727
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,280
hack RF SDR which will allow you to tune

728
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,099
into this frequency and then is if you

729
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:34,250
demodulate everything that the DSM X

730
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,450
protocol is sending or since that

731
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,520
particular protocol is the most common

732
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,190
one you'll be able to find hardware that

733
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,930
you can hook up to an Arduino or

734
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,240
Raspberry Pi or any other microcomputer

735
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,630
and you can program it to do whatever it

736
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,800
is that you want

737
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,040
it could be normally they use our key

738
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,440
pairs so that you won't be able to

739
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,810
inject your own code but those key pairs

740
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,320
are based are super easy route force so

741
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,130
if you see in the references about eco

742
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,800
rules there's a paper that it's not

743
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,450
actually a paper it's just an article it

744
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,310
tooks a little bit about how they came

745
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,650
about hacking that particular protocol

746
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,339
but other transmitters might use any of

747
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:21,020
the other protocols that you see down

748
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:28,010
there like DSM - m-link FHSS and any of

749
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,950
the other ones so you're gonna have

750
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,380
different options but at least the SMX

751
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,750
is the most common one so it should be

752
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:42,619
the easiest one to target I have another

753
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:46,160
question Henry there is a lot of if you

754
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,060
go googling for people that wants to get

755
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,589
started on this there's a bunch of

756
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:56,000
courses in the range of $1,300 and then

757
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,950
they claim that they certify you as a

758
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,579
pilot and a bunch of other styles is

759
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,530
that worth it or not what's your what's

760
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,690
your opinion on that so particular for

761
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,760
the US there's a couple of things that

762
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,109
will become important or an issue right

763
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,750
now you don't actually need a pilot

764
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:24,440
license of fly but the FCC and the FAA

765
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,240
so basically everything regarding

766
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,530
wireless transmissions and everything

767
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,890
regarding

768
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,610
flying objects is getting heavily

769
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,480
regulated so at the very least right now

770
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,180
you do need a pilot license for certain

771
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,330
cases for example if you're gonna fly

772
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,340
about people like in a big event and you

773
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,170
want to record that event you do need a

774
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,700
pilot license for that but definitely

775
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,760
seems like they're trying to regulate

776
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,190
this a lot more it could happen that

777
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:05,020
eventually everybody will need a pilot

778
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,650
license for basically any type of flying

779
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,110
but so right now you don't actually need

780
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,220
it

781
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,490
I have heard very good reviews and a

782
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,560
couple of basically these pilot classes

783
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,990
so I think they might be worth it but I

784
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,940
haven't tried it myself and I haven't

785
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,070
done the research and have to actually

786
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,310
recommend anything in particular but I

787
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,530
definitely can say that I've heard a lot

788
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,570
of good things about them but it's

789
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,580
awesome right now it's not strictly

790
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,500
necessary but it's worth paying for it

791
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,210
it seems that it is I've heard from a

792
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,190
lot of people that it seems that it is

793
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,930
so if you want I can ask them in

794
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,000
particular which one they recommend and

795
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,530
they can share the least who's like

796
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,650
thank you

797
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,090
and yeah yeah yeah one last question

798
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,350
actually are you will you share these

799
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,840
are PPD's to all respect to you means

800
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,270
how it is yeah I can share it what

801
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,460
whichever way you prefer normally what I

802
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,820
do is just find whatever free

803
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,620
file-sharing service there is I upload

804
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,400
it and then put the link on slug Oh

805
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,060
shush shush

806
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:46,359
perfect any other questions um I do see

807
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,829
one in the slack Channel somebody asked

808
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,869
I think Mac asked which drone did you

809
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:58,390
buy for 140 bucks that has GPS oh let me

810
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,790
see if I can find the link but it's

811
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,240
called the brand the maker is called

812
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,670
snap time nap time okay up time like

813
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,799
captain but it's not on the front uh-huh

814
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:18,930
and emanate can remember the model sorry

815
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,210
when you track it down we can throw it

816
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,990
into black if you want the answer max

817
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:31,558
question perfect kick slack

818
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,099
all right any other questions for Henry

819
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,799
Rob did you want to circle back

820
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:45,630
