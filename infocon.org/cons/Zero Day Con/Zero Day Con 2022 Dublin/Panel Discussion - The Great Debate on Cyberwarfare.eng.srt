1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,359
okay ladies and gentlemen you're very

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,440
welcome back after lunch uh thanks so

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
much for staying with us good numbers

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,160
it's good to see and there's loads of

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,360
people are going to the other room as

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
well isn't it nice to have someone else

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,560
make lunch for you

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
it's the kind of thing that we've just

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
lost in the last two years well we have

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
another boring sandwich or tiny little

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,960
burgers that have been made by somebody

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
else says it's just nice to be back so

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
thanks to the ccd uh for looking after

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,480
us there over the last little while

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
we've got three great panels in this

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,840
room um and we're going to be talking uh

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,000
about cyber security and we're going to

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
talk about zero trust and we're going to

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,160
talk about collective intelligence uh

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,440
which i'd like to think we have in the

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
room today but our panel is going to

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,760
draw on that a little bit later as you

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,239
may very well know there is a parallel

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,719
uh technical ai technical discussion

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
that's happening in liffey too so if

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
you're into ml ops and automation uh if

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,680
you're into security design in the cloud

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,280
feature store operations that get

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
visibility are lessons learned from

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,879
applying ai to it data then you're in

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,520
the wrong room uh but if you want to go

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
and listen to that that's in the room in

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
liffey too but everyone else if you can

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,159
uh

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,760
take part in this conversation so we're

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
gonna have a chat on stage and then

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
we're going to hopefully bring people in

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
from the room now the way it's going to

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,439
work uh still because of the cameras not

40
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040
because it covered with two microphones

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
set up here so if you have a question

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
i'm going to have to ask you to come to

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
the microphone or else shout really

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,000
loudly at me i i i will respond to both

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
uh but for the first panel discussion

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
will you please welcome to the stage for

47
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
the great debate on cyber security uh

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
we've got brian johnson the head of i.t

49

now it is lovely to see uh thank you

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
very much for joining us um

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
i i'm going to begin down the end with

66
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,399
you brian if i can um because like we

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
have an irish conversation about what we

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
know what we think we know and what we

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,720
understand but from your perspective

70
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
where are we at with cyber security

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
globally right now amid everything

72
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,360
that's going on

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,879
i think uh

74
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,720
where we at from a defensive standpoint

75
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
or the threats the threats to begin with

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,520
wow

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
the threats are definitely a challenge

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
and one of the areas that

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
that i

80
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
my background is military intelligence

81
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,360
with the army us army and

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
for me

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
looking at collateral damage is really

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
important for me

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
because in my background when you're

86
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
planning an attack or you're preparing

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
to defend it against attack you have to

88
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,599
go through sort of a bunch of planning

89
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
factors and collateral damage is a big

90
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
one and so

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
where i

92
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,920
where i see

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,519
cyber security is

94
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
in cyber warfare collateral damage is

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,440
much different so in a conventional

96
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
fight you're going to be planning

97
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
against targets you're going to be

98
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,440
planning munition types you're going to

99
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
be planting weapons systems

100
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
um and in cyber warfare you're going to

101
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
be looking at you know target ranges of

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,599
networks systems you're going to be

103
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
looking at vulnerabilities how many

104
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
systems are affected by those

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
vulnerabilities you're going to be

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
talking about

107
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
what are the defensive capabilities or

108
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,799
what are the controls in place at that

109
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
organization that has the target system

110
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,599
you're looking at

111
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
and all of those factors

112
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
we have a role like everyone in this

113
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
room

114
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,040
is probably there's a few exceptions i

115
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
think but they're probably not in charge

116
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
of conducting cyber attacks on nation

117
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
states well we'd like to think not we

118
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,680
like this

119
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,959
i mean some of them look a bit dodgy but

120
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,480
i don't think that dodgy

121
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
but we all have a role in how do we

122
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
limit that collateral damage

123
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,840
um luke if i can turn to you um when we

124
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
think of cybersecurity traditionally the

125
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,239
the the csos in the room would have been

126
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,879
focused on criminal activity uh people

127
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,760
who are trying to effectively rob you

128
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
okay which would be something that you

129
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
did bring the likes of pat lord in or

130
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
are you guys for support in the states

131
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
how worried are we now more about nation

132
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,239
state attacks and the idea of guerrilla

133
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,439
warfare being waged by

134
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
state actors as opposed to criminal

135
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,399
actors

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
yeah very good

137
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,680
uh discussion point um so

138
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
when we talk about cyber warfare there's

139
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
you know traditionally you're supposed

140
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
to know who hits you

141
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
in any type of attack kinetic attack

142
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
you're going to have a bomb that comes

143
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
from a plane that hits a area and you

144
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
know that plane is from x country uh or

145
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,000
it's going to be x militia or x grill in

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
cyber

147
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
warfare it's a little you got a little

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
bit an anonymity now

149
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
when you're talking about guerrilla

150
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,840
warfare and what you have to worry about

151
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,800
is

152
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,199
you might have one person saying that it

153
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
was me but in reality it could be

154
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
somebody else or there's going to be

155
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
nobody saying anything at all and that's

156
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
where the fear comes in because if you

157
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,639
don't have that

158
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,840
connection

159
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
then you don't know who to go to if it's

160
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
an incident that they wanted to do to

161
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
maximize because

162
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
do you tell law enforcement or do you

163
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
tell the counterintelligence expert do

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
you go to this area and here's the

165
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,280
information no you just have the

166
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,199
remnants left

167
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
um so really talking about guerrilla

168
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
warfare with multiple countries multiple

169
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,639
jurisdictions multiple areas of law it

170
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
gets very difficult to now engage with

171
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
the nation that might have had the

172
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
activity coming from there i mean it's

173
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
almost advantage bad guys isn't it that

174
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
that they have it set up in such a way

175
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
that that fear factor which we were

176
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
talking about earlier prevents reporting

177
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
prevents people from bringing in the

178
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
official authorities who can start a

179
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
proper investigation or at least who can

180
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
give you some level of support that

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
might go above and beyond what you'd

182
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,520
normally get off the shelf that's right

183
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
especially if you have a ddos you're

184
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
going to get bots everywhere and they're

185
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,639
going to come in from all locations

186
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,319
unless you take the bot down or identify

187
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
who's controlling the bot server client

188
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,520
then it gets a little a little bit

189
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,560
harder but

190
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
you got to have the companies really

191
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
engaging with the law enforcement with

192
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
the government country because if you

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
don't we don't have any of that

194
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,319
information to go and follow up donna we

195
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,319
know that attacks are under reported

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
okay um we had a big one last year that

197
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,800
everybody was aware of and it really it

198
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,720
served purpose actually to heighten

199
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
awareness about everybody about you know

200
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,160
their own personal responsibilities but

201
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
for organizations even within

202
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
organizations

203
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
there can be under reporting because

204
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
people don't want to admit whoops i did

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
that and and that again gives an

206
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
advantage to the individuals who are

207
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,639
attacking

208
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
no absolutely and it is as it's that

209
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
fear factor

210
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
and

211
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
it's you know the cyber space there's

212
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
this there's this um you know the norms

213
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
are cooperation and restraint but it's

214
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
the law of the jungle

215
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,319
and we need to i think increase the the

216
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,039
price of the bad behavior um you know

217
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
this is you know cyber warfare at what

218
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,840
point

219
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,680
um do we determine that what has

220
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
happened i mean arguably with the hsc

221
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
you could

222
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
possibly say that that is warfare there

223
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,199
were civilians impacted

224
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,720
by that attack um and there's huge

225
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
reputational damage there's huge amount

226
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,599
of money to be invested into

227
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,360
upgrading systems now and making sure

228
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
that the networks are hardened and that

229
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
they're prepared and that we can see

230
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
around the corner but how can we see

231
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
around the corner and how can we prepare

232
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,639
and i think organizations

233
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,919
have to

234
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
um be transparent

235
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,120
report what's happening that's the only

236
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
way we're going to be able to learn and

237
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,520
grow and develop and get ready to

238
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,199
retaliate or defend ourselves not

239
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,080
retaliate of course but defend ourselves

240
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
if and when there was an attack because

241
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
there was a sense from people in other

242
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,599
sectors and other organizations when the

243
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
hse thing happened there but for the

244
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
grace of god go away it could have

245
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,039
happened to any of us and you know it

246
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,560
i'm presuming even in the prison service

247
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,759
where you normally lock people up for

248
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
this kind of thing you do you double

249
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
down on your security and you you ran

250
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
the rule over well this is it and this

251
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
is where you mentioned collateral damage

252
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
you know we're a critical infrastructure

253
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,479
for the state um and

254
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,120
um public safety and we're really good

255
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
at physical infrastructure and keeping

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
the bad guys in but now we have to work

257
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,599
on keeping bad guys out of our

258
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,080
cyberspace and it's the

259
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
collateral damage of other networks

260
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,000
being impacted and we need to share this

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
information we need to come together and

262
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
work strategically as partners together

263
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
to understand

264
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,559
how we may be impacted and what the

265
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,479
long-term impact of this damage is to

266
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,760
our systems because

267
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
we naturally had to respond as well we

268
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
do have a healthcare service within you

269
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
know in in the prisons it's like a

270
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
community behind walls

271
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
and we have we nearly mirror a lot of

272
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,080
the the services that are out in your

273
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,640
community yeah pat

274
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
talk about warfare the theory is it's a

275
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,640
soldier fighting a soldier

276
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,760
here

277
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
it is a soldier attacking a civilian

278
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
it's trying to victimize an individual a

279
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
weak point in the link isn't it and it's

280
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,279
about making people aware of that

281
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
without scaring the living daylights out

282
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
of them yes absolutely it's it's trying

283
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,600
to raise the awareness and i suppose

284
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
behind it all the hse attack has helped

285
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
a lot of us in that regard in that

286
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
everybody from the youngest child the

287
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
oldest person amongst us has realized

288
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
now that this is a serious threat

289
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,279
because it's come to reality because you

290
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,800
couldn't go and get your appointment you

291
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
couldn't go and get your operation done

292
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
and it was and still is affecting the

293
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
hse so i think it's it's been an

294
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,839
important learning for a lot of entities

295
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,120
we have never had so many requests for

296
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,080
webinars and talks even in the virtual

297
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
world i think this week alone i'm

298
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,920
involved in three different events this

299
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
is the best one though isn't it

300
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
yeah well actually no

301
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
yesterday's one

302
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
yesterday's one with the international

303
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
police women's association in dublin

304
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
castle was really interesting i'm only

305
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,160
joking this is but i was

306
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,839
in the midst of a lot of police forces

307
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,279
from around europe the us canada

308
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,440
and they're all in the same boat as we

309
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
are they're all looking at their cyber

310
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
security capability even within their

311
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
own entities so forget about

312
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
investigating it they have to look at

313
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
what they're doing themselves and our

314
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,279
own ids the same as donors would have

315
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,480
been looking at all of this over the

316
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
years

317
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,399
because it was the health service that

318
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,760
was attacked and i know we focused on

319
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,480
that

320
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
but it showed vulnerability that imagine

321
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
if that had happened with regards to

322
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
your corner and the information the

323
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
sensitive information that's clearly

324
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,079
stored by the guards

325
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
and it has happened for these forces

326
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,079
absolutely and it's happened us forces

327
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,760
and different people over the years and

328
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
we can't

329
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
one thing that was put up this morning

330
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
on the screen was i know now they're

331
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
gone and i had personal experience of

332
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,120
that about two years ago a company lost

333
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
one million euros they were just about

334
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
to lose another seven million euros in a

335
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
business email compromise and within two

336
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
hours i had a discussion with the ceo of

337
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,079
the company and their head of i.t and i

338
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,440
asked the question are you sure now

339
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
you've got rid of them are they gone

340
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
and the i.t person he's not here in the

341
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,040
audience i don't think said no no i'm

342
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
100 sure they're not there anymore

343
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
i'm not an expert on cyber but i can

344
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
sure as hell tell you that after one

345
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
hour and a half or two hours i don't

346
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,519
know how sure he could be that they've

347
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,279
gone out of the system

348
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,800
i wouldn't have been that confident that

349
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
they were but i think looking at the

350
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
under reporting for example i think the

351
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
more reporting we have the better

352
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
sometimes

353
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
it'll be reliant on the the private

354
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
sector and the experts to deal with the

355
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,279
problem but at least by reporting it to

356
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
law enforcement and we've heard it a few

357
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
times this morning here

358
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
you'll help law enforcement understand

359
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
it but you'll also help maybe the next

360
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,760
victim

361
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,279
because if we've solved the problem and

362
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,800
we had an example of that about three

363
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,959
years ago it was a very small attack on

364
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,000
a company

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
and working with a few agencies we were

366
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
able to solve the problem but four weeks

367
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,839
later there was a very serious attack on

368
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
a bigger company much bigger company but

369
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,120
it was the same group and it was much

370
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
easier to deal with yeah because you

371
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,639
have you have a bit of knowledge and and

372
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,120
i think the the other element i think is

373
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
we need to be ready for this because

374
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
despite what's going on in russia and

375
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
ukraine at the moment

376
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
this can happen any day of the week but

377
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
it probably escalates it because when

378
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
the war is going on that was described

379
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
this morning the criminals that are not

380
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,920
linked to russia or ukraine at all will

381
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,519
also be looking at us to know how we

382
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,880
weaknesses well they'll take advantage

383
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,920
absolutely they'll take advantage of

384
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,959
what there's a heightened state of

385
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,600
anxiety um brian i i don't know how much

386
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
you pay attention you actually paid to

387
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,040
the hse thing when it happened but you

388
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
know we did subsequently find out it was

389
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
a county attack we know when they were

390
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639
hacked last week that there was a

391
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,240
russian involvement in it so we got a

392
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
lot more information but there was a

393
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
discussion at the time about whether

394
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,000
they had actually meant to do what they

395
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,959
did

396
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,279
which was to shut down the entire

397
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
hse computer system and that was

398
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
disproportionate to whatever criminal

399
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,160
activity they had wanted to pursue the

400
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
issue of proportionality is really

401
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,600
really important and in cyber warfare

402
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,399
is it

403
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
easier to do a lot of damage with a

404
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
little activity and is it easier to

405
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
accidentally cause more damage than

406
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
perhaps the actor may have intended

407
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,120
absolutely the short answer is

408
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,200
absolutely um the

409
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
you know proportionality is is another

410
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
one of those planning factors for

411
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
warfare you know

412
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
conventional warfare typically you know

413
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
your proportionality is the response you

414
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,079
would give to an attack that took place

415
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,120
against you

416
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,519
and with with you know with conventional

417
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,839
warfare i think low kick you hit it uh

418
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,040
this morning a little bit i think you

419
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
talked about response and you were

420
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,839
showing the missile and hitting the

421
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,800
target and stuff um but with with cyber

422
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,279
warfare first of all

423
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,800
you know i think with the attack on the

424
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
hse if i remember correctly they were in

425
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
hse systems for eight weeks prior to the

426
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,519
attack happening yeah okay so that that

427
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
wasn't obviously that either wasn't

428
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,160
known or it wasn't reported um so with

429
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,560
with a proportional attack you

430
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,199
if you are hit uh or if whether it's an

431
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
accidental or an intentional one to

432
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
respond back

433
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,279
is very difficult because you may not

434
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,160
one know the pervasiveness of the attack

435
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,079
how many systems did it actually affect

436
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,240
how many hospitals actually went down or

437
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
you know you may not know until six

438
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
months after the fact that they were in

439
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
your systems conducting the attack

440
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,399
whether it's in this case you know for

441
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
the hsc ransomware and it locked down

442
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,800
the systems and and they were completely

443
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,199
inaccessible but in a case where it's

444
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
maybe a lesser form of warfare it may

445
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
not be noticeable right away so a

446
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,519
proportional response

447
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,240
is almost you know it's it's very very

448
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
difficult gets very complex very yeah

449
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,399
but

450
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
you know again let's just break it down

451
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
to black and white good guys versus bad

452
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
guys how did the good guys respond

453
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
proportionately to a disproportionate

454
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
attack

455
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,639
um

456
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,800
very very cleverly

457
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
but uh it is very challenging um knowing

458
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,279
your target

459
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
like i talked about the collateral

460
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,279
damage you do before you conduct an

461
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,480
attack

462
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,199
you hope that all that reconnaissance

463
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,519
has gone into it right and the care has

464
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
gone into it and i know we mentioned

465
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
this morning someone mentioned about uh

466
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,600
the russian attacks didn't hit anything

467
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
that had cyrillic language on the

468
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,399
keyboard okay so that's a very

469
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,240
weird proportional response right

470
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,360
because that means i'm going to attack

471
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
everyone else in the world um but it is

472
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
very difficult to get it right um and it

473
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,120
takes a lot of skill um

474
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,680
where whereas with traditional cyber

475
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,959
criminals

476
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,920
if i could put it that way the

477
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,079
motivation's money the motivation can

478
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,839
often be money

479
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
there is

480
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,959
a growing concern the motivation should

481
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,680
be fear that we can get you we can shut

482
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
you down we can we can disrupt you in

483
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,079
ways that you haven't thought about yet

484
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,639
and that fear is is a motivating factor

485
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
because when we live in a world of

486
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,639
social media where things are brought to

487
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,079
our attention very very quickly when

488
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,680
things go wrong

489
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,480
if

490
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
if there's a nefarious state actor that

491
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
attacks another state the news gets out

492
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
really quick often quicker

493
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,440
than anyone would possibly wanted to

494
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,399
hampering response so is it propaganda

495
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
is it fear i mean

496
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
it's a it's a very broad battlefield if

497
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
i could put it that way

498
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
it is um when we

499
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
fear and fear so i'll i'll give an

500
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,199
example of something that we all

501
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
probably know about is you get scam

502
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,680
calls

503
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
well we get a lot of that there is they

504
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
want to take your money i missed i

505
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,519
missed the african prince who offered to

506
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
use me millions yeah i i really did the

507
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,519
boring stuff about irish revenue yeah

508
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,720
there's a couple of princesses

509
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
princesses i saved uh and

510
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,839
there but the

511
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,839
was not fear right that was using your

512
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
emotion so it doesn't have to be

513
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
necessarily fear it can be any emotion

514
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,959
now fear is the greatest factor because

515
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,800
what are they going to do to me to lock

516
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,639
me out of my information

517
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
are they going to change it so i don't

518
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,319
know what happened

519
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,039
and the other one is will they take it

520
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,119
and you know and then the last one of

521
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,160
course is

522
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
melting down everything and making sure

523
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
it's not usable and you're just going to

524
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,679
have to start over from scratch

525
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,880
but

526
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,199
these these criminals

527
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
will use that

528
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,240
social media to let everybody know that

529
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,919
this can happen

530
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,520
and then when it happens it might not be

531
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
a big event it might be a small event

532
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
it might be a big event you won't even

533
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
know it but it's a small event look at

534
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
the countries that

535
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
have been impacted um in the past you

536
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
know it's about georgia you know you

537
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,520
talk about estonia estonia did some

538
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,400
great stuff there but

539
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
were those the precursors of what can

540
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,679
happen in a larger location well

541
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,200
those small things

542
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
that occurred in some of those countries

543
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
have now been mirrored by guerrilla

544
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
warfare or some somebody else

545
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
now the bigger countries are going the

546
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
next step

547
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,200
and is that a fear factor will i die

548
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
or will i lose information or will

549
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
something go get exposed on the internet

550
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,559
of me

551
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,320
yeah that's that's another fear factor

552
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,440
but

553
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,039
is it fear of

554
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
shaming fear of money is it

555
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
maybe it's the opposite maybe it's

556
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
happiness maybe i was going to do

557
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
something but i decide not to yeah

558
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,039
because and there could be a financial

559
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
impact as well donna from from the

560
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,000
prison service's point of view one of

561
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
the most closely guarded things always

562
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
in prison service has been where prison

563
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
officers live because the last thing you

564
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
want is prison officers addresses being

565
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
posted online it's just

566
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
that would be the fear factor that would

567
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,520
be there and there's laws in place to

568
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
prevent that from happening

569
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
but that's the kind of that would be is

570
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
that a motivating factor then to say

571
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
guys we really need to up our game here

572
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
that the the information that we have is

573
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
not just about bad guys it's about you

574
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,160
and your colleagues and the last thing

575
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
you want to do is let somebody in by

576
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,360
mistake is that a motivating factor to

577
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
counter what location is talking about

578
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,679
uh no absolutely it is and it's where

579
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,440
what what i try to use to get the

580
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,960
message across and

581
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
you know i think it's been reiterated by

582
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
a number of the speakers today is that

583
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
this isn't just a pure technology issue

584
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
the the the cyber security and the

585
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
warfare and what will happen this will

586
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
impact people and so it's a policy issue

587
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,559
and we need to get everybody to sit up

588
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,640
and stand up and understand that we all

589
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
have a role to play the human factor is

590
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
one of the biggest risks when it comes

591
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
to

592
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
potential breaches or

593
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
or somebody successfully infiltrating

594
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,919
your your systems

595
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,559
so we have a lot of information a lot of

596
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,000
personal information a lot of sensitive

597
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
information we've information on um

598
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
historical um people who are in our

599
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
custody current people in our custody

600
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
their families their visitors i mean

601
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
it's an inordinate amount of information

602
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
and very sensitive information about

603
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,640
you know in terms of intelligence and

604
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,000
the state of their health and everything

605
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
so we really need to think about this um

606
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,039
in a broader sense

607
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,240
and

608
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,760
the people i was going to say the guys

609
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
who want to get in there i'm presuming

610
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,360
it is more guys than women but the

611
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
people who want to rob that information

612
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,799
don't want to rob it to freak out your

613
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,679
your

614
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
your staff no they just want to get

615
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
money out of you guys are to disrupt the

616
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
service don't it's the information

617
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,159
oh it's

618
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
that information is absolutely relevant

619
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,799
and what i mean the impact is uh it

620
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
would disrupt

621
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,200
um

622
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
our service it would destroy or impact

623
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,039
the um the assurance that the public

624
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,600
have in us to maintain and ensure the

625
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,120
integrity the integrity and

626
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
confidentiality of the information that

627
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
we hold on our systems and the security

628
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
and safeguards around those technical

629
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,360
and organizing organizational measures

630
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,840
so yeah pat when we we've done this

631
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
conference a couple of times uh you and

632
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,039
i and donna you've been here as well

633
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,159
it's great to have our colleagues

634
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,080
joining us from overseas uh one of the

635
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
things you always talk about is the need

636
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,320
for interagency cooperation and you know

637
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
we we have interpol and you know we're

638
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
involved in europa and we've all these

639
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
wonderful agencies that do kind of link

640
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
up the whole time

641
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,799
but

642
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
when it comes to this level of activity

643
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,760
you know you're

644
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
you kind of need nato more than you need

645
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
interpol if i could put it that way how

646
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,799
good

647
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,120
is the cooperation

648
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
considering the scale of the challenge

649
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,039
that's potentially coming

650
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
yeah i think the cooperation has

651
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
improved i think probably will improve

652
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,400
even further with what's going on over

653
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
the last number of weeks

654
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,919
well i think it's open to us and in

655
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
garter chicana to talk to interpile

656
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
europa but further afield in our

657
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
colleagues in the us have been of great

658
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
help to us over the years and in more

659
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,679
recent past as well

660
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,440
for example last week we were on a

661
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
global um crime forum with interpol and

662
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,400
one of my superintendents made a

663
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
presentation to asia in the afternoon

664
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,559
and the next day he did a presentation

665
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,120
to the u.s and that's part of the world

666
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,640
and then the next day he did the

667
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
european part of it and basically what

668
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
we were looking at was an organized

669
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,400
crime gang that are operating

670
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,559
in the cyber-enabled crime world that

671
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,320
ronan would have mentioned this morning

672
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,080
you know it's the phishing dismishing

673
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
the business email compromise romance

674
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
fraud investment fraud and all of the

675
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,760
money from that

676
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,840
is being used in to fund other criminal

677
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,880
activity be it cyber warfare be it human

678
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,120
trafficking be it drugs

679
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,280
and one of my colleagues often use words

680
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
it's even paid to fund wars in other

681
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,200
countries that wouldn't be as obvious as

682
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,640
the one we're looking at at the moment

683
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,799
so there is great cooperation there

684
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
the the problem we face sometimes is

685
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
these networks that are coming at us

686
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
from the fraud they're coming from far

687
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
away countries where we don't have the

688
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
same impact on the ground with law

689
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
enforcement yeah but the the other side

690
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
of it that has that's different and

691
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
that's new is that where previously it

692
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
might have been a briefcase full of

693
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,559
dollars uh or like you know it's it's

694
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,000
easy trace wired

695
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,760
you know you guys have the ability to do

696
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
that

697
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
with cryptocurrencies uh the

698
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
conveniently created tool of the

699
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
internet these guys can make as much

700
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,480
money as they want and you'll never find

701
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,600
it you'll never find it run through a

702
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,679
bank well and i know the colonial

703
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,200
pipeline was covered this morning and

704
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
the money was recovered by great work by

705
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
the the u.s authorities in that case and

706
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
there have been some success stories

707
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,120
and i think the we've been looking at

708
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,480
this for three or four months now very

709
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,799
detailed on the tools that are available

710
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,799
to trace the money and we've had quite a

711
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,880
bit of success in tracing money into

712
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
different wallets the problem is when

713
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,200
you get to that country wherever it is

714
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
will you get the cooperation so we've

715
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,280
identified the country it's gone to

716
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,559
and actually we have the same problem

717
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,720
with fiat currency

718
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
if it goes to a country that's not

719
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
willing to cooperate with you so

720
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
i wouldn't be terrified about

721
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,760
cryptocurrency but i think we need to

722
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
learn a lot more about it and it does

723
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
need to be regulated a lot more yeah

724
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
good luck with that um right let's throw

725
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,120
it out to the floor if we can if you

726
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
have a question uh you might put up your

727
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
hand um or come to the microphone and i

728
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,279
can uh you can shout at me and i shout

729
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,480
with them is probably the best way to

730
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,840
describe it so has anyone got a question

731
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,840
yes

732
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,159
okay so just to repeat for the purpose

733
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,159
of the camera here uh cryptocurrency

734
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,679
this there talk about lack of regulation

735
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,520
how should we fill those gaps pat i

736
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
might ask this loki because as well how

737
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,799
do we fill those gaps and where's where

738
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,480
are the shortcomings right now yeah so i

739
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,559
would regularly attend fat f meetings in

740
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,200
in paris we're part of the fed f group

741
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
and for probably four or five years up

742
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,520
to two years ago when co would hit us

743
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,880
the feeling around the table was that

744
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
cryptocurrency was going to disappear

745
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,120
into the eater and that it wasn't here

746
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,600
to stay but i think most countries

747
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,279
around the table now have realized it's

748
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,600
here to stay and we need to regulate it

749
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
we know we need to know

750
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
who's purchasing it and who's selling it

751
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,480
the same as you would if you're

752
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,720
purchasing a draft in the bank and we

753
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,320
don't have that regulation at the moment

754
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
in most countries in most jurisdictions

755
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,840
it has been regulated quite well in

756
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,640
luxembourg and i know uh the head of the

757
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
fiu there they get regular suspicious

758
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,279
transaction reports from the

759
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,039
cryptocurrency exchanges that they're

760
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
dealing with there and that's public

761
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,679
knowledge so i think we need to i i

762
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,039
never frighten people away from

763
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,279
cryptocurrency what i do say is make

764
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,440
sure that you're buying it from a proper

765
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,400
source

766
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,279
because we have a lot of people

767
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,039
investing hundreds of thousands of euros

768
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,720
every day in cryptocurrency but they're

769
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
not investing in it they're buying it

770
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,679
for the criminal who's going to steal it

771
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,279
one hour later

772
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,720
and that's happening quite a lot but the

773
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,799
regulation is going to be very difficult

774
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
because it's going to be

775
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
immersed in a lot of jurisdictions that

776
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,520
are facilitating uh

777
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,919
the secrecy behind it and i know we have

778
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,000
some colleagues here from switzerland as

779
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,360
well so the swiss banks have had the

780
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
same issues i suppose over the years in

781
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,679
regard to secrecy and compliance and you

782
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,279
saw there in the media recently they've

783
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,279
come more under the pressure there

784
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,520
recently in relation to the way they're

785
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
doing compliance and that's not even in

786
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
the cryptocurrency world yeah lots of

787
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,799
challenges it's not going to be an easy

788
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,960
road but i think it needs to be

789
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
regulated by our central banks and our

790
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
supervisory bodies and then i think it

791
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
will be safer for all of us at laukick

792
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,000
i'm presuming it's a very similar that

793
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,679
we get bigger knows the us is you have

794
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,039
the same problems as pat here in ireland

795
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,720
don't you it's it

796
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,440
when we talk about regulation uh or any

797
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
place how do you regulate something when

798
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
it can be

799
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
created out of thin air

800
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
if you really look at it i can go

801
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,400
tomorrow and create cryptocurrency if i

802
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,880
knew how to do it the ledgers themselves

803
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
depending on what type of cryptocurrency

804
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
you have you're going to have the wide

805
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,240
spread you know some of them are very

806
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
public some of them very private some of

807
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,279
them are more controlled where it's a

808
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,480
private ledger

809
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
but when it comes down to it if i want

810
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
to to transfer large amounts of money

811
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,880
from here to say italy

812
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
currently it's very difficult

813
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,960
now if i use a currency with

814
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
cryptocurrency it's instantaneous

815
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,320
practically

816
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,559
now is all criminals using it no not

817
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,159
necessarily people who want to make some

818
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,000
money i i got that

819
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,039
but the way you can regulate it is going

820
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,520
to involve multi countries

821
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,279
multinationals

822
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,960
the jurisdiction is large and you just

823
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,679
need one to say nah

824
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
i don't want to do it yeah it's it's the

825
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
good old-fashioned

826
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,919
place you can hide where there's no

827
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,679
expedition treaty isn't it it's the same

828
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,279
concept okay thank you for that question

829
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,440
have we another question from the floor

830
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,880
um

831
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,880
yes

832
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
okay so about knowing your customer uh

833
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,679
when it comes to crypto in particular is

834
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,039
it yeah okay so knowing your customer

835
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,240
and how they use that i mean if i can

836
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,880
i'll come down the end to you if i can

837
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,399
um

838
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,760
how do you how do you work that with

839
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
through brian how do you explain it to

840
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,240
your customer whether they're doing the

841
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,360
right thing and how you know that

842
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
they're on a board if you're dealing

843
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,520
with customers and clients

844
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,720
let me make sure i understand the

845
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,440
question here uh how do i explain it to

846
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,000
my customers is that that yeah no sorry

847
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
do you want to go again i probably met

848
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
ayc i'd say yep know your customer when

849
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,960
they're coming in i can take it if you

850
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,840
yeah okay pat yeah so kyc is an

851
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,520
important part of the whole compliance

852
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,720
with money laundering and terrorist

853
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
financing legislation and obviously

854
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
flows into nations data attacks and

855
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,159
everything like that so you're dead

856
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,000
right you have to know who's putting the

857
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,919
money into your system so there will

858
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,480
have to be a system there that you know

859
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
who's putting the money in at the moment

860
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,120
if you go to revolut or in 52 or any of

861
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,799
those you have to produce your

862
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,559
identification before they will accept

863
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
and transfer your money

864
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
and you will have to have i believe the

865
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
same in the cryptocurrency world

866
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,080
but once you have a few nations that

867
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
don't impose that legislation that will

868
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,919
make a difficulty and that's what you

869
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,440
were just about to say brian wasn't it

870
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
yeah absolutely 100 uh thank you sorry

871
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,480
for making a mess of your question thank

872
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
you very much for asking uh we'll take

873
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,760
one more if we have it there from the

874
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,840
floor anyone else just

875
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,039
uh yeah okay sir

876
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,679
um

877
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,880
is

878
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
okay so in other words it's offensive go

879
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,840
on the offensive when you know who

880
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,720
you're

881
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,559
up against and and i suppose take the

882
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
initiative brian you can definitely take

883
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,679
that one yeah absolutely um so it is

884
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,279
the the two earlier things i talked

885
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,480
about collateral damage and then

886
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,760
proportionality um they they are kind of

887
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
they're easier to deal with it they're

888
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,159
not easy they're easier to deal with

889
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,600
when you're talking about nation states

890
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
who are you know have uh have oversight

891
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,120
and they have you know regulation and

892
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,600
they have uh you know standards that

893
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,360
they're adhering to

894
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,679
offensive cyber in that scenario makes

895
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,840
sense

896
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,679
it gets really complicated when when you

897
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,640
have non-state actors and

898
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
maybe state actors that abide by a

899
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,679
different set of rules so and i i think

900
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,000
in that in to answer the question you're

901
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,919
going to have offensive cyber that's not

902
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,360
going away but what we can do as a cyber

903
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,039
cyber security community

904
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,840
is we have to shore up our gaps in our

905
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
organization you don't have to be a

906
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,799
defense you don't have to be a police

907
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,840
force

908
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
but you have to you know have a

909
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,640
framework and and apply that framework

910
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,279
you have to train your users you have to

911
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,279
you know the hse attack was an email

912
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
phishing attack so you have to train

913
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,200
your users on what to look out for

914
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,440
you know patch your systems update your

915
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,559
system reduce your tax uh surface and

916
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,320
take on off if you have a system that

917
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,919
doesn't need to be publicly accessible

918
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,679
it's just for your employees don't have

919
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,360
it external to the internet close it

920
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,080
down and and just make sure you shore up

921
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,640
your gaps so that you are not affected

922
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,960
by the offensive cyber attacks there's a

923
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
wonderful phrase in radio that have al

924
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,159
that's always struck with me you know if

925
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,600
something went wrong

926
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
um the engineer would always explain

927
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,360
that was an air gap and i was what do

928
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
you mean by the air there was a gap

929
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,399
between the two cables plugging it into

930
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,480
the machine you can't beat it even when

931
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
it comes to cyber security um thank you

932
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,679
very much for those questions i have one

933
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,200
final question for each of you before i

934
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,919
let you go off the stage and it's about

935
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,679
how the next few months are going to go

936
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,760
how squeaky will our bombs be if we're

937
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,240
back at zero daycon 23 god willing donna

938
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,840
i'll start with you how worried are you

939
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,120
about how the next few months are going

940
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,559
to play out

941
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,000
um

942
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,840
to be honest i'm actually quite worried

943
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,919
because i i think

944
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,559
i mean there's already a cyber war

945
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,320
there's already attacks they're

946
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,600
happening

947
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
i think

948
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,000
based on the trajectory of what's

949
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,120
happening now between russia and the

950
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
ukraine there there's a

951
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,880
um there's a real risk that that's going

952
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,559
to increase and possibly impact the

953
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,919
western world so from a criminal justice

954
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,679
sector point of view or you know in in

955
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,120
terms of government critical

956
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,039
infrastructure the collateral damage

957
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
being impacted i think we have an awful

958
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
lot of work to do and i think we need to

959
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,720
start getting ready with our contingency

960
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,679
plans

961
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,919
regardless of this anyways we we need to

962
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:16,960
do that

963
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,039
loudly

964
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,840
well for me well i'll just say it it's

965
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,600
job security right there's always going

966
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,080
to be criminals that do anything

967
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,880
no matter what but i've never known a

968
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,799
year that's prior

969
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,519
that has been any

970
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,960
better than the one that you're

971
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,039
currently in meaning that i don't

972
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,799
remember 2012 was

973
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,240
worse than say 2013. no 2013 was worse

974
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,640
2014 was it every year has gotten

975
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
progressively

976
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,120
worse

977
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,919
so in the next few months this year it's

978
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,440
going to be worse than 22 and 22 was

979
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,519
pretty bad when i put it up there

980
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,880
uh i can only imagine what 24 and 23 24

981
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,039
gonna be like if that's already bad so

982
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
but we'll deal with it

983
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,600
job security yeah still there like we're

984
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,799
we're watching fuel prices here it's

985
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,159
probably an indication of how it's going

986
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,080
to go pad lord and same question yeah i

987
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,279
would agree with the two previous

988
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,720
speakers um

989
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,640
i'm probably not afraid of it

990
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,880
i think ireland inc is in a really good

991
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
place i think all of the people in the

992
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
room here are doing the right thing and

993
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,679
i think that's very important we had a

994
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,000
good drive run last year yeah we had

995
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,039
but i think if we have all the

996
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,399
technology in place

997
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,720
and you know i was very taken and i went

998
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
out and spoke to him i i didn't buy a

999
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
swiss watch off him because they're

1000
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,600
quite expensive

1001
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,640
and he doesn't take cryptocurrency but

1002
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
i think we need to work with our people

1003
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,399
and he made it very clear

1004
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,039
um as did our our speaker from london

1005
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
about the cancer research you need to

1006
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
bring your people with you there's no

1007
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,159
point in having all of the technology

1008
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,519
and not explaining how it's going to

1009
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,840
work and i think if we work we're not

1010
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
good at this we're very good at putting

1011
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,519
in the technology we're very good at

1012
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,600
putting in the best experts in that area

1013
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,279
but we need everybody else to play ball

1014
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,120
as well and i think the other important

1015
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,080
point is

1016
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,000
everybody in the room here should have

1017
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,519
their contact in their local law

1018
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,519
enforcement whether it's to do with

1019
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,399
fraud cyber-enabled crime or pure cyber

1020
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
crime and and we have put a lot of

1021
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,239
resources into the economic crime bureau

1022
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,079
over the last 12 months we've almost

1023
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,359
doubled the number of people working on

1024
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,199
the cyber enabled crime and it's paying

1025
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,639
off we're locking up a lot of these guys

1026
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,239
at the moment yeah and over the next six

1027
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,918
months there'll be more on the cyber

1028
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,199
crime that's keeping down in business by

1029
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,639
the way don't yeah yeah we're going to

1030
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,119
keep going we will and then on the cyber

1031
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,800
crime side more people are going in

1032
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,320
there in the next couple of weeks and

1033
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,918
there will be hubs around the country as

1034
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,440
well that have been developed over the

1035
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
last two years and they'll be getting

1036
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,199
better staff so that'll make it easier

1037
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,639
for all of you around the country to

1038
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,480
link in with somebody from law

1039
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,159
enforcement brian obviously you you have

1040
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,440
your experience in the military uh

1041
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
you're now working in education which

1042
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
you might think is safe but i know from

1043
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,599
speaking to people in education it ain't

1044
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,119
safe at all and that's one of the places

1045
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,040
they're going to target straight away

1046
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,239
how do you feel the next few months are

1047
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
going to go i think

1048
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,599
the

1049
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
the likelihood of attacks permeating to

1050
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,040
countries outside of ukraine very high

1051
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,119
you know very high so what the last

1052
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,960
thing i would like to say is just you

1053
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,440
know yes do all the put the controls in

1054
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359

1055
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,520
things in place to secure your systems

1056
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
your users your networks

1057
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,400
but

1058
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,760
beyond that assume breach assume breach

1059
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,160
be prepared to respond to and recover

1060
