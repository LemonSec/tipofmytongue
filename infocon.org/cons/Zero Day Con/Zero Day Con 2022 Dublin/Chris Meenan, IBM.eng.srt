1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,919
okay um hi everyone i think you can all

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,519
hear me um hear myself now so um yeah i

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,960
feel really lucky actually with the

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
setup of some of the speakers today

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,239
particularly the points that ronan and

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,320
eric were making about

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,359
um

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,960
about the fact we're up against

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,279
adversaries that are sharing and

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,760
collaborating together moving extremely

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,800
quickly

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
and now and the points eric was making

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
about needing to innovate and move more

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,160
quickly and address much of the debt

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
technology debt

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,239
knowledge debt

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,079
and

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,760
yeah technology

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
and innovation not not being able to

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
innovate quickly enough i think we're

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
you know definitely can all agree that

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,960
we have

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,360
too much to do it's not getting any

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
easier we are continually having to

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
secure new bits of our it infrastructure

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,920
as we're modernizing and moving

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,680
workloads to the cloud as we're

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
modernizing applications as we're moving

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,280
our data sources and databases and data

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
stores out to cloud and sas platforms

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
and what we need to do

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,600
really as a as a whole market is look

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,320
for

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,040
ways that we can be more innovative that

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
we can move at the speed of attacker

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,360
attack the attackers are and how we can

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
deliver more effective security quickly

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,880
and it's a real problem today in that

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
organizations technology vendors like

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
ourselves and our customers spend a lot

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
of time dealing with proprietary

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
interfaces proprietary detection

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,759
technologies proprietary intelligence

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,079
and that this actually is a major factor

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,240
in holding us back and it actually is is

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
getting us it's getting worse

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
so if we take a little bit of a step

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
back and just look at you know why why

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,920
are things getting worse um why is this

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
problem not getting any easier how can

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
we move what's stopping us moving more

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,440
quickly

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
well when we look at we look across our

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
customer base and organizations as a

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
whole there's like four main trends we

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
see that is just adding to work

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
fundamentally it's giving security teams

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,319
much more work and much more complexity

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,640
first of all everyone is on some sort of

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
cloud journey that has evolved that that

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,920
is essentially meaning additional

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,720
security controls and in many cases

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
additional security

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,519
technologies to secure these new

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,599
cloud infrastructures new it

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,319
infrastructures be it containers or sas

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,360
services or our cloud platforms

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
we know that

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
people work from anywhere now that is

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
now driving you know the complete

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
disappearance of the perimeter so

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,599
there's no additional controls new

73
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,400
concerns about these remote

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
remote employees remote unmanaged

75
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
endpoints

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
accessing cloud services directly

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
without coming back in by the vpn many

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
organizations ibm and ibm's not alone

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
we're looking at how we can get rid of

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
our vpn completely so there's all of

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,640
these new these new working practices

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,599
are again giving the security teams more

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,400
work to do more work to do and at the

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
same time and we were talking about this

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
over dinner last night you know the

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,239
increasing regulatory and privacy

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,440
concerns as well are really amping up so

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,000
this is just tightening the noose in

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
terms of okay what are all your controls

90
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,159
around your existing

91
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,680
existing

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
existing infrastructure as well as your

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
next generation infrastructure and of

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,040
course as ronan has been saying and

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
previous speakers the threat environment

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
is just continuing to evolve and get

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
more and more intense

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,599
so as a result of this digital

99
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
transformation that's happening we're

100
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,760
getting more and more tools

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
more and more security tools

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
more and more controls more and more uh

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
regulatory um

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,640
reports and audits to fulfill and how

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
much broader attack surface

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,680
and fundamentally security is going go

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,238
is getting increasingly fragmented i

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,479
mean i've been um i've been

109
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,600
in the sim business for 12 years now and

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
i remember um

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,759
when i i joined

112
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
q1 labs and our ceo at the time saying

113
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
there's too many security tools out

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
there everything's going to consolidate

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
um onto one platform and this is what

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
it's going to look like and that was

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,960
eight years ago

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
and actually the problems just got worse

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
and it's continuing to get worse we are

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
starting to see the emergence of some of

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
these platforms but it is there's still

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
a plethora

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
of new

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
disconnected

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
tooling out there for to address not

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
only existing infrastructure but next

127
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
generation cloud infrastructure sas

128
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
infrastructure endpoints ot iot etc

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
and as a result

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
it's adding more work and it's not

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
valuable work

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
actually

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,000
what we see in the industry is 50 of the

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,639
cost of running security is integrating

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,520
security integrating security systems to

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,720
talk to each other and the other 50

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,039
is actually spent on operationalizing

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,360
the output and running the systems and

139
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,960
actually leveraging and getting the

140
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
value you want that is a tremendous

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,039
waste first of all it's a tremendous

142
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,919
waste

143
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,800
of resources and money but also it is

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
really slowing us down

145
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
and this is all because the industry

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
doesn't have standards

147
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
doesn't have interoperability built in

148
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
at its heart it doesn't have the concept

149
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,639
of

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,600
openness and interoperability

151
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
everything is a proprietary connection

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
everything is a one-to-one integration

153
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
and adds cost to us as vendors because

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
we have to integrate with every other

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
tool out there and then it adds cost and

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
time to

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
uh end user organizations as well when

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
those integrations don't exist or when

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,280
there's um or when they become out of

160
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,479
date

161
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,280
so this um this additional complexity is

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,759
just opening up new opportunities for

163
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,440
adversaries it in it means you struggle

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
organizations struggle with visibility

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
they struggle with workflow across these

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,080
disconnected tools how can i answer

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,560
simple questions like you know what did

168
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,840
chris do

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
across my cloud across my entire

170
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,199
environment with um you know a

171
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,199
particular domain or where have i seen

172
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,759
this file or hash across my environment

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,680
when it's spread across multiple clouds

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
and sas services for example

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,880
then also with these different

176
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
different cloud environments there's a

177
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
real challenge in keeping up to date

178
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
like how do i keep my detections up to

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
date log4j was a great example there

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
were weeks going by when we were seeing

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
organizations who didn't have effective

182
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
detection in place whereas the attackers

183
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,880
are moving like this much much faster

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
so keeping those detections up to date

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
is like getting harder and harder as

186
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
well especially when the the skills and

187
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,680
availability of those skills is so

188
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
challenged i'm just fundamentally

189
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
struggling to keep up with work

190
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
so one of the things that's really been

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
growing in the industry and that you

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,840
know

193
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,800
ibm are really behind and there's a

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
group of us in the security unit have

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,479
been really a driving force to try and

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
grow this initiative and really widen is

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,360
this concept of open security where

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,599
security tools if you could imagine a

199
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,960
world where security capabilities become

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
truly plug and play

201
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
and that doesn't mean just have open

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
apis rest apis it means actual true plug

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,039
and play to be able to like you can

204
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,440
today where you can take servers from

205
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
different companies and you can run

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
operating systems on them and you can

207
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,039
run applications on them and you don't

208
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,960
need to worry about all the specifics

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,080
imagine a world where you can take a sim

210
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
an edr you can take that the equivalent

211
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,560
of a sim um that's looking after azure

212
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
or or aws and just connect it into your

213
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,319
security platform and it just works your

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
security teams are hidden from the

215
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,880
complexities the the detections are

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,919
being um can be shared and and

217
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
operationalized across that entire

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
infrastructure and then imagine a world

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,120
then where with open security your whole

220
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,880
can you can leverage the power of the

221
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,920
whole community to take detections

222
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
and response actions that are best

223
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
practiced and have been developed in the

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
click of a finger

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
and use them effectively in your

226
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
organization you know that that log4j is

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
a great example of this um it it it um

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,080
log4j was an einstein on on thursday on

229
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
a

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
thursday in the first week of december

231
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,640
and um

232
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
there were open source detections within

233
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,440
an hour

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
available

235
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,519
within an hour

236
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,760
the community had come together

237
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
and were collaborating hundreds of them

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
hundreds of engineers across different

239
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
companies and providers we're

240
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,600
collaborating on on open detection

241
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,160
techno open detection logic the

242
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
challenge is of course

243
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,360
the tooling out there in the industry

244
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
doesn't fully support that

245
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,000
and of course you need more than just

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
one piece you need the full end-to-end

247
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,680
life cycle um to to fully operationalize

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,279
that so we really

249
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,920
we believe that open security is a real

250
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,839
game changer in terms of really

251
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
helping deliver

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,680
helping deliver innovation more quickly

253
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
help deliver

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,200
remove some of that legacy proprietary

255
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,440
technical debt and address a lot of the

256
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
skills challenges and fundamentally

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,839
allow us as an industry to respond more

258
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,959
quickly

259
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,800
so when we think about the challenges of

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,519
of of what we have around clue

261
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,440
close security and which is where we

262
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
really are today for the most part we've

263
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
got a bunch of proprietary technologies

264
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
with vendor-specific apis that we spend

265
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,839
a bunch of time integrating with and

266
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
keeping up to date there's no real

267
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,920
community collaboration about making

268
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,399
sure that security systems can talk to

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,160
each other in a meaningful real way

270
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
there's vendors lots of vendor specific

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
content out there i mean i'm a vendor i

272
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
really like it when we do some really

273
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
smart analytics or rules and then we

274
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
write a blog up and we push that content

275
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
out to our customers but it's only us

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
like why does it why does it need to be

277
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
us it should really be the whole

278
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
community doing that that's how we can

279
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
best defend ourselves

280
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
and then we end up with these lots of

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
fragmented tools and interfaces which

282
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,880
means we you know organizations to spend

283
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,480
time trying to

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
you know how do i how do i stop my

285
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
analysts having to visit 10 different

286
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
screens and and

287
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
and translate from queries from one

288
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
language to another depending on i won't

289
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
need to check my endpoints i need to

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,519
check the network i need to check azure

291
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,959
i need to check my on-premise

292
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
infrastructure

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
whereas with open security

294
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
we can move to a world where there are

295
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
open standards and proper

296
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,320
interoperability

297
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,519
where if i if i if i have a detection i

298
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
can just issue that detection out to my

299
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
platforms and they will operationalize

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,360
it i don't need to worry about all the

301
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
vendor specific comp vendor specific

302
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,959
implementation i can use best the breed

303
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
capabilities

304
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
or i can just use what's free from a

305
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,399
cloud vendor if it makes sense for my

306
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,440
business

307
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
or if i've invested in a big logging

308
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,320
platform with all the data in it that my

309
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
security analysts need i should just be

310
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
able to connect that to my security

311
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,680
system or platform and be able to oper

312
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
and be able to leverage it without

313
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
having to spend days and weeks

314
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
integrating it

315
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
and this will fundamentally allow us as

316
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
a community to collaborate more

317
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
effectively so where we can take that

318
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
log for j for example log4j detection

319
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,399
example and actually just use it and

320
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
operationalize it immediately

321
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
instead of having to take that and

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
translate it into all the tools and

323
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
languages that we

324
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
amongst the myriad of something like is

325
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
it 80 tools typically most stocks have

326
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
in their organization

327
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
and that will just help us move more

328
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,800
quickly at reducing blind spots and

329
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
responding to threats

330
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
so there's lots of benefits from this

331
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
and and um you know

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
eric touched upon like this need to

333
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,600
innovate and move more quickly um ronan

334
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,959
talked about the fact that you know

335
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,639
these attackers are collaborating and

336
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,040
sharing we can now collaborate and share

337
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
and operationalize that much more

338
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
quickly and actually at ibm this is

339
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
something that we like it goes right to

340
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
the top in ibm our cso now is you know

341
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,560
he is bam he moved in the um cruz moved

342
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
into the role around four years ago now

343
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,560
and um he has now got to the point where

344
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
you are we are we're well on our down

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
the road of a zero trust journey

346
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
involving on moving all of our internal

347
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
business-run applications out to the

348
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,000
cloud and we leverage sas services for

349
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
hr for

350
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
payroll for travel

351
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,839
for

352
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,279
um yeah for everything uh file sharing

353
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,000
and collaboration and we also leverage

354
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
um

355
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,600
our own internal security team but he is

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,639
um

357
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
he has really said this has got too

358
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,720
complex now

359
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,959
we're spending too much time integrating

360
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,880
we're too slow to respond so he's

361
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
insisting that new technologies really

362
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
adopt open source and open standards

363
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,279
and ibm along with mcafee started an

364
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,920
open source open cyber security alliance

365
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
a couple of years ago under the oasis

366
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
program

367
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
really uh and we now have over 20

368
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
vendors in there so we're big companies

369
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,560
on there like i'm actually crowdstriker

370
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,199
in there mcafee are in there trend micro

371
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,720
have joined rapid seven etc and they are

372
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
all now in there around defining open

373
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,079
source and open standards open standards

374
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
first but then supported by open source

375
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,480
code and it's really effective it

376
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
basically means that organization say

377
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
for example we define

378
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
a query api for how a system should be

379
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
able to query another security system to

380
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
get information for example

381
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
what domains that chris visit in the

382
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
last week for example but actually now

383
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
submitting open source code into github

384
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,160
for each of the technology vendors

385
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
in the industry so that now we have that

386
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
one api that can be shared and what's

387
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,639
really exciting is we're starting to see

388
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,560
that being used we're using it and i've

389
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
got some examples coming up of how we're

390
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,959
leveraging that but also companies like

391
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,360
trend micro trend microbes hitting that

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,320
technology embedded in their xdr product

393
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,199
uh as has mcafee really this is really

394
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
powerful now because it means we're

395
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
sharing that integration layer and we're

396
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,279
using these open source and open

397
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,639
standards

398
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
um so if i just um if we just take an

399
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
example of like oh just quickly of how

400
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
this can actually you know some tangible

401
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,399
examples of how it is being leveraged if

402
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
we look at you know a sock today

403
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
you know there's there's never just one

404
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
system you go to for visibility or

405
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
response or investigation and as a

406
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
previous slide this is getting more

407
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
complex

408
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
you have your same

409
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
sim for your logging you typically will

410
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
have an edr obviously for endpoint

411
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,199
because that's where all the attacks are

412
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
coming in and you need protection and be

413
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,759
able to block and respond very quickly

414
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
and then typically most organizations

415
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
also will look at the network because

416
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
you'll have gaps in what your logs are

417
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,880
telling you and you don't have ed

418
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
endpoints everywhere so you need that

419
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
network level visibility but then of

420
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
course there's many more tools in terms

421
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
of visibility here especially when you

422
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
start going to the cloud you start

423
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
looking at containerized workloads

424
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,800
and this actually just results

425
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,240
on the left hand side some of that

426
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
complexity that i talked about analysts

427
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,759
typically you might get all your alerts

428
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,519
into one place but they'll end up

429
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,120
pivoting off into lots of different

430
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
tools but with open source with open

431
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
source and open standards we can

432
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,199
actually create unified workflows

433
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
that work with any tool because we have

434
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,079
those standard apis and standard

435
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,560
interfaces and standard ontologies for

436
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,040
how information is exchanged and high

437
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
information

438
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,639
and the apis for exchanging that

439
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
information and this enables this world

440
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
of okay where you know everyone wants to

441
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
be over there on the left obviously i'm

442
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,560
a i'm an ibm vendor i want everyone to

443
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,399
buy ibm stuff but that's not always

444
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
going to happen

445
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,079
you know the real world is there

446
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
organizations have made investments

447
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
already you may be there maybe you

448
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
invest new technologies you want to use

449
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
because they're free you know they just

450
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,880
come with cloud platforms or come

451
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
embedded what you what what open source

452
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
and open standards enable you to do or

453
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
start delivering simplicity some

454
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,959
simplified workflows

455
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
simplified outcomes operationalize

456
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,760
community content effectively and

457
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,200
quickly

458
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
across whatever tooling makes sense

459
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
and this is just an example of if i just

460
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
walk through some tangible examples

461
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,120
where we're now using with customers and

462
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
internally in leveraging these open

463
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,840
source communities and content so first

464
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
of all we have you know a attack is a

465
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
great way to manage your attack surface

466
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
so now you no longer have to think about

467
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,320
you know

468
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
what what tactics and techniques should

469
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
i address and have some science project

470
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
around it there's no open source

471
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
open standards around that and that's

472
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,760
well adopted now then we move to okay

473
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
i understand my gaps how do i close them

474
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
now sigma is very powerful in the open

475
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,919
source community as a way of defining

476
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,799
those open that detection that's vendor

477
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
neutral and now with the oca and a

478
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
project within the usa called stick

479
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,919
shifter i can actually take that content

480
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
and i can run it against all my systems

481
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,679
in a vendor-neutral way and i can see if

482
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,080
i'm being attacked if i've got that

483
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
particular

484
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
attack vector being um

485
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,919
controlled um being used in my

486
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,400
environment so all very simple you know

487
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
much simpler than where we are today and

488
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
and you could have multiple systems

489
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
sitting beneath that but because they're

490
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,559
all using open source and open standards

491
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
you can simplify the output workflow for

492
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,840
the user another example is then on the

493
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,400
on the response side of things you're

494
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
gathering all those alerts from your

495
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,000
cloud platform your endpoint your

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
network your sim your your container

497
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
security bringing those together and

498
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,440
then automating investigation

499
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,960
being able to then build that one

500
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
timeline across what's happened across

501
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
your environment that's possible with

502
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,280
open source and open standards we're not

503
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,679
getting in the we're not letting vendor

504
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,160
neutral sorry vendor proprietary

505
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
technologies get in the way and

506
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,520
interfaces and then finally when we want

507
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,200
to take action open c2 again part of

508
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
what we're doing in the oca is starting

509
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
to define

510
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,480
open standards and open apis for how

511
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
we respond how we can mitigate in a

512
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
vendor neutral and vendor

513
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,880
vendor agnostic way so all of this

514
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,760
really

515
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
aligned takes us to a potential future

516
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,919
where open security can really enable us

517
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,080
to deliver unification and simplicity

518
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,120
for our ap for our users it can deliver

519
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
innovation

520
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
it can really deliver innovation because

521
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,280
now

522
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
we're not you know the innovation isn't

523
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
tied to specific companies with specific

524
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
technology they can leverage

525
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
leverage the technologies out there and

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,120
leverage the full community in terms of

527
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,159
um

528
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,960
in terms of those capabilities and an

529
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
enabler and deliver a world where we can

530
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
start connecting security tools together

531
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
in a fraction of the time that we do

532
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,760
today and give that choice enable that

533
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
choice for organizations around where

534
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,039
they run their security platforms what

535
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
security tooling they

536
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
they need to use for your specific

537
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,120
industry or whatever makes business

538
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,640
sense at the time

539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
but importantly

540
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,640
getting away from that having to spend

541
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
50 percent of your

542
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
50 of your resources doing that

543
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
integration work and keeping it up to

544
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,559
date i'm fundamentally allowing us to

545
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,560
respond more quickly to attackers

546
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,649
