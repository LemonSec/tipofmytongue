chathausen we're selling watches

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,560
obviously

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,119
is someone who doesn't know the

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,560
brand okay

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,720
um what we are doing here with in terms

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
of security we are very active since

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
more than 10 years in security why

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
because we were one of the first brands

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320
using all the technology from social

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
media google and using our stuff so

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,840
today this morning what we saw is really

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
a lot about technology what really gets

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,239
forgotten really people forget is the

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,079
users the end users and this is

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
something we haven't seen here leslie

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,600
from microsoft

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
explained empathy so on but what i

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,239
totally missed is how can i sell it

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
how can i change how can i establish a

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,199
security culture in my company

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
you can out you can go here through the

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,399
door buy your technology

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,559
go to zac bytanium

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,320
mr bruce schneider the absolute security

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
guru set

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,360
and i fully agree with him after doing

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
this 10 years at a very dynamic company

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
if you think technology can solve your

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
security problems then you don't

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
understand the problems and you don't

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,520
understand the technology

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
and i absolutely agree with him because

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
security in a real life not from a

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,799
vendor

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
is what we also heard from aptiv this

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
morning also from icr

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,159
it's not working if you don't have a

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,640
balance of these three areas we have

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,600
process we have people and technology

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,479
we heard from icr problems oh why do you

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
change this why you are doing this and

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,200
so on and there is no way of really

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,040
bringing the people um

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
to to change the behavior

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,439
so why is this so so some if something

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,439
happens you know is this in the in the

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,079
business there's an incident

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,240
everyone is talking about it everyone is

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
it's cooking

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
and then it's gone

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,479
and this is really a problem because the

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,399
next incident is just

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,360
um days away so the target of the

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,840
awareness is to keep the to keep talking

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
about it here so how do you do it

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
any recipes you're buying an e-learning

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,920
and a fishing test and then send it out

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,080
and expect people to change the behavior

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
it doesn't work we all know that so what

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
is the recipe what can we do here

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
there's a clear majority curve and i

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,879
always said there's two ways of doing it

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
one is you do it because of compliance

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
you have to do it you're regulated or

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
you're going for an iso certification so

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
what do you do i do the necessary thing

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,440
because i have other things to do

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
but if you really want to change the the

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
culture and the behavior of your users

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
it needs to make it sexy it needs to be

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
fun you know security can be we have

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
wonderful stories we heard everything

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
here why you don't sell it

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
why you don't sell it to the people and

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,319
make things um interesting to them

80
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
that's that's really a problem so how

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,160
can you do that that's a good question

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
security is a change process it's

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
something you have to do is something

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,720
you do every day and only if these three

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
things work together then you will in

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
fact um really get um security working

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
so how do you do that awareness there's

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
a lot it's empathy yes you're right but

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
how do you sell it how do you make

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
people do it

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
do you do you agree e-learning on friday

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
afternoon before deadline i'm doing it

93
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
20 minutes before

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
right click click click buy this change

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,239
no it's not

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
so so what do you do so what we have

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
done first of all think about when you

98
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
talk when you have when you communicate

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
build a communication plan

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
check when there's big events in your

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
company i know it's

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
we have to talk about scalability in

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
large enterprises like aptiv or whatever

104
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
there's other strategies but i'm showing

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,799
you the generic way if you launch a

106
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
campaign think about the business if

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,760
there's vacation time stop in may june

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
doing activities and go back again in

109
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,720
september

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
if there's christmas i know it is it's

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
the same here in ireland or in the uk or

112
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
wherever before christmas end of

113
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
november stop talking and then start in

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
the new year so build a communication

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
plan but keep in mind the context of of

116
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
your company and when there's major

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
events people forget that they tend to

118
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,959
forget that completely

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,640
if you build an awareness campaign a

120
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
real awareness campaign go and build an

121
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,599
advisory board i'm sure there's people

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
from the business but there's all it

123
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,959
guys security guys you don't speak the

124
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
language

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
you start up starting communication you

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
make awareness campaigns you don't talk

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
the language you need an advisory board

128
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
with key stakeholders from the business

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
why because they know where to pinpoint

130
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,960
they can tell you your campaign is crap

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
it will work or not

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
you know there's maybe legal things

133
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,919
there's maybe hr things

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,680
make an advice report we have created an

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
advisory report of 10 15 people and

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
everything that we plan who we plan to

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
communicate goes through this board you

138
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
know just to see if people understand

139
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
that this is something you have to um

140
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
consider and think about it

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
if you look for a reference model how to

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
do that there's the science institute we

143
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
heard sometimes this morning about this

144
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
it's a wonderful model really there's

145
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,199
everything you need they say there's

146
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,440
five stages so you don't have um

147
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
awareness it's compliance focused

148
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
promoting it behavior change and so on

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
and so on wonderful use that but there's

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
one thing

151
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
how to sell it

152
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
there's always hunt to sell it i did all

153
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
the trainings for security awareness and

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
for me a key topic for security

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,400
awareness is branding we are all driven

156
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,080
by logos right

157
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
see here nice logos you know you have

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
your favorite your starbucks whatever

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
what dismissed here there was a seven

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
day training i did

161
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,360
was one slide about

162
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
branding your campaign give it the name

163
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
it should live it was about smokey the

164
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,560
bear from the forest service and this

165
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
was it after hundreds of slides

166
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,479
but

167
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,479
if you have your users

168
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
they're flooded by information they're

169

184
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
behavior we heard it all this morning

185
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,800
this is our campaign

200
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
we are using pictures we are doing it in

201
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
english in german we are using the

202
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
pictures to transport the message

203
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
because also what we heard this morning

204
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
pictures are emotions

205
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,479
right you need to talk about it and this

206
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,440
makes people we are the best kpis in the

207
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
internet we have the most attendees in

208
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
luncheon learns where we

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
it's just it works and i saw it in many

210
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
other companies as well which i support

211
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
in terms of awareness so this is

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
something really you have to keep in

213
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
mind and do do it sexy make it

214
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,680
consumable for them tips and tricks give

215
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
them the free tips they have at home the

216
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
same problems we heard about backup this

217
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
morning ransomware they have it at home

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
the tips are one to one a fishing

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,319
tips and tricks is the same at home

220
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,319
so there is no magic just give them

221
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
people like that why are all the hacker

222
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,400
movies always in the top number one in

223
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
in in itunes because it's a cool story

224
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
you have so many stories to tell just do

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
it right and make it sexy

226
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
here further things um what we did for

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
example yeah we use all opportunities to

228
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,879
talk about

229
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,759
2008 what we had here was uh about fake

230
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
news today it's more than

231
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
than and then up to date during the

232
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,919
pandemic we said look if you get

233
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
vaccinated don't post your vaccination

234
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
pass on social media hey i'm vaccinated

235
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,280
and you see the numbers of the of the of

236
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
the vaccination so people copy your

237
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,919
vaccination path and put on the numbers

238
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
so this is something people love that

239
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,520
people love these stories you just need

240
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,680
to make it consumable for them so these

241
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
are all the different other things we

242
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,000
we spoke about

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
these are examples from other companies

244
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
doing it give it a logo give it a name

245
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
give it a brand

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
this was our first campaign we did with

247
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,720
the pilot watch the commercial um

248
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
and and just give it a name and and

249
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,599
brand it

250
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,360
so how do you get started how can you do

251
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
that there's several ways of doing it

252
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
one method i really like and i always

253
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
use in my campaigns is design thinking

254
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
so when you start yeah just emphasize

255
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
define it go back does it work is an

256
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
idea prototype show it to normal people

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,399
show it to advisory board

258
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
select from every group target group you

259
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,959
have just select a couple of people show

260
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
him how do you like it what do you like

261
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,160
what do you prefer

262
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
it's a it's a normal way of evaluating

263
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,279
things

264
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
if you have workshops or if you plan to

265
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
do something

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,279
who heard about lego serious play

267
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
now come on no one heard about it this

268
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,440
is a fantastic way developed in the 90s

269
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
by um yeah professors in denmark and i

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
used to do some couple of workshops with

271
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,120
it it's not playing lego it's a serious

272
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
way of

273
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
doing workshops with your people because

274
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
why when you have a whiteboard

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
and you know when to have these yellow

276
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,959
stickers

277
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,560
after the third one everyone is writing

278
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
the same and here here in lego serious

279
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
play

280
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,160
you have to explain what you're thinking

281
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
there is no hiding

282
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,519
and you have to really to go so i've

283
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,040
done workshops with this to create

284
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,680
awareness topics this works perfect

285
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
people love that everyone loves lego

286
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
right so this is something for the

287
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
adults these sets are horrible expensive

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,279
two thousand two thousand five hundred

289
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,440
bucks there's a method you can buy books

290
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,839
just google it lego serious play so this

291
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
is really something i can absolutely

292
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
recommend and do that

293
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
so we are not the only ones um

294
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
i would say i'm doing this we won many

295
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
awards just a small selection of it for

296
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,079
best internal communication best

297
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,240
branding best campaigns awareness and we

298
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,680
are not the only ones doing that there's

299
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
many of them so again this morning we

300
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,200
heard about technique we heard about

301
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
process don't forget the human and make

302
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
it consumable and make it cool for them

303
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
they absolutely love that and this is

304
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
absolutely key

305
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,279
so my six principles i would like to

306
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
give you for today make it risk driven

307
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
look what are the risks we have phishing

308
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
social engineering data loss or whatever

309
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
is our issue check which communication

310
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,680
channels you have how to reach the

311
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
people

312
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
if you're an industrial company

313
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
they don't have email use blackboard use

314
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,920
stickers use whatever is possible check

315
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,399
the communication channels

316
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,760
then you have culture if you're

317
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
multinational

318
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
look if you're

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
let me say that we are working for a

320
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
large company which is based in the

321
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,720
french part of switzerland um french

322
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
love french people love jokes

323
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
so what they did was to do an awareness

324
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
campaign doing french jokes translating

325
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
them into english in german that's not

326
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,040
the same

327
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,760
okay so be careful here culture is is a

328
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
big thing make it neutral or do

329
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
something for the for the french guys in

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
special

331
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
you uh use advice report for people from

332
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
the business you don't understand the

333
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
people you don't speak the language if

334
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
you write something about that

335
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
it's not consumable for them because me

336
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
as an ito security guy i write

337
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,839
differently as maybe someone from the

338
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,079
marketing or from the hr or from the

339
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,480
machine workers whatever so you need

340
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
someone to that um to do that

341
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
top-down support absolutely important i

342
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
know it's difficult management awareness

343
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,880
in the management is a different story i

344
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
think i always said there's two

345
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
different things is the no the workers

346
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
the the the normal people and the

347
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
management management is always they're

348
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
busy it's always about the money um

349
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,120
yesterday there was some some discussion

350
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
in the evening how to get them honestly

351
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,639
if hits the fan then you will get

352
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
them if it's money it's risk or whatever

353
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
you need to check what they are looking

354
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
for or what is important to them for its

355
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
reputation

356
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,279
you know you don't buy a watch for 20

357
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
000 bucks because of the time for us

358
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
it's like uh

359
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,079
it's an emotional thing we're selling

360
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,600
emotions we're selling dreams that's

361
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
that's important to us instead of money

362
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
i would say so this is important

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
branding yes you saw some examples here

364
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
ends with a question why why the hell i

365
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,040
have to use that why i need to use get

366
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
visibility which is a fantastic tool

367
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
why you need to explain that and you

368
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
need to see what is the benefit out of

369
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,839
that

370
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,680
and in the end do your homework talk to

371
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
the people see what's working and do

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,959
that thank you
