1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
let's talk about zero trust gentlemen um

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
i'm i'm going to begin with you donnie

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,639
if i can

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
i'm going to plead the aegis right what

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,960
is it

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,440
it was it was coined by a guy called

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,039
stephen marsh in 1994 um in his thesis

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
when he was in university of starling

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,680
and it was

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,359
popularized by

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
forrester and then nist in there

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,238
in their zero trust architecture so

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,920
basically

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
you know the traditional

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
way of looking at networks would be

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
everything outside untrustworthy

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,239
everything inside let's trust it

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
and it turns out in its head so that

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,320
there's it's basically perimeter less

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,280
so

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
everything

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,000
and everyone is untrusted yes and i made

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,559
the point earlier it is almost counter

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
to how we function as humans that there

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
always is an inherent level of trust

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,160
unless the person in front of you is

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
wielding a knife or a gun you're going

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
to think they're not going to harm you

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
um but you can't assume that in cyber

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,960
anymore

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
no like you

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
well

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
you look at it in a way that you know

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,240
never trust always verify

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,280
and

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
what what i mean by that is

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
um

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
you're always

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
authenticating you're always checking

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
to make sure that either that person

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
has access should have access to your

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,600
your resources or your network

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,320
um or whether it's that service that's

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,040
within your platform as well if that

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
makes sense this isn't you i mean you

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
made the fact that this is 94 i think

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,079
you said it was straight but this has

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,360
been around since the 80s since we

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
started coding isn't it

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
it's been around for for a long time

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
like um now

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
maybe it wasn't zero trust but it was

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,119
certainly trust anyway in

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,840
in computing and i guess my first

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
exposure to that would have been

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,360
in around 1980s

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
i grew up in the zx spectrum era i

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
remember i was a commodore 64. man i'm

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,679
disgusted with you

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,599
so it was the one with the rubber keys

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
um and

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,560
there was the first time that i i guess

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,319
i came across it was

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
um at one of the computer games

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
it was one called jet set willy i don't

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,879
know if

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,599
anybody's used to play it or not but um

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,520
on the inside sleeve of the cassette

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
tape was a card and on that card was a

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
grid and

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
there was different colors within each

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
part of the grid and when you load

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
eventually when you go to the machine

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
the game um it would ask you for

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
coordinates and you'd put in the colors

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
and without that

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
you you just couldn't play the game

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
and

79
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
um

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,840
like i grew up in a remote scottish

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
island so

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
i had a lot of time in the winter to try

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
and break this which i don't think i did

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
so the the concept

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
by the way just for the younger people

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,959
in the room yes apparently software used

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,040
to be loaded i remember it on tape it

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
does take a while and then the tape gets

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
stuck and then you have to go back to

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
the start and if it chewed the tape you

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,159
were goosed um so we had zero trust in

92
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,720
in the computer systems uh alan is is

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,319
the tape but when you're moving to it

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,120
um

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
how important is flexibility in in

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,959
building in

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,879
uh zero trust because i mean it sounds

98
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
very black and white either trust us you

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
don't but again that's not how we work i

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
think

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
i think if you're in the ideal scenario

102
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
of being a startup

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
or someone who's in a very clinically

104
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,200
standardized profile environment xero

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
trust would be

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
straightforward because you you it's

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
standardized we're a microsoft test

108
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
we're all in windows 10

109
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
we're all on you know certain types of

110
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
devices it's clean and simple

111
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
for the majority of us that's not the

112
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
real world and if we try to go black and

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,280
white inevitably you're going to shut

114
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
something down you're going to block uh

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
you're going to block a valid user

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,080
profiles from doing their work you're

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
going to shut the site down you're going

118
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,799
to shut a manufacturing site down you're

119
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,680
going to cost someone money so i think

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
fundamentally um

121
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
you know you have to start with

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
visibility of what your profiles are so

123
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,720
they're going back to like one of the

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
the common themes from the whole

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
sessions today has been about

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
the triad of process people technology

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
who are your user profile types

128
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
internally externally what's your data

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
where is it where are your assets and

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
who are your applications and then

131
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,919
what's the criticality and the risk

132
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,720
around those because even establishing

133
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
trust controls for for your network for

134
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
users it's still not black and white

135
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
trust the the level of trust you put on

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
a user or a device or an application has

137
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
to align with the risk associated so

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
just because you trust me doesn't mean i

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
can get into everything there are

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
gradients of evolving assurance verify

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
you said it you always need to verify so

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
i've logged in and i've logged in for my

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
normal device on my normal location i'm

144
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
in i'm in a new location i'm on a

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
different device do you trust me

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
straight out right no but

147
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
there's extra steps you go to

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
i was in a large manufacturing facility

149
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,639
that i can't name last week and uh i was

150
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
with the boss and the boss's pass opened

151
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,479
every door every door the entire

152
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
building the other person was with

153
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
only certain doors opened for them

154
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
because they didn't have clearance

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
it's like that in many ways isn't it and

156
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,960
and

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,639
you know when we do it to physical

158
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,800
infrastructure like that it's purely

159
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
logical that we do the same

160
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
with rit infrastructure absolutely but

161
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
again it goes back to it you can't rely

162
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,680
on one single control so you like that

163
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,919
you know even in physical security the

164
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,720
more

165
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
sensitive critical or

166
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
risk associated with what you're trying

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,280
to get into

168
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
there should be an evolving level of a

169
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,720
trust and assurance that you're looking

170
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
for so a badge that gets you into the

171
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,280
front door into the lobby fine you want

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
to get into the server room now you're

173
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
saying no you know do you do a bio check

174
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
there's again other biometrics so it's

175
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,000
you're still trusting the person but

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
you're just going to additional level of

177
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
assurance to approve that trust but

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
break that down to aegis like me right

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,479
um i i was when two-factor

180
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,759
authentication came in for everything i

181
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,000
was like mother of god how many times do

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
i have to do this

183
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
now it's second nature you know i wait

184
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
for the text the text comes through i

185
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,639
verify

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,800
you know that came through quite quickly

187
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
and egypt's got to understand it so you

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
know is is what's the gold standard here

189
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
if we're to get to zero trust because

190
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
two factors probably still can be beaten

191
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
so how do you do it two factors can be

192
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,639
beaten very easily because for a lot of

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
us when we enabled it first we were

194
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
hammering people with it to the point

195
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,039
where people got numb to the point of

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
your your phone was buzzing and you were

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,600
going yeah yeah just approve

198
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
not realizing that that wasn't coming

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,800
from you in the first place

200
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
so again the your your control policies

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
you need to know what you're protecting

202
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
and have the you know an opponent

203
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
intended you have to get visibility

204
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,000
about you know your user profiles you

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
have to get visibility of what data is

206
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
you're trying to get access to what

207
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
device types are in your ecosystem

208
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,000
because if you're if you don't have that

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
information

210
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
you are going to impact you're going

211
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,560
you're not going to be able to just say

212
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,639
this is a control policy i can apply and

213
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
this is universal to everyone you know

214
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
mfa is is a starting point but you know

215
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
in my world where i'm dealing with kind

216
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,800
of software applications ot environments

217
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
i'm talking about machine integrations

218
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
machine authentication mfa doesn't come

219
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
into my world you know so there's

220
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
there's elements of what's happening on

221
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,440
the network what's happening with our

222
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,720
production sites what's happening with

223
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
the software developing that's going

224
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
into cars

225
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,880
you know there's different types of

226
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,720
controls it has to go past things like

227
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
mfa absolutely it has to you have to

228
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,639
make it complicated unfortunately for

229
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
what you need to achieve in

230
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
you deal with pilots

231
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
lovely people

232
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
bit scattered sometimes um have to bring

233
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
technology with them have to be paired

234
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
with planes have to make sure that the

235
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
right person's in the right location and

236
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,960
carrying sensitive information asl in

237
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,919
particular because you're doing a lot of

238
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
cargo work and you can do cargo work

239
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
that could be sensitive for clients

240
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
how do you manage that how do you make

241
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
sure that the right pilot is on the

242
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
right device in the right location

243
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
without kind of really impinging on on

244
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
that individual's privacy i suppose we

245
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
well we wouldn't imprint on their

246
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,360
privacy but i i actually loved um

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,639
leslie who was here from microsoft

248
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
earlier on she gave the analogy that you

249
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,879
know information security should be like

250
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
airbags in a car

251
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,479
and i was thinking in my own company and

252
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,000
every company i've worked in i was kind

253
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
of thinking are we more like airbags in

254
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,280
the car you know that are there all

255
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,479
around us i couldn't even tell you how

256
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
many airbags there are in my car but i

257
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
know there's that they're there

258
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
are we kind of more like sand being

259
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
poured into the oil in the pet in the

260
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
engine that won't help the planes the

261
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
friction the friction um so to me it's

262
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
i think we we work on the bases that we

263
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
have you know pilots who start today in

264
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,440
dublin they'll move to the edge and and

265
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
they'll be using different devices and

266
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
they'll be in china tonight

267
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
and that's a huge challenge for us to be

268
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
able to

269
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,320
make sure that that individual is on

270
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
devices accessing resources

271
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
at a time that we would expect it to be

272
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
so so unfortunately we can't we can't

273
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
you know geo-bound anything because

274
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
people are just moving all over the

275
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
world on us and we can't kind of say you

276
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
know oh he'll only do this that the

277
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
other so it's a it's an enormous

278
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,839
challenge to say that these people

279
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
are allowed access these resources at

280
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
that time and it unfortunately for us as

281
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,880
well cargo moves at night so we're all

282
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
used to as

283
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
we're getting used to it again i think

284
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
as passengers in aviation we all fly

285
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,839
during the day cargo flies the other the

286
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,120
other side of the clock so we fly at

287
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
night so all of our activity is

288
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
occurring in the kind of night and the

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
anti-social hours yeah and that means

290
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
that all of this activity is happening

291
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
then which is when we're least generally

292
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
prepared to handle well the hsc attack

293
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
happened at four o'clock in the morning

294
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
for a reason so how do you identify your

295
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,839
users then what do you do like we've

296
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
talked about multiple systems

297
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,120
that are employed balance so how do you

298
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
do it oh and it would be very very

299
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,240
similar i think we're all using quite

300
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
common systems so we have multi-factor

301
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
authentication which they don't like

302
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
because you know every time they move

303
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,680
from an airport to the hotel it bleeps

304
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
again because it sees that they've moved

305
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
and it's that kind of stuff so it's zero

306
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,320
trust to me is is something that it's a

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
it's a an enormous

308
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
aspiration for us we have to make it

309
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,680
work but we're it's it's more of a

310
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
journey than it's a you know you can buy

311
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
five systems tick the box and zero trust

312
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
is implemented for you so we're on that

313
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
journey to actually make our knowledge

314
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
of where people are and what resources

315
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
they should be accessing at what point

316
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
in time much much better and integrate

317
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
that into our system so that if a pilot

318
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
logs on in china tonight we know she's

319
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
there because she was rastered to fly

320
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,120
there and that's okay so we go okay

321
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
that's that's good enough if she you

322
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
know suddenly pops up in cincinnati

323
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
where she's not supposed to be we're

324
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
kind of going well we should then throw

325
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
the images using the vpn to watch

326
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
something on nbc i mean there's another

327
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
thing that could happen yeah not on a

328
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,760
company devices

329
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
danny when it comes to zero trust again

330
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,320
you have the whole thing down right

331
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
you've got zero trust it's baked into

332
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,839
the system your people are fully versed

333
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
on it you guys are the zero trust

334
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
champions

335
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
but you're using software as a service

336
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
and you're using the cloud and

337
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
you know you don't have

338
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,800
control over external partners so how

339
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,320
does that work then how does xero trust

340
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
translate into how you deal with

341
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
external

342
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,160
suppliers if i could put them that way

343
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,959
yeah good question so this is

344
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
the industry that i'm in it's software

345
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
it's software in the cloud um and

346
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,959
you need to it comes down again to i

347
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
guess trust

348
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,600
to a certain extent and you need to be

349
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
able to trust the vendors that that you

350
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,959
work with

351
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
and

352
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
there's various different ways to to do

353
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,199
that but

354
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,160
certification is one of them so audits

355
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
third-party audits i'm making sure that

356
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
you have

357
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,760
the best

358
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
of breed that you're following best

359
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,959
practice and one way to show there's

360
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,079
always going to be a bit of blind faith

361
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,360
though isn't there that somebody

362
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,279
somewhere has okay fair enough they may

363
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,880
even the certified companies as we've

364
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,079
been hearing today they can also be

365
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
victim and fall foul of nefarious actors

366
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
yeah

367
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
absolutely and um

368
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
there are

369
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
technical controls that you can put in

370
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,000
place as well so making sure that um the

371
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,639
information that you bring into your

372
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,480
platform is verified

373
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
so for instance you you

374
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
you try and

375
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
eliminate the

376
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
the threat there by putting technical

377
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,480
controls in place

378
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,040
um if i can ask you alan about zero

379
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,920
trust being done badly i'm presuming

380
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,240
while there are best-in-class examples

381
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,680
yeah there are loads of people who've

382
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
done it airsways

383
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
yeah i think starting

384
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
and you probably started you said the

385
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
beginning donnie is is if you if you're

386
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
thinking of it as a technology rather

387
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
than a framework and a strategy and just

388
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
going in with i'm going to deploy

389
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
network access control i'm going to

390
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,399
deploy

391
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,959
you know technologies to enforce

392
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
controls without having done the due

393
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,000
diligence to understand what it is

394
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
what it is you're trying to control the

395
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
environment that you're trying to

396
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
control what level of uh impact that

397
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
kind of the zero controls you're looking

398
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
at putting in is going to do to your

399
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
business and operations then you are

400
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
inevitably going to become that you know

401
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,760
that

402
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
that number that comes with security as

403
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
being the blocker rather being an

404
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
enabler you're putting in something that

405
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
is is going to prevent someone from

406
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
doing the day-to-day job as opposed to

407
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
putting you know doing the due diligence

408
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
understanding the different use cases

409
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
you have what you're trying to protect

410
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,639
where it is and starting maybe starting

411
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,880
from not starting from zero trust but

412
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,560
starting from a a step of building to

413
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
that you know so you know there's some

414
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
probably simple baselines like just

415
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
switching on mfa things like that that

416
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
will

417
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
kind of get you some good baselines out

418
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
of the box but then starting to

419
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
understand well you have different

420
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,079
profiles with customers software

421
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
application services and you start

422
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,959
building up those and taking control

423
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,720
and applying

424
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,959
additional controls where it makes sense

425
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,279
but without kind of targeting a a one

426
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
size fits all um ian

427
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,199
we talked a lot about the human factor

428
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
today okay so

429
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
yes we can have technology in place we

430
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
can have practices in place we can we

431
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,760
can have everything locked down but

432
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
people are people at the end of the day

433
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
and

434
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
your devices that you are tracking so

435
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
carefully and that are binging when

436
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,639
people move locations and i was joking

437
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,079
about the netflix

438
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,360
but i'm sure

439
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
yeah yeah i'm sure people

440
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,760
use the device to look up something or

441
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
they might connect to a wi-fi that may

442
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
not be the wi-fi that they think it is

443
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
the vulnerability there in people is

444
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,279
is key isn't it um that that people they

445
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,959
don't set out to make a mistake but it

446
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
mistakes mistakes can happen how do you

447
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
bypass that when you're trying to put a

448
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
zero trust system in place i i think

449
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
there's two things one is there was that

450
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
great talk just before lunch about the

451
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
education of people you know bringing

452
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
using your team as your first line of

453
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,079
defense bringing them along with you the

454
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
second one then is going to be some

455
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
measure of technical control some

456
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
measure of alerting somebody so

457
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,000
people will respond in in my experience

458
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,199
in all the different businesses i've

459
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
worked in if you're collaborative if

460
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,639
you're working well with somebody and

461
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,000
you don't have a blame culture and

462
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
that's one of the best things i've seen

463
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,240
in aviation is that if there is an error

464
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
particularly you know in involving an

465
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,120
aircraft there's a no fault reporting

466
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,360
system in it so somebody can say look i

467
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
was making an approach into milan last

468
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,399
night and

469
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
it just came in too fast or too high and

470
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,399
i had to go around now that means they

471
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,320
kind of burned a load more fuel had to

472
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,759
go back around do a second approach and

473
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,240
they landed safely they can report that

474
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
in aviation with no problem whatsoever

475
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
but that's not something that translates

476
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
across entire sectors from our last

477
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,519
panel we found out you know the idea of

478
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
something going wrong whoops i'm going

479
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
to keep that to myself and probably make

480
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
it worse so we need to bring that into

481
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,759
that no blame culture so in within i.t

482
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,720
and information reporting within asl

483
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
we're rolling out the same thing tell us

484
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,920
if something bad happened tell us if you

485
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
think there was even something a bit

486
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
strange there's no issue whatsoever

487
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
because people are often very oh i did

488
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
this i clicked on that i feel a bit

489
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,519
stupid for it sort of thing and you go

490
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,199
no that's great thank you very much for

491
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,560
telling us this it's exactly the same

492
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
thing it's you know it's to give that no

493
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
blame kind of approach to people so that

494
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
they're then your allies rather than

495
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
they're worried about it going on the

496
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,560
record or the midcentured or you know

497
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,839
being well you can just spoil the end of

498
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,959
the series that they're watching on

499
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,480
netflix rather than that they won't have

500
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,000
to watch it anymore i've got to throw it

501
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
over to the floor if i can so any

502
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
questions for this panel on xero trust

503
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,880
so if you could just

504
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,959
put your hand up in the air and uh i

505
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,839
will come to you if you have any

506
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,600
questions bound to be questions on xero

507
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,320
trust yes sir

508
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,480
does that change

509
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,160
okay good question because that's what i

510
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,359
was trying to ask him you put it way

511
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,959
better than i did uh

512
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,760
you know

513
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,039
we all know about the fish tank in in

514
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,079
the casino okay um

515
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,799
we i for me i'm obsessed with this that

516
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,000
somehow

517
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
one of the one of the sas providers that

518
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
i use for my business is going to make

519
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,919
it back to something and i'm going to be

520
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,799
exposed are we are we taking that attack

521
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,120
service attack surface seriously

522
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
so to me okay um we should be absolutely

523
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
100

524
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,679
um you are

525
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,720
um

526
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,799
basically trusting somebody else with

527
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,160
your data

528
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
and

529
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,400
they

530
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,120
like

531
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
one thing for certain is you need to

532
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,400
understand where your data is

533
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
at all times and if you don't then you

534
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
you can protect it um but you also have

535
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
to have trust in the supplier that

536
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,039
you're that you're using so whatever

537
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,880
form that may take before you even

538
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,320
engage with a with any vendor you should

539
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
be going through a due diligence process

540
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,320
and that due diligence process should be

541
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
thorough and it's not just the case

542
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
these days of

543
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,039
um filling in a questionnaire

544
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,840
and then asking whether you're asking

545
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
them well let's face it we all still go

546
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,039
to the bottom and say we agree to the

547
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,400
terms and conditions without reading a

548
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
single one of them um the question is

549
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
whether we should be doing that when we

550
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,400
know that data is potentially being

551
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
exposed to risk exactly and you need to

552
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
be able to classify your data as well so

553
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,400
again it comes down to

554
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
what data are you willing to what data

555
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
are you willing to share with with those

556
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,559
uh with those vendors and

557
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
one way around that is to do

558
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,280
a thing called data minimization um so

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
only share the data that you actually

560
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,679
need

561
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,880
and if you don't have to share the likes

562
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
of pii

563
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
don't do that if there's no reason um

564
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
there are technical ways around it that

565
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,280
uh i can speak to you about later on but

566
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
um there's you know only shared the bare

567
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
minimum see and

568
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
there's a question that is in many ways

569
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,720
we're very trusting

570
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
of of sas providers aren't we um and and

571
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
maybe that trust isn't always earned

572
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
yeah and i think there's yeah we do we

573
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,320
don't want to set the expectation that

574
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
just because we're using sas service

575
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,640
that we've we've opened up full control

576
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
outside of our own capabilities the sas

577
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,039
service is still shared responsibility

578
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
at the end of the day the risky

579
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
accountability sits with you know the

580
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,160
company themselves it's their data

581
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
sitting out there so there has to be an

582
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
understanding that you can still look at

583
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
your organizational controls your

584
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,520
organizational technologies and still

585
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
extend them into sas so single sign-on

586
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
means you still control the access you

587
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
still apply your mfa you can have you

588
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
know there's concept of bring your own

589
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
key you're hosting my data but it's

590
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
encrypted with my keys so if you're

591
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
compromised

592
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,480
i hold the keys so so it's still locked

593
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
it's still locked out there but i hold

594
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,919
the key so in terms of exfiltration and

595
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,200
like then you've got to look up at your

596
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
controls well what is your backup

597
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
strategy so it comes down to those

598
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
shared responsibilities not knowing what

599
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
you have is knowing what you have and

600
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,120
what controls are you willing to

601
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,880
outsource and what controls do you want

602
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
to keep yourself even if you're

603
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,240
outsourcing the service itself as i'm

604
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
guessing you know the reason why

605
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
chainmail was effective if you were on

606
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,520
the back of a horse and someone was

607
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
coming at you was that there was lots of

608
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
different things tightened together if

609
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
you were just wearing a metal sheet it's

610
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
easier to penetrate it okay i get it now

611
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,880
i get it i fight the light bulb has gone
