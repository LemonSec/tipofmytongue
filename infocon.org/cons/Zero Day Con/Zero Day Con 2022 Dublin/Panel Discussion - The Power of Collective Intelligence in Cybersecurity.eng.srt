1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,640
um okay it's lovely to see you well

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,200
thank you very much for joining us um

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,639
and don't fall off the stage no one saw

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,000
that paul you're fine no i didn't

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,679
stumble okay

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,519
luka i'm going to talk uh to you first

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,640
of all i mean first of all really

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,680
interesting conversations that we're

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,960
having here what i love about going into

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
smart tech when i do get to when we go

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,160
to the office which hasn't been for a

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,519
while is that sense of team and

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
collegiality that you guys have in the

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,439
office that you bring there's no

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,440
individuals there there's teams

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,840
and and that collective intelligence is

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
really important to enable you to do

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,920
your job doesn't isn't it correct yeah

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,559
so collective intelligence is a concept

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,879
that i like very much and essentially it

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,879
is when a large group of people get

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
together to share knowledge to to solve

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
complex problems

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,280
so if you think of things like

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
understanding reflection taking action

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,719
taking a decision these are key elements

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
of cyber security but they're also key

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,359
elements of collective intelligence

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
and achieving collective intelligence

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,799
so

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,640
how do you achieve this and it's

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
actually very simple it just it's

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,479
something that has to be shared and

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
desired by the organization and although

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,159
it sounds simple

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,880
um very few organizations actually apply

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,720
the principle of collective intelligence

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
because it's different we're used to

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
thinking differently right you have your

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
own department you have your own project

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,920
you solve your own problems and that's

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
it right but collective intelligence is

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
a little bit different than that it's

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
it's when everybody comes together we

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
have an instinct

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
um in organizations to silo um that your

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
accounts your hr

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,600
your cyber security and it's like

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,119
ghostbusters if the streams cross

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
something catastrophic happens but

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
organizations that are most effective

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
have great cross purpose don't they and

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,759
exactly in cyber security that's

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,600
important because everybody is

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
vulnerable exactly i mean we have we

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
have instances when um everybody in the

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,560
country in the company contributes with

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,520
knowledge and and intelligence um

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
regardless of the problem you know even

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
if you're in accounting you might have a

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,200
perspective that's different to me

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
and sometimes you know when we're trying

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
to solve complex problems we bring

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
everybody together in the in that

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
exercise and it's amazing yeah and and

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,560
that in many ways uh leslie is important

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
because we we never underestimate human

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
intelligence um yes we're getting really

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,239
good at using artificial intelligence

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,840
and there's a purpose but human

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,519
intelligence will always have a place

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
won't it and it's always important that

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
we bring it together so we had a um a

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
person who came in and spoke to us at

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,280
microsoft a while ago right and he said

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
there's always that guy who wanders

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,879
around the building and you never quite

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,239
know back in the days when we used to be

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,680
able to get together right

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
and you never know what he's doing but

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
he is he is like a he's pollinating he's

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,599
cross-pollinating all these ideas

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
between these different um groups which

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,760
i think is amazing right um and so i

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
think

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
back to talking about human uh sorry

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
ai and machine learning um it's great to

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
use the technology to augment i'm going

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,840
to count the amount of times i say

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
amplify

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,599
and augment human intelligence right um

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
that but they are soft skills and i

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
think it's it's clear that we need to be

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,879
thinking about the communication the

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
collaboration

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
using the technology to do what the

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
technology does and does well but then

98
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,440
thinking about the human components

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
which are those soft skills which that's

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,720
never going to do for us

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
yeah and and

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
we can sometimes forget that can't we

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
that those soft skills when we're

104
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,239
talking about you know machines can do

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
this and you can have software to do

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
that

107
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
we need people at the end of the day we

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,239
and we need to trust people i know we

109
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,280
talked about zero trust there a minute

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
ago but we need to trust the individuals

111
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
to come up with solutions

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
well it's interesting because zero trust

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
i always think is it's not necessarily

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,239
that uh we talked about empathy right so

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
zero trust and empathy does that go

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
together from a language perspective i'm

117
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,480
not sure um but i do think um

118
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
you know there is a degree of uh again

119
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
allowing the technology to do what it's

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
good at patent detection looking at you

121
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
know a huge amount of of um signal very

122
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
quickly um but in any case if you're

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,360
talking about humans again there's that

124
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,720
gut feel when you know if you've been

125
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,239
doing an investigation um from a

126
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,840
security perspective for as many years

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,079
as i have right well you can't treat you

128
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,918
can't train gut feel into machine

129
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
learning right you still need the mark

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,479
on human eyeball but you then get the

131
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,560
capability of having it take care of the

132
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,080
vast majority of the noise and then you

133
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
do something over the top yeah exactly

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,800
but it used to be referred to as the

135
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
donkey work uh the machines can do the

136
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
junkie work and the humans can again

137
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
rise above it paul i remember years ago

138
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
going into an organization

139
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
that um i like most organizations that i

140
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
go into i didn't understand what they

141
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
did it was in the finance sector right

142
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,280
and

143
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
uh i got a tour and there was these

144
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
little side rooms and in each of those

145
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
side rooms uh there was little teams

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
working they were beavering away there

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,919
was white boards and there was colors

148
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,440
and it was all very exciting and i

149
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
remember asking what goes on in those

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
rooms i'm thinking was it some part of

151
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
the sales process or what was it no

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
that's our problem-solving rooms where

153
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
we bring people together from each of

154
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,479
the teams we lock them in a room and

155
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
they don't come out until they have a

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
solution and i thought that was

157
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
beautifully simplistic um

158
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
as life got more complicated have we

159
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
have some businesses lost that

160
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
simplicity i mean ibm was brought in to

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
make things simple

162
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
but did we lose a little bit along the

163
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
way not necessarily ibm but did we

164
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
collectively lose a little bit along the

165
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
way yeah well i think there's a

166
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
tremendous amount of complacency in in

167
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,039
the industry

168
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,199
generally in industries um

169
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,759
i i think the disagreement with the the

170
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
panel discussion tile is i think the

171
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
potential

172
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,360
of collective intelligence is huge i i

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
think we struggle today

174
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
to really see it fully deployed i think

175
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
organizations are so complex so

176
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
distributed

177
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,840
and

178
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,600
requiring such pockets of expertise it's

179
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
very difficult to bring together

180
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
all of those who have the the real

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
either experience of having done it

182
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,319
before

183
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
or the innovation if you will to to try

184
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
new things and i think it's a big

185
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,520
barrier i i talk to many

186
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
organizations who are

187
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
really looking to

188
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
simplify as quickly as possible because

189
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,319
simplification will allow for

190
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,039
the more power of intelligence and i

191
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
think the the complexity in many

192
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
organizations

193
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,919
architectures is really stifling

194
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
how we can leverage into the the very

195
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,639
rich intelligence that's out there i

196
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,639
think intelligence is either

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
an indicator of a threat where you have

198
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,000
to go investigate you spend the time it

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
can be across

200
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
many many different systems where you

201
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,400
need skills and expertise or it can be

202
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
the moments where you've done it before

203
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,759
and you've seen it before which allows

204
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,960
you to bring

205
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,919
that value to the force multipliers so

206
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,639
so

207
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
very long-winded answer but i i think

208
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,759
the

209
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,520
simplification is probably one of the

210
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,599
biggest challenges we face in terms of

211
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
really harnessing

212
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
some of the intelligence that is really

213
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
out there when we

214
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
we look at the hiring landscape at the

215
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
moment it's complicated for everybody

216
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
i'm pretty sure any business who's

217
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
trying to recruit right now knows how

218
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,840
hard it is we know in cyber security how

219
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
exceptionally hard it is to hire people

220
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,199
it's holding on to what you have as

221
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,080
opposed to anything else um is is that a

222
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
challenge as well when you're trying to

223
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,319
drive this message home that you have

224
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,680
the right people in the right position

225
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,000
so it's great having a policy policies

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
are great but don't have the people to

227
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
implement that and simplify it that

228
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
policy is going to fail yeah i i think

229
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
yes it's

230
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
everyone in this room will testify that

231
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
it's a huge issue

232
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
i think the issue isn't the people

233
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
the issue is the technology

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
i think we've seen just an explosion

235
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
of different types of technologies many

236
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
doing the same things

237
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
not necessarily deployed the right way

238
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
not necessarily driving the value that

239
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
was perhaps anticipated and that's as i

240
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
said before become a real

241
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,440
uh constraint on new talent new

242
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
workforce actually leveraging that and

243
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,199
then leave i will come to you just a

244
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,599
moment but i mean is that where

245
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
managers are important we don't know

246
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,199
what a bad manager does a bad manager

247
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
sits across a problem blames everybody

248
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
gets nothing done a good manager might

249
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
listen to someone who's in a junior role

250
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
who's after identifying something

251
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
that then can be rolled out i mean i

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,560
know again another company that does

253
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
that really really well they've got a

254
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
forum whereby people can stick their

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
hand up will be listened to if they have

256
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,399
a good idea it's escalated throughout

257
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,080
the entire company and there are other

258
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,519
companies in the same field that have

259
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,679
zero opportunity for people on the floor

260
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,719
to do that

261
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,159
you know that it comes down to

262
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
management at the end of the day isn't

263
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
it and those processes yeah i

264
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,360
i think managers part of my job in in

265
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,600
ibm is is creating

266
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
environments where there is a certain

267
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,959
amount of patience

268
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,200
we live in a very demanding world you

269
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,399
know whether it's

270
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,320
you know delivering a project to time

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
whether it's sales whatever it might be

272
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,399
there's always timelines there's always

273
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,800
deadlines there's always pressure

274
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
i think the

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
any change program particularly in cyber

276
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,279
if you're talking about simplifying

277
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,120
infrastructure that's taken years to

278
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
deploy it's going to take years to

279
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
simplify and i think our jobs to

280
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,519
encourage

281
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
and to help our new workforce be

282
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,399
resilient is to build in

283
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
patients so they can thrive um

284
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
for those who aren't from ireland most

285
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,959
people do live here but we've many

286
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
visitors as well sorry to lead on about

287
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
the hse thing but nev yeah i want to

288
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
talk to you about active learning okay

289
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,680
um active learning is really important

290
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
you learn from either your own mistakes

291
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
or the mistakes of others

292
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,399
probably have a very different

293
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,800
conversation at this event had we not

294
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
had the hsc attack and there was real

295
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,839
active learning uh post the hsc attack

296
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,480
for every organization big and small and

297
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
it it it went down as was pointed out

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
from the people charged with cyber

299
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
security and charged with uh with you

300
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
with implementing changes right down to

301
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,240
the people who are at the bottom of the

302
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
tree how important is that act of

303
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,800
learning in in this ongoing cyber

304
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
security battle and i think active

305
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,000
learning is also a bad experience so you

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
know i'm working in information security

307
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
now 22 years

308
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
i was the youngest female in ireland to

309
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
qualify in it so

310
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,240
i think over the course of the 22 years

311
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,079
we've always been about protecting

312
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,959
information assets data and systems and

313
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,760
so while the technology has changed the

314
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
controls and the frameworks are still

315
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
there so

316
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
um i think it's setting the tone from

317
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,240
the top in the organization the act of

318
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
learning people learn in different ways

319
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
we all process change in in different

320
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
ways too

321
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,200
so i kind of compare it to um the dublin

322
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
team the six and the row team they had a

323
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
highly performing team but you know that

324
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,839
was probably more

325
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
that is that the angry cork that's a

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
great point not anymore because they

327
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
didn't feel the next generation so

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,760
that's where it comes into active

329
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
learning and so it's how we all are

330
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,360
transferring our knowledge and skill set

331
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,240
as leaders onto the next generation and

332
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
that is looking at you know the people

333
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,079
the processes and the technologies

334
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,519
what i love about your story is that you

335
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,560
know that

336
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
let's face it it was tricky enough i'd

337
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
imagine uh for a woman to break through

338
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,160
22 years ago right and and it's it's

339
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
still hard to do you know how i broke

340
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,800
through uh rosenick defrauded the aib

341
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
bank and they needed somebody to get

342
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,399
into the security team so i learned that

343
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
way and yeah i had to travel abroad to

344
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
take my exams so you see you seized the

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,560
opportunity that arose but didn't they

346
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
were grateful for it um one of the key

347
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,000
challenges always will be

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,959
when you're looking at a younger

349
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,240
generation yep there's always someone

350
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
better than you like speak to a good

351
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
teacher a teacher will always say that

352
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
they want their pupils to be better at

353
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
the subject than they ever were it's not

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,279
about ego

355
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,839
ego is a huge inhibitor in this space

356
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,120
isn't it i

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
totally agree with you

358
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
and so

359
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
any good leader knows that you surround

360
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,839
yourself by good

361
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
by good people and it's how you build

362
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
that trust in your people so every day i

363
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
have a daily stand up with my team and

364
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,639
you know we're talking about and how

365
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,120
we're moving fenergo forward but we're

366
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,600
laughing about it so it's enjoyable it's

367
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
driving the passion and it spells in the

368
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,399
trust that the junior member on my team

369
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,720
can ask me a question or bring an idea

370
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
to me and so if you don't make yourself

371
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
available how

372
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,360
are you going to hear those and great

373
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
ideas and be able to access them to move

374
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
companies forward

375
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
and it's funny somebody who recently

376
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,079
just joined my team they said i've never

377
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
met the cso before i've only ever sent

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,720
them

379
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
an email on a monthly basis around

380
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
access control reviews so i'm like how

381
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,920
are we

382
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,959
really developing our people to solve

383
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
the complex situations that we are all

384
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,680
facing in our businesses well look at

385
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
closed doors are a huge problem um if

386
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,519
your door is closed you're not open to

387
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,120
the people on the other side

388
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
and and that and that's something that

389
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
that is a constant challenge we've also

390
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,560
had the challenge in the last two years

391
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
of not everybody being in the same

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
location now

393
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
company like yours you've got different

394
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
locations so you're you were already

395
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,639
kind of set up for that but how

396
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,440
important is it that you have got

397
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
that connection with the team and and

398
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
the ability for everybody to pitch in

399
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,639
in the good and the bad

400
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
very very important um very similar to

401
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,480
what you were saying neve

402
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
we have

403
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
a similar philosophy in our company

404
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,639
where

405
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,360
we have to be able to communicate more

406
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
communicate better and um it was i it

407
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
was challenging at the beginning of the

408
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,839
pandemic because we just didn't know

409
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,440
what was going to happen

410
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
everybody had to work remotely we were

411
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,639
coming in to the office now and then um

412
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
but we made it work and it it's

413
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
sometimes it's small things like making

414
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,279
sure that you've got your five-minute

415
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,680
coffee break chat with somebody um

416
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,600
having your tea and coffee breaks here

417
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
and there checking in with the team all

418
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
the time setting up one-to-one meetings

419
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
with every single person that reports

420
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,000
into you that's really really important

421
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
and keeping that culture of

422
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,160
collaboration and openness because you

423
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
know we're all

424
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
shall we say a little experience on the

425
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,160
panel um we all knew what it was like to

426
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
get stuck in the lift of the boss

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
um and i just wonder is that is that an

428
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
experience that was robbed from people

429
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
in the last two years particularly those

430
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
coming in that they never had the

431
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
opportunity to be stuck in the lift to

432
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
introduce themselves to say actually i

433
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,839
have an idea about something there do

434
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,639
you mind if i've 100 i mean we're hiring

435
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,839
like crazy at the moment so we're

436
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
getting a lot of new people every single

437
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
week

438
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,959
and um because we're back into into the

439
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,519
office on a hybrid model i can

440
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
definitely see the difference in the

441
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
people that i'm hiring these days

442
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
compared to people that i was hiring you

443
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,800
know a year ago when they all had to be

444
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,639
on board remotely and

445
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
there are people that i haven't even met

446
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
in person actually met them today for

447
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
the first time

448
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
at zero decant and there's a huge

449
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,279
difference because um

450
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
you you bond differently

451
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,160
um every effective organization has to

452
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,959
be diverse to the challenges that come

453
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,959
through um i mentioned the fact that

454
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
cyber security has traditionally been

455
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,959
a very male dominated practice a little

456
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,920
bit i'm dancing delicately here um

457
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
that doesn't reflect the reality of the

458
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,320
customers that you're serving either

459
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
how do we make those teams more diverse

460
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,240
how do we make sure that we have got the

461
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
right mix in there

462
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,680
to meet the challenge that's coming

463
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,800
because there's a challenge coming and

464
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,639
that team has to be there to meet it

465
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,839
yeah that's a great question i mean i

466
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,040
think we just have to think about

467
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,000
diversity a little bit differently and

468
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,160
it's an important element and if you

469
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
think about

470
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,560
demographic diversity nationality age

471
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,199
and so forth

472
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
gender that's important too but what's

473
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,360
more important is cognitive diversity we

474
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
need people who can think differently

475
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
people who have different experiences

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,320
who come from different places

477
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
because we're moving away from that

478
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,560
fixed mindset of you know solving

479
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
problems

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,800
so

481
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,839
we need cognitive diversity we need a

482
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,920
growth mindset in order to tackle the

483
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
the challenges that we're facing and and

484
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,160
foster innovation um we've never had as

485
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,720
much information leslie at our ex at our

486
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
disposal than we have right now i mean

487
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,959
it's a it's a sea of information um that

488
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
we could easily drown in if if we didn't

489
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,279
know how to look through it

490
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
how important is it to get the right

491
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
information to the right people to to

492
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
extract that collective intelligence so

493
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
that people

494
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
might see something that others don't

495
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,480
see you know it communication became

496
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,399
hard and easy in the last two years but

497
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,920
how important is getting information to

498
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,199
people to pull on that collective

499
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,680
intelligence well really um great

500
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
question um i would say so i was talking

501
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,920
to desiree who was talking about otnit

502
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,839
right we're talking about culture

503
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,319
um and again a lot of it is thinking

504
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,559
about the convergence of ot with it and

505
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
i don't necessarily see that because i

506
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,599
think it's across the great cultural

507
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,079
divide right we've got we clearly know

508
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,599
that the adversaries can go from one

509
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,280
side to the other okay

510
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,160
um

511
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
and i think it's about if you if you're

512
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,919
in the stock so if we could get all of

513
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
that signal to some place that's the one

514
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
place all right that doesn't necessarily

515
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,919
mean to say that that's the right place

516
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
for somebody to do something about it

517
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
okay so we've got to get the signal to

518
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,080
the right person who knows uh what to do

519
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
with that information but you know in

520
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
terms of the culture i think that's the

521
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
big challenge the technology is one

522
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,520
thing it's a it's obviously you know

523
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,120
technology does change we talk to the

524
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
innovator's dilemma because it changes

525
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,880
every 10 years but

526
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
with people being able to use that

527
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
technology and that people process

528
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
technology information thing that we're

529
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
all talking about

530
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,679
it's key to uh to be thinking about it

531
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
from a cultural perspective and and

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
getting people to work together and i

533
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
think that that human interaction is

534
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
good i i don't know about anybody else

535
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
but i went from traveling all the time

536
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,039
to no travel at all and then my work

537
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,880
life took off because i was forever

538
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
behind the desk talking to people and

539
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,799
now i'm hearing in fact that it's

540
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,120
difficult for people who've now been

541
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,799
at home for such a long time and now

542
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,080
they're used to it to actually thinking

543
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
about going back into the office so

544
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,000
these are all you know the human factors

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
amazing people it's a nightmare i mean

546
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
it was great i didn't have to meet

547
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
anybody i just sat looking at my mac

548
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,440
right

549
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,320
um paul in many ways what i what i found

550
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
interesting about ian's point about zero

551
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
blame in aviation

552
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,919
uh that you want to get the reports you

553
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
want the information to come through

554
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
when it comes to cyber security you have

555
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
to assume a breach you have to assume

556
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,760
that something has gone wrong is it

557
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
harder to motivate people in that

558
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,960
scenario like how do you celebrate

559
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,559
success and failure in cyber security

560
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
when you know inevitably something has

561
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
to go wrong for you to be tested

562
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
no i

563
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
we talked about information just i think

564
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
the problem in cyber security is there's

565
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
too much data

566
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
you know we don't actually have enough

567
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,000
really actionable intelligence

568
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
and and it's very interesting because it

569
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
you need that resiliency from people

570
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
wherever they're from whatever their

571
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,640
background

572
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
resiliency is key because

573
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,320
you know the the

574
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,799
being inquisitive is is essential in

575
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,600
cyber security you need to want to fix

576
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,039
problems

577
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,799
and and the problem

578
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,880
we face right now is there's so much

579
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,919
data

580
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,440
there's potentially so many different

581
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
opinions getting to the crux to actual

582
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
information that you can make decisions

583
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
on is incredibly difficult

584
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
so having that mindset you know reluca

585
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,240
talked about growth mindset

586
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,200
i think

587
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,919
probably more so than anywhere in in

588
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,039
it in in the industry generally if you

589
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,200
don't have that mindset of of being able

590
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,080
to take defeat go again you know get to

591
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
those wins where a win could be proving

592
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
that an indicator of compromise has not

593
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,919
hit your infrastructure that's a win

594
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,000
right it doesn't have to be always the

595
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
the kind of big end game major incident

596
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
where everything's down i think you just

597
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
to you know create that culture like

598
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,080
you've talked about where there's

599
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,799
ongoing interaction at all levels of the

600
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,080
organization so everyone has a voice and

601
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
everyone can contribute to the outcome

602
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,760
yeah but how do you deal with the

603
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
inevitable failure because you'd like to

604
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
think that you guys are going to have

605
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,840
the shield up every time and you know

606
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,919
people come to you with a problem when

607
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,840
you are the people that come that the

608
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,679
problem comes in the door to you they're

609
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
at a low point your teams have to deal

610
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
with that sometimes they're going to be

611
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
at a low point too how do you bring them

612
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
back out of that and

613
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
and help them fight the next fight it's

614
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,799
resilience you know i think root cause

615
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,159
is a key kind of dynamic in our industry

616
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,559
you know any incident that happens major

617
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,200
or minor you know a good root cause

618
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
allows everyone to take a breath

619
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
understand the improvements that need to

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
be made and come out of it stronger and

621
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,360
better

622
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
i think we

623
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
i see varying degrees of quality and

624
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
root cause analysis but yeah a good root

625
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,480
cause in any incident allows the team

626
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
to just reinvigorate understand where

627
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,280
there were gaps and and go again never

628
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
i'm going to again tread in dodgy ground

629
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,360
we talked about diversity but there's

630
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
also diversity in age profile in

631
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,400
organizations

632
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,600
younger

633
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
members of the team have a very

634
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,840
different approach to older members of

635
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
the team it's just the nature there's a

636
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
generational shift which is something

637
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
that has to be acknowledged and has to

638
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,919
be understood and sometimes it's kind of

639
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,280
hard for

640
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
people who are in their 40s and 50s to

641
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
work out what the heck is going through

642
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
the head of a 20 year old how have you

643
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
managed that and how and how how do you

644
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
recommend managing that and i was saying

645
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
i say take your cybersecurity passion

646
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
and i'll make it happen i feel it

647
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,200
because i i see it as as a way

648
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
and to help us grow and be better with

649
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,080
our defenses

650
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,880
and obviously you want to

651
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
create a career path for that person to

652
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
grow and that's looking at it from a

653
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,760
business perspective so whatever

654
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
industry

655
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
and that you're operating in that they

656
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
understand the business the technical

657
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
side is around their their cyber

658
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
security skill set so do they want to go

659
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
into forensics incident response risk

660
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,799
management and then the professional

661
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,280
piece and i have seen this and

662
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,039
throughout my career where people

663
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,440
because of their technical and security

664
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
skill set they move up in the org

665
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
very quickly but they haven't developed

666
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
that business risk

667
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,880
professionalism to be put and present in

668
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,520
in front of c-suite or boards

669
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,679
so it's really making sure the career

670
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
path covers all three aspects so that

671
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
they can reach their goal and just

672
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,039
building on what paul said there and

673
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,799
people working in cyber security that

674
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,880
move up to the organization very quickly

675
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
with that haven't got that experience

676
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
they a lot of them alright have left the

677
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
industry now and because of the stress

678
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
and the pressure and the resilience they

679
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,320
haven't built in the right mechanisms or

680
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,480
have the right development that protect

681
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,679
them that way yeah because the

682
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,880
protection is important you need to

683
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
protect everyone needs to be protected

684
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,520
particularly when they're they're

685
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
working in in jobs that are hard and

686
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
this is a hard job uh to finish up with

687
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
this panel uh before we bring ronan back

688
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,640
up to to close their deck on 2022

689
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
i want to just ask for you know everyone

690
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,600
has fantasy football everybody has a

691
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
dream team

692
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,919
what do you think makes that dream team

693
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
in cyber security and how how it best

694
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,200
will bring out that collective

695
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,320
intelligence reluca you're going to tell

696
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,640
me smart attack 24 7 already has it but

697
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
tell us what yeah what is the secret

698
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,360
sauce well i think um one of the most

699
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,520
important elements is diversity again

700
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
having a diverse team having people on

701
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
the team who think differently

702
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,799
and not all think the same and

703
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,039
trust is is really important in that as

704
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,919
well

705
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,320
and

706
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,799
being open with each other

707
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,880
um leslie oh i'm just going to go with

708
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
what my esteemed colleague said

709
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,240
can i phone a friend

710
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
i think um honestly it's it's a little

711
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,720
bit like trying to devolve the elitist

712
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
attitude that we see right and i think

713
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,919
if you've been in the security industry

714
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,200
for such a long time you've built up

715
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
that language of security so to your

716
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,039
point everything with reverse mentoring

717
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,240
to make sure that you've got somebody

718
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,559
who's um coming in with new ideas those

719
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,440
ideas are heard um to maybe breaking

720
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,400
down

721
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,120
the

722
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,039
the strata that's

723
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,400
developed over the years so that you've

724
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
got people who can be you know part of

725
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
the team very quickly and back to your

726
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,039
point about trust and and um

727
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
communication yeah actually human skill

728
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,720
and i think you have to forget about

729
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
hierarchies as well i mean we can all

730
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,799
contribute to something and you have to

731
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,400
be able to bring in

732
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,039
your um all of your teams together

733
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
regardless of whether you're their

734
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,679
manager because

735
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,480
i can also learn so much from from the

736
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,919
people i work with and the people that

737
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,799
work directly for me so i think

738
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
having that open mindset is really

739
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
really important what's the secret sauce

740
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,039
for you paul

741
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,760
well i i think increasingly

742
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
you know diversity whether it's youth or

743
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,000
others is bringing an incredible energy

744
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
and passion to our industry and

745
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,919
you know our job is to harness

746
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,720
all of that to the benefit of

747
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
clients organizations and in some

748
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
instances nation states right where

749
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
that collective

750
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,480
uh energy drives you know really

751
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
reducing some of the big risks we all

752
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
face and and it's critical that you know

753
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
aggregation of those skills and

754
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
resources happen so we all benefit leave

755
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,840
for you

756
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
and like what my panelists all said but

757
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
another thing for me was willing to take

758
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
the hit so

759
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
that the team know

760
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
that you have their back and your you

761
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
know you support them in the decisions

762
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,039
that they make

763
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,679
and i think that's what um really

764
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,520
is the grinding i'm coming back

765
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
listening to this group right and i'm

766
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
coming back to the same point i work in

767
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
broadcasting a lot of the time

768
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
where let's just describe it as a big

769
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
massive ego fest right and and that

770
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,679
works right throughout every single

771
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,440
organization and there's always someone

772
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
at fault there's always someone to blame

773
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,799
is never anyone's responsibility what

774
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,000
you guys are telling me is that doesn't

775
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
work in cyber security that you have to

776
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
park the ego at the door you have to i

777
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,039
mean there's a lot of ego in cyber

778
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,279
security and you have to find a way to

779
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,279
park it because it just doesn't go yeah

780
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,360
um we all we all share the same

781
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,159
experience we all have the same goal and

782
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,880
ego can only hinder that being the

783
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
biggest bull doesn't solve the problem

784
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,240
cyber is is really fronting many

785
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,279
different

786
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,840
uh organizations in a client or a nation

787
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,480
itself you know and and often

788
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
cyber security csos are blamed for

789
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,799
weaknesses within after the event legacy

790
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,120
infrastructures and and i think maybe to

791
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,919
close on on the point i think

792
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
cyber security has brought absolute

793
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,400
awareness to

794
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,640
really the work needed to modernize to

795
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,960
transform to bring up to standards in

796
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
many cases a lot of the infrastructure

797
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,520
that's out there so i see cyber is a

798
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,440
great change agent

799
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,760
in just the the industry generally and

800
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,520
and long may it continue yeah and keep

801
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
hiring guys because uh you need more and

802
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,720
you're gonna need a lot more by the

803
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,919
sounds because we have a huge round of

804
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
applause please for nia for luca paul

805
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
and leslie we'll leave you go that side

806
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,080
folks thank you very much indeed

807
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
