1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,000
how's everybody today hi i'm james lane

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
i'm a social uh solutions engineer with

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
treadlocker um

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
solutions engineer not a public speaker

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,640
so you'll have to excuse me um as we go

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
through this today i want to start

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,240
discussing why we should be adopting a

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,160
zero trust architecture when it comes to

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,000
our environments okay

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
so we'll start off at the beginning okay

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
we'll talk about software

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
okay software is what we use every day

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,520
typically we use it generally every

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
single day we've got our office

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
applications browsers

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,760
um acrobat readers foil sharing

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
applications that's what we use on our

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
machines okay the software is also used

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,399
in operating theaters

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,719
airplane tracking ambulances it's even

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,199
used in rockets okay

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
to say about software the possibilities

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
when it comes to software are actually

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
endless okay

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
we can use them anywhere we like and

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
and use them in that way

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,320
but

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
when it comes to software those

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,600
possibilities are also

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,119
potentially

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
bad for us too

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
right so the reason for that is

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
is that

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,479
at the end of the day

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
malware is software

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,000
what's the difference

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
it's just code

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
all it is is code that's been developed

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
and executed within an environment

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,960
there's nothing that says whether it's

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,240
good or bad

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,920
depending on what sort of defense you're

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
on the outcome is either good or bad

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
okay

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
and when it comes to malware we're going

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
to talk about malware today and where

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
malware came about

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,400
okay

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
like the facts are about when we when we

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,600
look at malware itself

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,799
540 000

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
pieces of malware are detected every

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,079
single day

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
every day

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
there's over a billion pieces of malware

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
out there

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
out there every single day

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
every minute

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
at least four businesses

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,119
are victims of malware and ransomware

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,479
today

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,280
so

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,038
what can we do and say about malware

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,479
when you look at the actual history of

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
malware okay

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,920
the early stages of malware were very

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,800
simple

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
okay

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
very very simple

70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,280
all they were

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
were things that popped up on your

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
screen they actually said used to say

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
you know silly stuff about bill gates

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
but that's all they did

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
but malware then evolved into what we

76
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
know as ransomware

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,040
okay

78
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
and with ransomware if you look at the

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,879
history of ransomware where it all

80
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,080
started was

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
was in 1989

82
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
that's how far back it starts the aids

83
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
trojan as it's known

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
okay

85
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,760
in 1989 this would infect your machine

86
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
after 90 cycles as in after 90 restarts

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
of your machine

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
it would start encrypting your file

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,319
names

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,640
now this is well before we had

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
bitcoin and everything else like we do

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
today

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
and the result of getting this actual

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
ransomware off your machine

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
was to send 189

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
to a po box in panama

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
that's what the solution was

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,280
now

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
the actual developer of this ransomware

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,720
joseph pep

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
was obviously later on caught up and was

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
arrested because of this

103
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
obviously using the po box

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
and but that was the first documented

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
ransomware

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
then it started to evolve and

107
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,280
traditionally what ransomware was it

108
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
would infect your machine and just your

109
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,879
machine so it was kept unique to that

110
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
endpoint as such

111
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
but then that's sort of evolving

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
and in 2017 we've seen a new type of

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,599
ransomware which was the wannacroi

114
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
so the wannacry ransomware had the

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,480
ability to spread across networks

116
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
infecting other machines and encrypting

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
each and every machine within that

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
environment

119
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
it propagated true networks using the

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,040
eternal blue

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
um

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,959
and

123
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
we reckon that it was actually developed

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
in north korea

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
that's what they think

126
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,759
but the damage of this was completely

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,079
different to what we had before okay

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
because of its ability to spread

129
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
now

130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,080
we start evolving then even further

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
most of you in the room should have

132
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
heard about this

133
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
already

134
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,520
if anybody hasn't heard about this

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
on the 14th of may 2021 a couple of

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,720
months into the um pandemic

137
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
what happened

138
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
the hse was taken down

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
it was the canti v3 attack that caused

140
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,400
it

141
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
it used power shell to send their cobalt

142
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,759
strike beacons within the network

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,919
it used powershell to delete shadow

144
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,720
copies of all of the backups

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
it used powershell and wmic to download

146
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
payloads and infect each and every

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,680
machine in the hse as you all may know

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,960
the hse resulted back to pen and paper

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
canceling all of their appointments at

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,600
the time

151
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
and and just the complete network was

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
shut down

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
it took them three months to get the

154
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
primary systems back up in september

155
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,039
and they're still going on i did read an

156
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
article last week i think it we're into

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
a cost of over 110 million

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,199
from this attack on the agency

159
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,560
and this is where

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,720
ransomware has evolved

161
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
okay

162
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
when you look at ransomware in the

163
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
traditional sense

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
the wannacry

165
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
before that

166
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
they would infect your machine

167
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
they would hold you to ransom

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,680
but that sort of has changed now

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,639
not only do they infect your machine now

170
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,840
they now

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
exfiltrate your data

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
so a recent study by codeware

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
reckons over 70

174
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
of attacks

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
will have exfiltrated data

176
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,240
in other words they're going to take

177
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
your data and whether you pay the ransom

178
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
or not you're not sure whether that data

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,080
is ever going to be destroyed

180
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
so if it is sensitive company

181
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,120
information

182
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
you have no guarantee that you're ever

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
going to get that data back or it's

184
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
going to be successfully destroyed

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
that's the way ransomware where has

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
evolved so gunner the days in 2014 when

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
we got encrypted

188
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,639
we would just

189
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
use a backup restore our systems and

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
we're back to normal

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
that's gone and that's changed

192
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
and the way

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
the tread actors work these days has

194
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
changed as well

195
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
so instead of attacking

196
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,880
just individual organizations or going

197
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
after individuals

198
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
they've changed the way they actually

199
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
deliver ransomware

200
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
now they're using the tools that we use

201
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
every day to manage our endpoints

202
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
okay remote management tools

203
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,520
they're using them to actually deliver

204
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
the ransomware

205
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,199
they're using

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,039
vulnerabilities that they find within

207
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,639
our operating systems and they're going

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
to exploit all of them

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
but they don't always have to use

210
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
vulnerabilities

211
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,319
because they can also use what we call

212
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,400
living off the land

213
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
and living off the land means they can

214
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
use the applications that are already

215
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
installed on our machines

216
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,199
powershell command prompt both can be

217
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,400
used

218
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,039
to exfiltrate your data you can upload

219
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
your files using powershell a power

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
simple power circuit member

221
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
run dll another application built into

222
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
your system

223
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
can actually run code from github

224
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
in protected memory so it cannot be

225
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,960
scanned

226
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,879
it's not actually doing anything on your

227
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
machine

228
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
this is how they have changed and they

229
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
have evolved

230
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,840
okay

231
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
so what do we do about it and how can we

232
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
solve this problem

233
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
well if we look at what we're doing

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
about it at the moment

235
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
this is what we're doing

236
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
we've got antiverses avs threat hunting

237
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,879
scanning scanning scanning

238
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,199
we're looking for the bad guys in our

239
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
environment

240
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
and we're learning these

241
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,760
applications on top of each other

242
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,919
but the problem is is that

243
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,640
none of these will take account for zero

244
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
day attacks

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
they're going on by what they know

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
already

247
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,640
it's like

248
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
having a house alarm with lasers

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
and the best of everything security

250
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
cameras and everything and then going

251
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
out and leaving the front door open

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
it's just not working

253
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
we know it's not working

254
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
so

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,839
what can we do about this

256
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
what can you do about it not working how

257
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,120
can we stop this and stop being victims

258
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
of ransomware and of these threats the

259
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
zero-day trusts

260
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
okay

261
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
so

262
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
when we look at it and we look at what

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
we're currently using we know that it's

264
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,240
not working

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
so

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
where's the solution

267
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,160
i want to introduce you to what we call

268
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,040
the triangle the security triangle okay

269
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
the security triangle is very simple

270
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,160
on the left here what we can see is what

271
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,480
we're doing already

272
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,959
we're doing our scanning

273
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,240
we're checking for our known

274
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
vulnerabilities we're doing everything

275
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
that we know okay

276
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
on the bottom here is our security

277
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,959
awareness training

278
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,040
okay to teach users

279
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,680
about being aware

280
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
now

281
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
no matter how successful you are a

282
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
security awareness training

283
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
there's always going to be a doors and

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
accounts that's going to click on silly

285
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
links and installs them

286
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
so you can't always rely on that

287
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,360
where most people fall down is is on the

288
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
right hand side

289
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
which is where our controls are

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
if these are the things that control

291
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
what can and cannot happen in our

292
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
environment

293
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
the most successful way of mitigating

294
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
against efficient attack

295
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
is multi-factor authentication

296
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,120
it's very simple

297
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
whether somebody puts in credentials or

298
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
not

299
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
with multi-factor authentication you're

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
eliminating that you can just change

301
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
somebody's password but they can't get

302
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
into the system

303
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
and the control side of things is where

304
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
we're falling down when it comes to our

305
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,600
security and how we protect ourselves

306
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
so on the control side

307
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,360
of this triangle

308
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,519
you can see that what we have in here

309
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
we've got our traditional firewalls our

310
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,920
multi-factor authentication

311
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
but then let's introduce more tools to

312
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,519
that okay

313
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,279
application whitelisting

314
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,040
basically allow only the applications

315
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,800
that you want to run in your environment

316
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
to run

317
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,160
we've got ring phantom which controls

318
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
what they can and cannot do

319
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
and storage control to protect our our

320
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
actual data

321
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
all of this is about

322
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
what we call zero trust

323
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,519
and the idea of xero trust is given the

324
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
least amount of privileges

325
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
to our applications and our users within

326
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
their environments

327
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,000
and the reason why i say applications is

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
is that every application that you run

329
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
on your machine has exactly the same

330
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
access to all of your data that you have

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
as a user

332
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,839
very simple google chrome has all those

333
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,639
privileges that you have as a user to

334
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,240
access all of that confidential

335
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
information within your environment

336
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
so let's start minimizing the risk

337
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
and start

338
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,760
enhancing how we can protect ourselves

339
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,959
okay

340
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,720
so zero through security it blocks

341
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
everything by default

342
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,760
okay

343
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,399
once we're in a zero trust environment

344
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,800
we're only allowing the tools to run

345
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
that we wish to allow to run and we're

346
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,839
going to block and deny everything else

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,959
okay

348
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
so with treadlocker there's a number of

349
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
ways that we do this and we approach the

350
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
xero trust model

351
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
so firstly

352
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,680
application waitlist

353
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
allow only the applications that you

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,760
want to run within your environment and

355
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,279
deny any executable of any process

356
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,440
that you do not pre-approve beforehand

357
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
why is this so important

358
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
zero-day attacks

359
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,639
using processes that we haven't

360
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,160
pre-approved

361
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
because we haven't pre-approved them

362
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
we've stopped them from executing in our

363
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
environment

364
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,760
any vulnerabilities that they're going

365
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,519
to execute by by taking any ver or foils

366
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,720
we're going to stop and deny that

367
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
ring fencer

368
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,399
of you allowed applications going on

369
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
allowing our environment we're going to

370
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
put controls around them

371
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,720
do we want microsoft office to be able

372
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,959
to access powershell

373
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,399
no we don't

374
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
because that is actually one of the most

375
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,959
common ways ransomware is brought into

376
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
our environment

377
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
it's microsoft office links clicking on

378
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
powershell to download a payload so

379
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
we're going to stop powershell from the

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,560
under and office from accessing that

381
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,800
again powershell powershell has the

382
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,199
ability to exfiltrate all of our data

383
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,720
what are we going to do

384
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,079
we're going to stop powershell from

385
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,680
accessing our data

386
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,120
we're going to control what it can

387
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
access

388
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
very simply stopping it from

389
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,839
exfiltrating that data

390
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,600
okay storage control

391
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,519
storage control is basically putting

392
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
policies around your data what can

393
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
access that data what applications can

394
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,959
access which data in your environment

395
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
as i said earlier

396
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
all applications have the same access to

397
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
all of the data that you have as a user

398
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
does it need high access no it doesn't

399
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,399
okay think about it if your environment

400
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,639
is infiltrated

401
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,160
what an infiltrator will do is they're

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
going to look for all the good items

403
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,360
where's all the good information where

404
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
are your backups let's find the backups

405
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
and destroy the backups why destroy your

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,519
backups you're more likely to pay out

407
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,680
for ransomware so let's put controls

408
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,079
around our backup so for our backup

409
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
location the only thing can access it is

410
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
our actual backup software that's it the

411
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,639
only thing so even if somebody does

412
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,240
infiltrate in your environment you're

413
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
not going to be able to access or damage

414
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,279
that that

415
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,959
precious data of your backups

416
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
elevation control

417
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
remove the user's need for local

418
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
administrative access

419
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
call out those privileges you don't need

420
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,160
them

421
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
okay we can elevate applications giving

422
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
users that privilege if they need but we

423
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,279
can do it in a controlled fashion

424
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,079
okay

425
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
finally i'd just like to show you this

426
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,720
and this is how ransomware has evolved

427
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
okay

428
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,079
gunner today is the you know spotty

429
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,959
teenager in a bedroom writing code

430
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
infecting your machine

431
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
this is actually a saporcha genuine

432
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
supporter from somebody who was infected

433
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
by ransomware

434
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,160
they were kind enough to actually tell

435
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
them how they can get around and how

436
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,399
they can avoid it in the future

437
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,079
very nice and very speedy response

438
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,399
it's a full business now it's no longer

439
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,399
an individual

440
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,160
okay so we need to start protecting

441
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,399
ourselves and start changing the way

442
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,160
we look at endpoint security

443
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,250
