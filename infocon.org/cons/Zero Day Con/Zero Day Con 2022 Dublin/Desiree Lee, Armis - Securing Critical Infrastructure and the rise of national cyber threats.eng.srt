1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
so welcome i'm here today to talk about

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
securing critical infrastructure

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
a couple of things uh first of all what

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,920
is it

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,599
second of all what is the threat that's

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,199
facing us there

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
i'm going to go through a case study

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,760
and then talk about where do we start

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,119
which i think is the important thing for

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,720
all of us in this room we're not

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,560
listening to the talk for fun i assume

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,599
that you have something that you're

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,080
interested in securing

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,800
so what is it

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,559
critical infrastructure if you are in

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
any of these categories you are critical

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
infrastructure

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
it means that you have a system that is

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
required for daily living it gets people

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
from point a to point b maybe it's

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,160
responsible for keeping them healthy for

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
hygiene for protecting them

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,879
for any of these reasons you are

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
actually playing a critical role in

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,959
national security

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
and the threat facing critical

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,120
infrastructure is different from the

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,438
threat facing maybe retail

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,159
or just a standard i.t shop a

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,680
legal office

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
it's different because i think for

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,520
anyone else this is the scariest thing

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
to see

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
nobody wants to see this this is an i.t

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,040
nightmare this is a ransomware notice

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,200
all your files have been encrypted

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,799
this is of course an issue for critical

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,520
infrastructure it's not the worst thing

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
facing critical infrastructure

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,880
i think this is where most people's

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
nightmares stop

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
if you have a system that is in any of

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
the categories of the previous

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
categories though

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,159
this is an issue for you but it gets

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,159
worse

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
so i want to talk about

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
an israeli water treatment facility this

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,479
attack happened in 2020

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,240
this treatment facility

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,799
i assume the israelis are pretty good at

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,079
security

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,320
and even they missed something really

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
important here

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,799
they had an hmi they had a human machine

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
interface system which means that this

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
is a computer a human operates the

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
computer on the back end though it's

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
talking to physical infrastructure

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
they had an hmi that was exposed to the

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
internet

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
so you could have seen this had you

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
looked on shodan which i i hope you all

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
know what showdown is i think it's a

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,000
critical part of any security org you

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
should be checking shodan it should be

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
telling you if there are internet

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,599
exposed assets that shouldn't be

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,360
a mail server or a web server you would

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,440
expect that's supposed to be hit by

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
somebody from the internet that's its

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,959
purpose

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
if it's anything else it should not be

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
exposed to the internet and yet they are

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
all the time

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
so that should be a regular check for

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
your organization do i have anything

78
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
that's that's internet facing that

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
shouldn't be we find it all the time

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
in this case it was a bad one so it's an

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,959
hmi this hmi is communicating to

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,040
programmable logic controllers

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,519
communicating to plcs

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
these plcs were responsible for

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,480
controlling the temperature of the water

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
for controlling the amount of chlorine

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
in the water

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,879
so you can imagine if this water is is

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
being delivered to a population they're

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
drinking it it has the the risk of

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,080
poisoning them so sure ransomware is bad

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,239
if you have critical infrastructure

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,680
there are other things to worry about

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,959
too

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,959
second thing that they failed at here

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,040
was that that hmi system didn't require

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
any authentication

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
and this is more common also than you

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
would like to think

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
they don't change the credentials in the

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,840
system nobody checks it for 20 years and

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
if you have a critical infrastructure

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,000
system especially for things like water

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
treatment or in energy a lot of those

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,120
devices have been online for decades in

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
some cases

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
and who's checking them who's checking

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
things like this

109
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
a lot of the times these kinds of

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,360
devices these non-standard devices

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
they're not going through the same

112
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
vulnerability gap assessment that the

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,760
standard managed compute is

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,599
and part of that and i'll get to this

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
more in a bit but part of that is people

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
don't know what to do with them you have

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
uh you have the the people in the plan

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
to understand these devices and then you

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
have the i.t people they're not the same

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
people

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
third thing that was an issue here

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
legacy system again really common in

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
critical infrastructure

124
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000
it's critical infrastructure so they're

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
not going through upgrade cycles like

126
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
you would in a standard patching process

127
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,000
for an i.t system that's doing billing

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
right

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
i mean that's fine take it down for a

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
weekend patch it great

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
for things like this though they tend to

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
fall they tend to fall out of that cycle

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,759
and the downtime is a risk in itself so

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
because of resistance to downtime

135
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,479
because of

136
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
risk to plant operations they don't end

137
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
up on the same upgrade cycle they're

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,360
often very old

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
and i'll talk about this final point

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
more in a bit

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,360
but attackers in this case

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,199
understood plc's

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
they got into the system they were able

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
to issue commands to the plc to read to

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
write to make it do something

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
they understood what they were doing

147
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
with those devices does your sock team

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
does your security team know what to do

149
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
if they see uh even if they could see it

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
right let's let's say that they can see

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
the communication back and forth to a

152
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
plc do they have any idea what's

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
expected

154
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
my guess is probably not

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,080
so where do you start

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
an anecdote my first job in college my

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
engineering internship was for a nuclear

158
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,080
power plant this nuclear power plant

159
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,919
and what they did was they hired six

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
interns to just go through blueprint

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,360
after blueprint of devices in the plant

162
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
and check and see if they were in the

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
computer system

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,400
if they weren't we had to go talk to the

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
plant engineer and add them to the

166
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
systems that they could get maintenance

167
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
be upgraded get on some kind of a

168
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
schedule

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
it took me 10 years to realize i was a

170
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
human asset discovery agent

171
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
and i was updating a cmdb

172
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
but what they were doing was smart so

173
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
they weren't just looking at devices on

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
the network right they were looking at

175
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
every device that was critical to plant

176
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
operations

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
so i'm guessing most of you have a cmdb

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
that's filled with

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
computers right it's got your endpoints

180
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,639
in it it's got your servers in it for

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
sure and it's probably not exactly up to

182
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,919
date or accurate but it's it's got most

183
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,759
of what's uh present in the network

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,880
there

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
what i'm guessing you don't have

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,600
is any record of where the hmis are

187
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,840
where your scada systems are which plcs

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,039
are online

189
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,400
i'm guessing that your building

190
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,039
management facili systems are handled by

191
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
facilities people and they're not

192
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,199
considered part of the network itself

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
we all remember the unlucky retailer

194
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
that got breached through their hvac

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,479
system

196
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,840
i mean the attackers are looking at

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
these devices we need to be looking at

198
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,479
these devices too

199
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
other things that are online

200
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
when i see client networks there are

201
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
industrial robotic arms they have ip

202
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
addresses they're communicating

203
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,639
what are they talking to do we have any

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,280
idea

205
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
monitoring system safety monitoring

206
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
systems there was a saudi arabian

207
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
petrochemical plant

208
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,639
that got attacked and they attacked

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,000
specifically

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
the monitoring systems that they could

211
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,560
tell

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
well so they would no longer be able to

213
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
tell if the values that they were

214
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,479
showing

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
indicating the health of the plant were

216
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
accurate or not

217
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
those are a big target

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,880
as our ip cameras i think there was a

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
maybe some of you are aware of the hick

220
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,919
vision cameras

221
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,759
the u.s department of defense issued a

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
notice about them they said that they

223
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
were compromised devices

224
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
if you look at the traffic from those ip

225
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
cameras they're not just communicating

226
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,919
for updates they're doing other things

227
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,599
so do you know where the ip cameras are

228
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,520
if an issue like that is

229
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
is uh if a notice like that is issued do

230
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,919
you know where they are to replace them

231
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
i think even responding to notices like

232
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
this is difficult we have no idea where

233
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
these devices reside

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,319
and there are some other obvious ones

235
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
here right i mean if you are if you have

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
a plant and that plant is using

237
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,000
chemicals in any way there are hardware

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
controllers those hardware controllers

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
are online

240
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,919
those are vulnerable

241
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,039
this is a really good example of a

242
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,200
vulnerability for a non-standard device

243
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
and these devices plcs programmable

244
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,599
logic controllers

245
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,120
they are in

246
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
every system that considers itself

247
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
critical infrastructure you've got plc's

248
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
on the network

249
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
these plcs are vulnerable and it's worse

250
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,959
than vulnerable

251
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,360
i doubt most security teams know how to

252
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
update them if there's a patch released

253
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,360
does your team know what to do if

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
they're supposed to update a plc

255
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
i think most don't that's not a failure

256
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
it's just a reality of security most

257
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
teams don't know what to do with that

258
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
information

259
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
but this one in particular

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
was a bad one and they're similar by the

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
way i'm not picking on schneider there

262
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
are similar cves for other vendors as

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
well

264
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
but this one in particular was

265
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
discovered by my company so of course

266
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,480
i'm going to talk about this one

267
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,279
and in fact it's it so it allows a

268
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
remote takeover

269
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
the person who takes over the plc can

270
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,600
even set it on fire

271
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,120
and the engineering wishes i was in the

272
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
lab when they figured that out i'm sure

273
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,399
we i'm sure we literally burned through

274
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
a few plc's uh in this research

275
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
but this can happen in your plant those

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
plcs are not just in manufacturing lines

277
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,399
those plcs are controlling security

278
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,160
doors as an example

279
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
and they're

280
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
they're all over the place they're all

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,839
over your network do you know where they

282
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,839
are

283
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
so the problem doesn't stop when you

284
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
have the inventory

285
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
and i i think discovery and inventory of

286
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
what's on your network is critical

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
but it doesn't stop there that's just

288
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
the technology piece

289
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
then there's there's a process and a

290
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,000
people piece of this as well

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
so

292
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
most companies

293
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
let's not even get into special devices

294
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
or non-standard devices

295
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,079
most companies can't respond to the

296
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
vulnerabilities that they know about

297
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
right now

298
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,000
in fact i talked to a major enterprise

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
and

300
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,200
i'll tell you there i'll tell you their

301
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,399
method for

302
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,160
dealing with cves

303
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,920
they have a ranking system it's not just

304
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
the cvss score it's slightly more

305
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
interesting than that

306
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,079
but they have a ranking system and they

307
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
put them in a list and they take the top

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
25 and they draw a line under the 25th

309
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
one and nothing below that is ever

310
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
remediated

311
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
and and this is not this is not uncommon

312
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
like this is the process that most

313
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,160
companies are facing so

314
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
we are in a state where we can't even

315
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,839
manage the vulnerabilities for

316
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,600
for regular devices for the things that

317
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,320
we're currently monitoring and aware of

318
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
there is a really poor

319
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
understanding or

320
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,079
ability

321
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,800
to prioritize you have a limited team

322
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,079
you don't have an unlimited security

323
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,079
budget you're not going to be able to

324
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,519
monitor or fix everything you just can't

325
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
so there's got to be a better way to

326
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
prioritize than drawing a line under the

327
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,240
25th i mean i don't even blame them for

328
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
doing this i think they don't have the

329
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
tools to they don't have the tools to do

330
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,720
it differently

331
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,399
but i would offer that the device

332
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,079
context knowing what's on your network

333
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,079
having device context

334
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,120
it gives you a way to prioritize

335
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,079
better

336
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,800
so i care if there's an endpoint that is

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
infected with malware i care much more

338
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,560
if it's my domain controller that's

339
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
infected with malware

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
so understanding the the what the device

341
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
is and what its purpose is is critical

342
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
any devices that control physical

343
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
hardware should be prioritized hmis data

344
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,959
systems plc's

345
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,480
you have to pay attention to them they

346
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
need to be monitored you need to

347
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,519
understand the traffic and that's the

348
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
key piece you have to understand what's

349
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,720
expected

350
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
of these devices

351
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,000
and critically anything that's old and

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,399
again critical infrastructure has a big

353
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,399
problem with this there is legacy

354
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,760
everywhere

355
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,839
anything that's old anything that's not

356
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,560
covered by existing tooling the hmi

357
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
probably doesn't have an endpoint agent

358
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
it just doesn't

359
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
so what's the plan for devices that

360
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
don't have any protection

361
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
and i'll say

362
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
in addition to prioritizing by device

363
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
prioritized by

364
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,639
the egregious gaps

365
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
i see these all the time in networks

366
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
surely we can get really fancy with

367
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
security and think about nation state

368
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,399
threats and what are we going to do for

369
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,720
some complex attack

370
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
i don't even think that worrying about

371
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
the complex attack is important if you

372
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,720
don't have table stake security and

373
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
often there isn't table stake security

374
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
and i'll give you a few examples from

375
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
things i've actually seen

376
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
you would be shocked by the number of

377
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
environments that have

378
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
uh dark web traffic or actual tor nodes

379
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
in them

380
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
security has no idea

381
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,760
uh devices that are establishing

382
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
connections to external devices with

383
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
control protocols i mean this is a this

384
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,279
is

385
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,240
this is

386
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
foundational security nothing like that

387
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
should be happening in your network

388
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
these devices are communicating with

389
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
command and control sites at times

390
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,079
systems again i'll talk about showdown

391
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,760
should be checking showdown systems that

392
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,279
are exposed to the internet that

393
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,320
shouldn't be

394
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,199
are

395
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,079
are

396
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,360
top of the list

397
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,199
figure out what's exposed should it be

398
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
exposed if it's not remediate it right

399
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
away

400
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
so it's not just about the cve it's not

401
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,760
just about looking at a list of

402
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,680
vulnerabilities it's about understanding

403
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,639
the

404
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
understanding where in your network you

405
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
have problems with things that are uh

406
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
you know the abcs of keeping an

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,199
environment secure

408
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,399
but that's a that's a process problem

409
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
tech problem we talked about those

410
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
there's also a people problem

411
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
i don't think most organizations let's

412
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
say that they solved the tech they have

413
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
visibility into everything i don't think

414
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
most organizations know what to do with

415
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
it

416
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
if you if your stock analyst gets an

417
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
alert for

418
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,199
uh it'll go back to plc's gets an alert

419
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
for a plc let's say that the israeli

420
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,199
water treatment facility had a sock team

421
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
that would get full visibility into the

422
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,279
commands sent to plcs

423
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,920
do they have any idea what to do with it

424
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,360
typically those

425
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
that information is in silos you've got

426
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
the it people you have the ot people or

427
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
you have the medical people or you have

428
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
the people that specialize in the

429
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
systems themselves and then you have

430
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,519
very i.t focused uh managed device

431
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,760
focused people that are that are

432
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
making up the sock and that's not true

433
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
and some in some companies have gotten a

434
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
handle on this

435
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,040
some companies have a very integrated

436
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
security team that is not the norm

437
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
so i think as an organization it's

438
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
important to ask

439
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,079
what what will you do from a people

440
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,680
perspective here what kind of training

441
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
are you going to give your sock team how

442
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,920
will your sock team know again let's say

443
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
they've got the technology we worked

444
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
that out how will they know who to call

445
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
when they get an alert for a device

446
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,839
that's a

447
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
critical system but it's at a site on

448
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
the other side of the world

449
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
they don't have any remote remediation

450
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
capabilities

451
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,839
who do they call do they do they

452
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,680
understand who owns it there's an

453
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,199
ownership problem in critical

454
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,880
infrastructure

455
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
we are we are fighting the mindset that

456
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,360
we've been in for decades where again

457
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
you've got people that manage the system

458
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
that own the system and your people that

459
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
own security and they're separate so as

460
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
we think about converging there's all

461
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
this talk about convergence in the

462
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
network right converging the medical and

463
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,680
i.t

464
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,639
converging ot or ics and i.t

465
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
that convergence also needs to happen in

466
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
people it needs to happen in training it

467
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
needs to happen in the mindset of the

468
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
organization

469
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
not just in technology

470
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
and so the final point i want to make is

471
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
that when clients get breached

472
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
most of the time

473
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,279
they're operating in silos

474
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
they're ashamed of it they don't want to

475
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
publicize it it's brand it's a brand hit

476
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
it's a reputational problem

477
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,240
and maybe it's not something that they

478
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,839
have to report

479
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
so they don't say anything so instead

480
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,079
what i see are security teams operating

481
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,320
in complete silos from one another that

482
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
is not how attackers behave

483
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
attackers are not siloed attackers learn

484
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,440
from each other and they get better

485
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
so i think as an industry my my final

486
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
point here especially when it comes to a

487
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,000
relatively new space of security for

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
critical infrastructure

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
is that we need to be talking to each

490
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,560
other more

491
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
we have to learn from each other

492
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
if we're not talking about these things

493
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
if we're not sharing information if

494
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,199
we're not getting better against

495
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,519
attackers by learning from the stakes

496
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,519
and successes of others

497
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
then we've already lost

498
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
so talk to your peers

499
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,000
i would urge you

500
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,359
learn from your peers start talking

501
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
about what they're doing with their

502
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
people what they're doing to to learn

503
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
about these devices uh what they're

504
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
doing from a tooling perspective to get

505
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,240
insight into the areas where they lack

506
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,520
