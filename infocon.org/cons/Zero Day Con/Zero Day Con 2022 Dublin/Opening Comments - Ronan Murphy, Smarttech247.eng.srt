1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
can i firstly say that um it's

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
tremendous privilege for for me and for

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,000
my team to welcome everyone here today

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,920
it was a pretty tough decision for us to

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,600
decide would this go ahead because

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
obviously the logistics take take a

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
number of months to get in place and i

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,920
think we decided to make the decision we

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,599
we we we would drive ahead with the

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,359
event after cancelling it two years in a

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,400
row uh back in in december so an amazing

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,120
amazing achievement by the team um

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
we have a tremendous lineup of speakers

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,520
uh today and panelists and subject

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
matter experts

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
who a lot of whom have flown in from

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
around the globe and they're going to

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,640
share with you their own unique

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,559
insights and perspectives on many

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,280
interesting topics cyber security

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
cyber crime

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,879
cyber warfare obviously which is very

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,960
prevalent in the day the day we now live

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,760
in

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
artificial intelligence machine learning

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,760
data regulation and much much more so

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,359
it's going to be a fascinating day for

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
for listening to the dialogue but also

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
from a networking perspective and many

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
of the participants like you are

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
responsible for protecting their own

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
organizations protecting their networks

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,479
their clouds their applications their

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
infrastructure their people their data

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,000
their intellectual property

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,799
um

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,200
but before i introduce the first set of

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,479
speakers

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,280
i get 10 minutes so i've got to be quick

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
to maybe reflect on some of the macro

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
teams that have affected the industry

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
and the world from a cyber security

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
perspective over the last two years now

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
normally i only have to consolidate 12

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,560
months into the opening gambit of zero

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
decant this time i have to do two years

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
but what a two years it's been when you

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,479
look at the scale of the problem from a

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,560
cyber perspective it really is

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,880
unprecedented um obviously

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
it starts with the the covert 19

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,920
pandemic and this was a remarkable it

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
was an unprecedented event and it

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,759
altered the lives

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
of billions of people around the globe

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
and it resulted in what's commonly now

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,959
referred to as the new normal the the

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
societal norms that we're all used in

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
how we work and how we live and how we

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,200
engage and we need to interact wind out

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,680
the window everything changed

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
but aside from how it affected our lives

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
it and our businesses it had an

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,400
incredibly profound

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
impact on cyber security and cyber crime

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
you could argue that the cronovirus

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
pandemic

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,239
created the perfect petri dish that

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,800
allowed cybercrime to flourish at an

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,920
unprecedented rate

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,080
see you gotta understand and i think you

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,160
all do understand that when people are

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
in a heightened state of anxiety they're

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
much more susceptible to click on the

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
link or they're much more susceptible to

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
go down the rabbit hole of

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
misinformation

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
um

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
and the bad guys latched on to this

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
brilliantly absolutely brilliantly i

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
would say far better than the cyber

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,319
security industry did and they

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,519
capitalized and that was born out both

84
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,080
at a consumer level but also at a at a

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
governmental level and also at a

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
corporate enterprise level and there's

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
not a man or woman in this building who

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
didn't have a brush with that

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
you got the text message from amazon

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
from fedex from dhl your package was

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
missing you had to pay attacks on brexit

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
you got to miss call from azerbaijan or

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
albania it was phishing it was business

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,000
email compromise it was invoice fraud

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
redirection it was extortion it was

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
extortion it was money mulling it was

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,640
money laundering it was um

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
it was it was the most cd underbelly of

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,040
the internet we had ever seen and it was

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
relentless

101
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
on one hand we were taking calls from

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
consumers who'd lost everything and this

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
stuff really wasn't getting headline

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
news and on the other hand we're getting

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
calls from hospitals with all of their

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
deleted delayed

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,040
the data deleted which was which was

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
pretty profound but

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,000
there was a high degree of

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
sophistication to this as well

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
early in the pandemic we saw the first

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,879
wave

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,439
of supply chain attacks and i know

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
that the csos in this room and the

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
people responsible for hardening the

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
defenses of large organizations shudder

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
when they think about this

118
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
the solarwinds hack

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,280
was the largest cyber security problem

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
of the 21st century

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,919
and

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
how we found out about it was as

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
surprising as it was alarming

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
because one of the best companies in

125
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
cyber security fireeye announced they

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
had been breached

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
and when they retrospectively

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
forensically analyzed what happened they

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,160
found that a russian espionage

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,840
organization had successfully

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
infiltrated their defenses in a very

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
sophisticated manner they bypassed all

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
of their security all of their

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
monitoring and they got to the core of

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,479
their network

136
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
and they had done it under the guise of

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
the solarwinds technology because they

138
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,199
had hacked the source code

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,479
this was a huge problem and it was a

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,880
massive wake-up call to the industry

141
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,320
globally every company in this room uses

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
open source technology every company in

143
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
this room uses third-party suppliers to

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,320
power their business to drive

145
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
operational efficiencies and now all of

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
a sudden these become the risk

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
and downstream from solar winds 18 000

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,639
customers around the world were hacked

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,880
so you've got an enemy state who now

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
have access to the most

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
crucial information in government

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
agencies throughout the globe the scale

153
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
was unbelievable but and you'll hear

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
hear ibm speak about this later

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
other supply chain attacks were not so

156
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,120
much about espionage they were about

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
commercialization

158
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
and cassay was an interesting one

159
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
what this demonstrated was lacks

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
approach to harding of your systems the

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
patching of vulnerabilities

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
has dire consequences

163
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
and funnily i was engaged by the us

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
government to help with the cassaya

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
attack

166
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
and we looked at the scale of it we said

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
it's too big for us we can't help just

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
too many people affected and the fallout

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
is is incredible the the attack was

170
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
conducted by rival the notorious

171
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,199
ransomware gang and they published on

172
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,560
their blogger thing to call it happy

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
blog that he had infected one million

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
devices and this was simply because

175
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,639
cassaya had not patched the

176
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,199
vulnerability and to get the bad guys

177
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
struck before they did

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
overnight

179
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,479
it felt like to us the game had changed

180
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,800
you'll hear a lot about ransomware today

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
but ransomware was no longer the problem

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
the problem was now the data

183
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
we are now entering into a realm of what

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
we call double extortion where the bad

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,440
guys know when they they realize that

186
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
you know companies are getting better at

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
disaster recovery business continuity

188
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
data backup

189
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
so they have to get the data and then

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,280
once they got the data they could

191
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
blackmail them which worked incredibly

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
successfully and we saw companies

193
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
overnight paying because they knew the

194
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,280
data was being weaponized and the the

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
lines were being blurred between between

196
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,479
ransomware and data breaches you the

197
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,960
collision of two worlds all of a sudden

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
and when you talk about uh double

199
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,120
extortion it to in our mind it was

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
triple extortion because while these

201
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
guys were negotiating with us on one

202
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,199
hand to sell them give them bitcoin for

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,680
decryption keys they were threatening on

204
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
the other hand to decipher and

205
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
disseminate the data but on the other

206
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,360
hand they were also blackmailing

207
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,880
individuals whose data that they had

208
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,400
stolen it was an incredibly um

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
stressful situation for organizations

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
who found themselves in this predicament

211
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
and therefore they paid so overnight the

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
bad guys made billions and i mean

213
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
billions and people don't realize the

214
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,360
scale of what they make

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,879
and a great example would have been the

216
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
colonial pipeline in north america

217
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,479
critical infrastructure they paid within

218
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,080
a couple of hours now they managed to

219
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
recoup that money some great work by by

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
the us government but they still paid

221
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
and many other companies that flew under

222
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
the radar paid uh this was a national

223
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
emergency in several states in the u.s

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
where you saw people queuing up because

225
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
they couldn't access

226
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,000
gas to fill their cars

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
and obviously we got a front row seat

228
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
here in ireland we were in the main show

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,680
in the midst of a pandemic our entire

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,840
health service was successfully hacked

231
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,720
no when they hacked the hsc

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,879
they very very successfully got access

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
to the network through a phishing email

234
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,440
they they they navigated their way

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
around the network they figured out

236
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839
where all of the voluntary and the

237
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,279
statue statutory hospitals were they did

238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,800
traverse their way across the network

239
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
got in found the data stole it encrypted

240
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,760
and created uh pandemonium that was the

241
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
country kanti ransomware gang who

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
subsequently were hacked two weeks ago

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,519
and now it now transpires that they were

244
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,560
actually run by the russian government

245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
who gave us the keys to the crypt so

246
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,040
that's a whole interesting different

247
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
discussion that we can have some other

248
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
time but it just shows the scale of this

249
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,600
problem

250
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
and very importantly what

251
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
we now understand about cyber security

252
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
and i think most of you here will

253
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
understand it as well

254
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
is that you're not fighting one

255
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
adversary you're not fighting one nation

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
state you are fighting an entire

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,360
ecosystem and at every stage of that

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
ecosystem from the beginning to the end

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
you're fighting the best of the best

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
you're fighting the best

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
penetration testers you're fighting the

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,880
guys who are best at building botnets

263
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,560
you're fighting the guys who are best at

264
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
fishing campaigns you're fighting the

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
guys who are the best at navigating a

266
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,839
network to circumvent your security

267
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
tools and turn off monitoring devices

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
you're fighting the most scrupulous

269
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,320
criminals and these guys interact in a

270
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,839
marketplace where they build affiliate

271
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
programs they do revenue share and

272
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
when you have a guy who and he gets a

273
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
foothold within a media organization or

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
utility company or an oil and gas

275
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
company he goes up the value chain in

276
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,440
terms of selling his access and these

277
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
guys split it out so the scale of the

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
problem is incredibly profound because

279
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,959
you're fighting the best at every stage

280
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,800
i would argue that the ransomware guys

281
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
who come in at the end and kind of get

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
the glory and the notoriety

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,800
are really just the scrupulous criminals

284
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
they've just leaned and and taken the

285
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,519
value out of the ecosystem who are the

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
more technical guys down the stream who

287
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
don't actually want to end up in in in

288
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
prison in in the us or wherever so the

289
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,519
the ecosystem in the marketplace that is

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,079
enabling this to happen is now well

291
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,160
funded they're very rich and they're

292
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
extremely dangerous so it it is worrying

293
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
times and then again for my seesaw

294
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
friends in the audience here you pile on

295
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
massive vulnerabilities where you don't

296
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
even know where they are across a

297
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,959
massive global infrastructure that can

298
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
allow people to exploit and get access

299
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,160
you compound the problem and uh log 4j

300
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
is a perfect example of that and i know

301
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,360
there's still many people in the room

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
scrambling to understand where where

303
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,040
those vulnerabilities are i'm nearly out

304
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,760
of time so i got to hurry up but i i

305
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
want to finish up and i want to talk

306
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,079
about uh the conflict in in ukraine and

307
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,200
um

308
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
i have a lot of staff who who are from

309
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,519
ukraine and also from russia and it's a

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,760
it's an absolutely terrible situation

311
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
and

312
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
i think i think putin's war probably is

313
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
the most acute

314
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
cyber risk

315
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
that western governments and businesses

316
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
have ever faced

317
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
the invasion

318
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,959
is leading to incredibly punitive and

319
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
severe sanctions on the russian people

320
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
and the general consensus is that as

321
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
russia becomes more of a prior state as

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
a result of these sanctions

323
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,560
that they will respond asymmetrically

324
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
with a very significant

325
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
cyber capability

326
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
so what does the cyber war look like

327
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,279
there's precedent fardis

328
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
in 2017 the nsa and the us were hacked

329
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
and they had built up an arsenal of

330
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
zero-day vulnerabilities to use against

331
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
their adversaries um

332
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
shadow brokers were were the group that

333
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
hacked them and they dumped these

334
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
vulnerabilities on the dark web for

335
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,200
anybody to use the first to mobilize was

336
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,639
kim jong-un or created build one

337
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
accredited targeted the uk and spain and

338
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
that spread out to be a massive massive

339
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
uh problem globally but a few weeks

340
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
later uh russia did the same they

341
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,480
mobilized they did they took the zero to

342
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,560
vulnerability

343
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,360
ms-17101 i think and they effectively

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
uh weaponized it to attack ukraine

345
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
the problem is this wiper malware spread

346
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,920
out of control it spilled over the

347
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
borders and it

348
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
due to the interconnectivity that of the

349
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
world we now live in it affected

350
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
organizations globally at an incredibly

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,959
profound rate it it infected 150

352
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,720
countries that infected

353
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
hundreds of thousands of assets and

354
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,440
massive organizations like msd and the

355
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,079
danish shipping giant maersk

356
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,480
and it became a huge huge problem

357
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
what we learned from that is that

358
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
while governments can protect nuclear

359
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,240
bombs and weapons of mass destruction

360
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
they're not very good at protecting

361
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
destructive digital assets like zero-day

362
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
vulnerabilities

363
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
and we also learned

364
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
that this represents a massive

365
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,000
capability in the escalation of cyber

366
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
attacks

367
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,399
and that the ability to contain this is

368
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
a real problem

369
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,040
now while in this conflict

370
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,079
there's no

371
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,000
massive zero-day vulnerability like the

372
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,519
microsoft vulnerability from not

373
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
patching and wannacry there is warmable

374
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
wiper malwares being developed

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,480
to target the ukraine and the problem is

376
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
it's only a matter of time before they

377
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,279
spill over the borders and before we see

378
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,320
the fallout from this not to mention

379
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
the the asymmetric attacks that we are

380
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
going to face coming down the line so it

381
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,240
is a very

382
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,639
it is a very uncertain time it's a very

383
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,240
nervous time for anybody in cyber

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,880
security and i think you could now argue

385
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,320
and i think some of our panelists might

386
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
talk about it today that we are now

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,120
truly entering the gray war

388
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,320
the cyber war and in that cyber war the

389
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
benefits are

390
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,920
it is very difficult to assign

391
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,199
attribution

392
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,800
it's very difficult to define who

393
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,399
exactly did it

394
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
while intelligence agencies will have a

395
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
good indication of who has done it is

396
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,680
still difficult to effectively nail it

397
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,680
down

398
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,199
you
