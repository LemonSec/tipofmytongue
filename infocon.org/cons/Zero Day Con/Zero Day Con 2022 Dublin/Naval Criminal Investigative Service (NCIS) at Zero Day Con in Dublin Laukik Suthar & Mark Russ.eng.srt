1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
good morning everybody um we're going to

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
go through a little bit of a

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
law enforcement working with industry

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,599
type

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
startup we'll talk a little bit about

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,920
the ncis mission and as we go through

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,199
this we're going to talk a little bit

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,199
about agility

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
as it hand works hand in hand with the

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,400
innovation

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
we're going to talk about integration a

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,119
lot

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,679
because the whole reason why any of us

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,238
have jobs is to make sure that we're

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
sharing the information that we

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,480
have within our organizations but at the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,440
same time protecting those organizations

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
from bad guys and i'll just use that

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
term i won't mention any countries or

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
any entities and then last but not least

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
we have to worry about the impact what

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
it means at the end of the day

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,360
and for ncis our mission is relatively i

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
guess i need to use the clicker here our

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,440
mission is pretty simple

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,399
we protect the navy and the marine corps

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
many of you have probably seen the tv

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,239
show which they do in about an hour and

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
it's really really simple

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
not so not so much

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,799
we protect the navy and the marine corps

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,080
and contractors and academia

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,960
and industry from bad guys

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,920
in

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
fighting wars and maintaining that

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,479
strategic advantage associated with the

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,479
navy marine corps mission

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
so i just said that

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
so prevent protect reduce

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,840
prevent secrets

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,799
uh

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
and terrorism protect secrets and reduce

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
crime so that i said that too so sorry

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
all right so let me talk a little bit

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
about how we do

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
the previous things and then we'll keep

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
we'll get into

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,799
his three c's which

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,840
are the underpinning of how we work

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,360
you know for years and years and years

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,799
all of our countries have been in

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,719
competition with each other to maintain

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,479
that strategic advantage

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,038
and in many instances maintaining that

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,200
strategic advantage kind of gets lost in

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,480
the sauce

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
as you're

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
signing up signing up a new contract

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,400
or developing a new technology or making

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
sure that that technology is delivered

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
uncompromised to ultimately

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
one of our governments or one of our

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
organizations and if a compromise occurs

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
at any place

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
in those early stages

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
what happens

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
it's potentially unreliable

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,319
the security that's associated with it

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,959
may have some limitations

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,040
and last but not least

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
you're not giving that

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,440
bill payer what they paid for ultimately

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
when it comes to that piece of gear

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
and unfortunately

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
the checks and balances we're talking

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
nearly a million people for the navy and

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,519
the marine corps alone

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,280
but if you wrap into

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
that construct

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
all of our organizations

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
private sector public sector

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
industry when it comes to academia

83
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,080
industry when it comes to research and

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
development technology you've got

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,879
millions and millions and millions of

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,360
people working those issues

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
and with those millions of people come

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
all the vulnerabilities and the risks

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
associated with them

90
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
so we have to make sure that we're

91
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
connecting and we're integrating

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
some of the good news stories that

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
you've heard earlier

94
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,879
and the results of some of the bad news

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,440
stories that you heard earlier as well

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
and unfortunately

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
we don't have a lot of time on our hands

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,159
because the next crisis is already in

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,599
the works right now

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,360
you know we we talked a little bit about

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,200
ukraine earlier we talked a little bit

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
about the pandemic and the effects of it

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
but there is another crisis right around

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
the corner

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,599
and our workforces have to be ready for

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,040
that crisis

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,879
and for the most part

108
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,360
it could come from almost anywhere

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
and as was mentioned earlier it's

110
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,720
extremely profitable for the bad guys

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
to kind of work within our

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
environments

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,918
to

114
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,839
work against us

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,759
and in many instances people are

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
compromising things

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
unwittingly

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
and in rare occasions where lake and i

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
come into place from a law enforcement

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
standpoint where people are going to go

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,400
to jail

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
go to prison for a long time

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,280
people are doing it intentionally

124
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
or they're feigning ignorance in terms

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,080
of

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,639
some technological loophole

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,840
or some loophole in policy or procedure

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
or some loophole in terms of a company's

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,040
standards right and that's where

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
it's important for all of us

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
to understand the benefits of that

132
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
integration

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
sharing information sharing threat

134
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
information

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
sharing vulnerabilities

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,199
and

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
when it comes to an example we'll talk

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,360
about a little bit early later

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
a lot of it boils down to are you

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
willing to raise your hand and say that

141
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
you've been compromised

142
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
are you willing to share that

143
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
information with law enforcement or

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
counterintelligence organizations

145
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
regardless of the country

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,800
to make sure it doesn't happen again

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,320
and make sure that that particular

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
device or or military platform that's

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
supposed to be delivered uncompromised

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
works during

151
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,000
an act of uh conflict around the world

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
so i'll turn it over to lake

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
hi everybody uh kik suthar i'm a special

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
agent um with ncis but i'm also the cio

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
and it's kind of weird because i get to

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
do a little bit of a uh

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
giving back to the organization when it

158
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
comes technology but i just wanted to

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
share something with you real quick um

160
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
we're gonna i'm gonna get into the three

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
c's but i'm gonna

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
go fairly quickly on how an attack so

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
i'm an attacker i'm gonna go in i send

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
my uh spearfishing email it has some

165
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
type of a link to uh site link gets

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
downloaded gets about 500 people you

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
download the um the actual bash code

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
bash codes go on your computer it tries

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
to execute it the execution sometimes

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
occurs it doesn't depends on what your

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
site security is depends on where

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,120
location of the

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
environment is and then all of a sudden

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
it does work the person gets compromised

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
you get on the system you get access to

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
a little bit of something you try to

177
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
create another account because you want

178
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
to look like you're alive and a real

179
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
person so you create a real account and

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
then now you're trying to move lateral

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,479
so you move lateral and you get into

182
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,000
a more of a different type of system

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
you're going to administrative accounts

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
here so now you want to get again

185
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,240
elevating privilege get into

186
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,479
administrative accounts and now i am

187
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
going to look at

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,960
how do i get to the information so i'm

189
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,319
going to get to the database so i'm

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,759
going to get to the database because

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
that's where the data is that is

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,840
the gold

193
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
i elevate i get lateral i find another

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
account i compromised it cleaned up my

195
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
tracks and now we're at six months in

196
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,160
and nobody knows any better i get to the

197
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
data center and guess what it's

198
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
as good as i want it to be

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
i look at it

200
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,560
and i'm going to decide what i'm going

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,919
to do with it well first thing i'm

202
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,199
probably going to do is manipulate it

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
change it up well actually i'm going to

204
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,360
expel everything i can manipulate it and

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
then

206
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,840
encrypt it

207
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
light a match throw it on it

208
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
and catch it on fire

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
so

210
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
let's go toward the cyber security side

211
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
as the cio

212
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,280
i got the junior admin so what's going

213
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
to happen on the company side or the

214
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
organization side they're going to look

215
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
at it and they're going to be like oh

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
i see something over there what is that

217
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,039
it's a light

218
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,639
so the junior admin might say it's a

219
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
light and then you got a senior person

220
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
saying

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
no

222
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
that's a freaking

223
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,080
dumpster fire that's coming toward us

224
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
and everybody knows about dumpster fires

225
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
because we all have them if you're in

226
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
i.t

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
everybody has them don't raise your

228
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,440
hands i can see the smiles and um

229
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
so me as a cio i don't call it a

230
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,479
dumpster fire i don't call it fires i

231
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,879
just call it unplanned work

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,599
and that's where the ceo or the

233
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,879
organizational leader is going to come

234
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,000
in and they look at that and they'll be

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
like i have no idea what that is

236
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,879
most of you know that because they don't

237
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,080
know what it is

238
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
you can explain it to them you can take

239
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
out crayons you can take a construction

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,520
paper you can explain how this is going

241
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
to impact everybody but they still don't

242
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,199
see the dumpster and they don't know

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
what the fire means just yet so what i

244
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
did was i looked at the three c's

245
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
capability capacity and control

246
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
fairly quickly capability is what is

247
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
your people capable of doing and you

248
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
have to explain this in a very

249
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
high level

250
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,719
do you have the capable people in your

251
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
organization to do the job do you have

252
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
the capable equipment do you have the

253
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
capable software do you have that in

254
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
your you might good

255
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
talk about capacity

256
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
do you have all those people have enough

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
time to do everything that they need to

258
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,480
do you got the dumpster fire that's

259
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
coming towards you because you know the

260
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
company is about to get

261
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600
had the information get out everywhere

262
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,360
so what do you do

263
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
you have the capabilities they're

264
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,519
already patching they're already doing

265
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,399
vulnerabilities they're fixing

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
somebody's computer you've got a leader

267
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,519
over here who's mad his email doesn't

268
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
work you've got customers yelling so

269
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
do you have that now the next one is

270
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
control

271
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
control is a very interesting one

272
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
because it's again data

273
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
i'm gonna go into three again three

274
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
other

275
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
uh issues here three

276
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,680
which is

277
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
your data

278
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
and we talk about supply chain everybody

279
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
knows about supply chain everybody knows

280
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
where your information

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
kinda is

282
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
uh but you know how to make the widget

283
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
that's what your company does

284
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,959
and there's a supply chain for that you

285
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,560
get all these pieces there's a string

286
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,600
that comes about and it creates your

287
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
widget

288
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
that's the first supply chain the second

289
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
supply chain we already heard about it

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
is a cyber security side

291
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
you know where your stuff is coming from

292
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
have you vetted it have you looked into

293
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
it

294
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
so that's number two number three is the

295
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,839
new

296
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,360
one your data does not stay with you

297
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,399
anymore

298
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,399
your data is on the cloud whatever that

299
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,399
means

300
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,040
so if it's on the cloud

301
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
are you paying attention to where their

302
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
stuff is coming from where their routers

303
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,560
their systems

304
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
probably not

305
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
so that's something that i like to say

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
about

307
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
the supply chain it's very important

308
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
there's a fourth one that just came out

309
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
last about two years ago

310
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
it's from the pandemic

311
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,040
it's people who want to do things faster

312
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,160
and they want to do it from home so

313
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
where they can put that stuff

314
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,839
in their house

315
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,440
because it's easy

316
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,519
if you don't have a virtual desktop then

317
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,040
guess what you're going to give them a

318
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
computer go home and hopefully they

319
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,480
don't lose it oh and hopefully you're

320
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,600
encrypting it

321
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
i don't know but

322
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
and if they put it on their home

323
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
computer the information's gone so where

324
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,399
do you go where is where are these

325
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,680
people going towards they're going to go

326
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
to the

327
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,279
underbelly

328
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
so these two documents everybody knows

329
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,800
about the hsc and um really focusing on

330
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
something i read in hsc it's 157 pages

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
if you haven't read it

332
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
157 pages

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
and um

334
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
there was one comment in there they have

335
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,200
about

336
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,480
350 people

337
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
working on

338
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,120
i believe about 140 000 people 70 000

339
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,519
devices

340
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
that goes to a capacity and capability

341
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
thing they probably were very capable

342
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
but are they did they have capacity they

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,079
have control

344
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,959
good document this other one

345
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,839
is from the department of navy

346
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,160
it's interesting because this one was

347
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
presented to congress it was for the

348
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
secretary of navy to say that you have a

349
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,839
problem you have a culture problem when

350
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,560
it comes to all information

351
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
um very good one it talks about

352
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,839
resources because i helped write that

353
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
actually i wrote the resource section on

354
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,839
that one next slide

355
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,440
read these documents so i'm going to get

356
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,120
into i'm not going to get into the whole

357
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
uh on the on the

358
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
left side or your right side

359
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
what i've created i was the special

360
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,079
agent in charge for all cyber

361
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
investigations and operations within

362
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
ncis so i created something that was

363
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,279
very simple

364
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,440
because remember we talked about that

365
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
person in a suit the ceo has to be very

366
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
simple

367
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,160
it has to be simple so i called it eva

368
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,440
it's a term

369
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,959
knowing that

370
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,160
you're going to have the vulnerabilities

371
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
no matter what happens it's irrelevant

372
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,079
what is going on today because all of

373
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,480
this stuff has a commonality

374
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,440
you're always going to go back to eva

375
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
you're going to have a vulnerability

376
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,079
that comes out you're going to have an

377
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,360
exploit that comes out and then you're

378
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,079
going to have a path for the bad people

379
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,760
to come in and take it

380
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
and we see that

381
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,639
these are always

382
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
going to be there could be an insider

383
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
and that's what we focus on when it

384
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,240
comes to uh

385
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
criminal acts

386
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
so

387
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,160
i mentioned earlier

388
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,120
a good way for a problem a dumpster fire

389
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
to evolve in a bad way

390
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
so let's go with the bad way first

391
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
if if your information has been

392
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
compromised and it doesn't matter where

393
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,839
you are you could be at a university

394
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,160
that's developing the next generation

395
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,440
weapon

396
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
you could be

397
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,720
at a company that's making underwater

398
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
technology

399
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,959
or

400
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,600
air platforms

401
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,720
or

402
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
you could just be in office

403
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
in a military organization anywhere in

404
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,120
the world

405
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
but once you discover

406
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
that you have an issue you have a

407
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
problem you have a compromise or a next

408
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
fill

409
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,279
what do you do do you call anybody

410
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
yeah you're going to call your security

411
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
folks i hope

412
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
and what are your security folks going

413
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
to do

414
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,839
they're going to make recommendations

415
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
they're going to help you get back up to

416
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
running speed

417
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
they're going to

418
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,079
help you remediate your your network and

419
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,199
identify where the bad guys got in

420
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,639
but are you going to notify law

421
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,079
enforcement

422
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,839
are you going to notify

423
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,600
intelligence organizations if you need

424
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
to

425
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
and to what end

426
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,240
what is your network set up like you

427
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,639
have proprietary stuff on the same

428
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
uh location as your hr information i

429
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
hope not but a lot of companies do

430
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
and and to what end to what end of the

431
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
notifications occur

432
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,680
and back in the early 2000s we had

433
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,839
several

434
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,399
investigations

435
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,639
and operations subsequent operations

436
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
where we had companies that

437
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,800
weren't notifying

438
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
law enforcement and counterintelligence

439
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
about their compromises

440
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
and to this day we're still suffering

441
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,600
the effects of it

442
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
conversely

443
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
good example

444
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
your company is

445
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,839
has an issue

446
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
you have an x-fill

447
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
you know you have something like the

448
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
colonial pipeline that was mentioned

449
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
earlier

450
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
who do you notify

451
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,240
i would say notify everybody

452
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,399
does the time in

453
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
position you've been with your company

454
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
two years or 20 years or 40 years does

455
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,360
that matter is it a generational thing

456
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
no but it goes back to a comment that

457
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
was mentioned earlier in terms of trust

458
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
in some ways you trust no one

459
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,839
but in other ways you have to trust

460
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,680
everybody when it comes to

461
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,160
that vulnerability in your network your

462
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,399
system your organization because if

463
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
you've been hit other people probably

464
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
have been hit as well

465
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,639
and that collective

466
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
connection

467
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
has to occur

468
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
for everything to get healthy and for

469
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
you to be ready as i mentioned earlier

470
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
for that next event

471
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
that next compromise

472
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
and there are a lot of different ways i

473
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
won't go through the whole long laundry

474
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
list of them

475
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
where you can connect

476
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,639
but

477
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,279
you know that that old adage you know

478
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,880
you probably need to have that

479
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
relationship before the event occurs

480
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,240
range true every time

481
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
if you don't know who

482
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,199
within government or who within

483
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,880
eight different sectors you're supposed

484
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
to contact when you have a major event

485
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,320
occur

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
now is probably the time to start

487
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,199
thinking about it

488
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,959
you have to have those connections in

489
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,800
place early

490
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
so that you can push and pull

491
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
information

492
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
maybe it's something that's going to

493
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,560
happen over 48 72 hours

494
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,639
the day it happens is not the day to

495
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
start making those phone calls and

496
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
making those connections

497
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
it's better to have those things

498
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,519
established well in place before the

499
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,800
events

500
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
it was mentioned earlier about

501
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
legislation and and rules and

502
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
regulations

503
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
that has to happen way before an event

504
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,519
occurs

505
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
we learned two three five years ago with

506
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,919
a bunch of different events that you all

507
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
know

508
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,119
that

509
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,039
responding

510
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,959
and going to congress if you're in the

511
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
united states or

512
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
your equivalent

513
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,959
during the event is probably not the

514
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,000
time to get things tightened up

515
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
you should probably work on that well in

516
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,799
advance

517
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,559
and i know a lot of groups out there are

518
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,840
doing that

519
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,240
but you have to become one of be part of

520
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,919
one of those groups

521
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,480
and last but not least

522
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,120
as the bad guys get more

523
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,799
aggressive

524
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
we need to be aggressive

525
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
we need to be just as aggressive as they

526
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
are when it comes to

527
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
getting ready for that next event

528
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,000
and that being aggressive

529
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
works hand in hand with innovation

530
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,799
and integration

531
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,240
all of those things happen have to

532
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
happen at the same time for you to be

533
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
effective

534
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,000
and how many people love winning over

535
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
the bad guy right that's everybody

536
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,280
everybody in this room

537
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,000
is employed to do that

538
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,720
but again we only need to make a couple

539
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
of mistakes for our

540
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
our organizations or our networks to be

541
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
compromised

542
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,320
they they've got

543
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
tens of thousands of hundreds and

544
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
millions of events where they're trying

545
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,320
to get into our systems and get our

546
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
information

547
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
so on that note i just want to make sure

548
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,320
that that connection piece

549
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,400
is ingrained in every single one of you

550
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,640
and everybody can do it at any level

551
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,160
so one of the things that and i put this

552
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
here

553
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,520
besides it's a pretty cool slide um

554
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,679
what we do in ncis we want to make sure

555
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,880
that

556
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,400
goes out

557
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,799
and hits the target

558
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,240
we don't want

559
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
when the pushing when the button is

560
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,120
pushed

561
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,840
we don't want clown music to occur

562
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,320
and that's that's key there and you can

563
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,240
substitute whatever you think your

564
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,400
company does and how you push it or your

565
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,320
organization does you want to make sure

566
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
that that goes out and i'm going to tell

567
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320

568
