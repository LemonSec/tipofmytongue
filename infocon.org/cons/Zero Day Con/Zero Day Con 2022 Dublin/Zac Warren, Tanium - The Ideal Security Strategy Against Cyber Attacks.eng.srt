follow up on so i hope i can do a little

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,560
bit of justice and bring a little bit of

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,199
information to you all um so yeah my

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
name is zach warren um i've been with

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,400
tanium for about seven months but i've

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
been using the technology for well over

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
10 years

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,679
i've been utilizing titanium's

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,439
technology within the department of

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,760
defense at the united states within the

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
uh air force of the united states and

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,960
those are some bright lights i can't

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
even see the faces i like to look at

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
people but um but

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
titanium has been able to enable

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
organizations to be able to have a level

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,559
of visibility to be able to bring a

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
level of security maturity into their

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
organizations i'm going to talk a little

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,559
bit about what i've seen in the world

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,760
some of the things that we're dealing

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
with today

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,480
and some of the things that we've

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
actually been uh seeing in the in the

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
wild if you will uh just during uh the

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
past few months with the uh the

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
different crisis if you want to call it

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
a crisis i refer to it as a war that

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
we're having here um in in europe right

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
that is very concerning so let's go

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
ahead and jump right in here

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,560
i

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
read sun tzu when i was a young man um i

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
was probably only like 13 the first time

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,320
i had

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
got the art of war and read that um it

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,520
was very interesting to read that i

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
study a lot of martial arts

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,920
and spent a lot of time in israel doing

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,240
krav maga and this is something that we

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
live by right every battle is won before

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
it even begins you need to be ever or

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,520
before it's even fought you need to be

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
able to see

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
what's going on in your environment you

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
need to have the data and the

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,360
information to be able to react and

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
respond to what's going on in your

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,799
environment so it's the same thing as if

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,360
you're walking down an alleyway right

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,119
and you see a great big guy on the other

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
side of the street you're gonna or on

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,000
your side of the street you're gonna

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
maybe cross the street and walk the you

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
know walk around him you want to avoid

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
that type of uh of problem and it's the

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,560
same thing in our in our um in our

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,160
environments at work

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
so i've heard a lot of talk already

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,280
about who the target is okay so i want

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
to talk a little bit about you know most

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
nations are under attack we see that we

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
see that in the news right as you can

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
tell from my accent i'm from the states

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
we have we're attacked all the time

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
we're doing a lot of attacking right

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
let's not joke around about it we know

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
what's actually going on out there um

73
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
and so

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
organizations are going to be under

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
attack you're going to be under attack

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,319
depending upon what your industry is you

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
might be more of a target than other

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,640
industries right we do know that finance

79
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
for example is a great target because

80
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
they control the money right so you want

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
to make some money let's go to tech

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
finance right it makes sense

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
so we need to be able to start

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
developing a strong negotiation position

85
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
right now i'm not saying that we need to

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
go into negotiation with every

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,959
ransomware gang or that that comes to

88
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,440
kind of you know decrypt or steal our

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
data but we need to be able to have the

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
vision the information be able to have a

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
strategy around how to deal

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
deal with these type of events and

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
attacks so that's what i'm talking about

94
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
with negotiation and i'll and i'll get

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,360
into that a little bit more here in a

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
second

97
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
so when i hear about people talking

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
about ransomware attacks you know people

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
call me all the time friends family

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
people that aren't even in cyber they're

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
like oh my god zac i can't believe it

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,920
somebody paid 4.4 million dollars to a

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
ransomware gang just to get their data

104
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
decrypted what does that mean right and

105
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
they they see that 4.4 million dollars

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
just as an example as being a lot of

107
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
money and it is right but is that the

108
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
real cost of a ransomware attack or

109
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
different cyber attacks absolutely not

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
we're talking about loss of life okay

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
we're talking about organizations

112
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
hospitals that have there's actually

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,120
been hospitals that have because of

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,040
ransomware not being able to give the

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,599
amount or the right type of protection

116
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
to individuals and so we've lost life

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
that way there's been loss of life

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
within the military when it comes to

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
cyber attacks

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
geopolitical reputation or if we look at

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
this from a business perspective

122
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,160
think about the reputation loss okay

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
especially within the supply chain if i

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,479
provide your company with a certain

125
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
component to be able to build your

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
technology

127
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
and i've been hacked and i've been a

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
victim of ransomware are you going to

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
contin want to continue the relationship

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
with me and my organization or is that

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
going to make you think twice right

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
loss of leadership talent we just heard

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
how csos are not sleeping well right so

134
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,080
my experience is that csos tend to have

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
a life expectancy of what nine months

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
and when i say life expectancy i mean

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,639
within the organization right but about

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,560
nine months right because they get in

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
and the ceo says hey the board told me

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
we need to be secure go fix that

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,080
right

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
oh we just got breached you're fired

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
i'm gonna go find me another one right

144
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
how brutal is that you know no thank you

145
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
um

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
legal liability we won't even get into

147
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
that right i have had a customer that

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
got hit by ransomware and it opened up a

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,639
whole can of worms because we found out

150
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
we weren't gdpr compliant

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
right so that was another big

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
check that they had to write to the

153
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
german government and then of course

154
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
data loss

155
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,199
right

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,280
my favorite example of data loss is just

157
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
how well china has been able to grow and

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
develop over the past 10 years and what

159
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,440
is that based on

160
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
what is that growth based on right the

161
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,639
growth is based on stolen ip

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,160
i mean more power to them that's a quick

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
way to get to your end result right so

164
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,840
this is the world that we live in and i

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,199
don't want to be all doom and gloom i

166
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
know we've had enough of that right over

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
the past two years but this is the world

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
that we live in this is what's going on

169
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,919
right this is what we're seeing and of

170
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
course loss of national security that

171
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
happens and of course when we're talking

172
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
about business i've seen organizations

173
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
that have had a ransomware attack

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
they've paid the ransom

175
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
okay because they thought that was the

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
only way they could get their data back

177
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
they tried to decrypt their data it

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
didn't go well

179
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,039
right even if you got the key it doesn't

180
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,560
mean that it's going to be decrypted and

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
everything's going to be you know

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
totally fine like before you got you got

183
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
encrypted

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
right and they were still

185
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
struggling to get their company back up

186
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
and running and the company did go

187
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
bankrupt okay so it doesn't even if you

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
pay the ransom it doesn't mean you're

189
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,479
gonna be okay

190
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,319
all right so let's get over the all the

191
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,199
all the negative negativity right so

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
what's causing all of these attacks it's

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
really what we've heard in the past two

194
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
talks there's a lot of kind of failures

195
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
by our organizations right and i'm not

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
going to point the finger at the at the

197
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
victims and say hey you guys aren't

198
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
doing a good job we're trying to do our

199
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
best we really are we all are okay but

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,000
there are certain things that we need to

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,599
be putting in place there's certain

202
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
levels of visibility that we need to be

203
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,479
developing

204
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
so that we know what's going on within

205
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
our organization so we know how to

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
respond to these attacks

207
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,759
now ransomware is becoming extremely

208
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,440
lucrative so i was with the ministry of

209
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
defense in the czech republic two weeks

210
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,080
ago

211
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,599
and i started joking with a group of

212
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,199
generals and i said did you know that we

213
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
could get on the dark web right now i

214
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
can show you where to download some rat

215
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
tools we can get online and we can make

216
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
some money and they're like oh really

217
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,319
don't tell me more

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,919
and so i had to kind of back them off of

219
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,120
that i was like yeah you know we could

220
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
get some ransomware as a service you

221
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,599
know pay a couple grand you guys got 2

222
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,360
500 bucks i could borrow and i'll get

223
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,039
you some some ransomware as a service

224
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,800
right and we'll go and we'll get some

225
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
we'll you know raise some funds for the

226
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,039
for the military right anyway it was all

227
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
joking we're all having a good time uh

228
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
but uh it's becoming extremely lucrative

229
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
and easy to do malware as a service is

230
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
making things really really easy right

231
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
so it doesn't take

232
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
you know anybody with huge amounts of

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
talent to be able to do these attacks

234
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
but some knowledge of where to find

235
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,560
things

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,599
and then there's the nation state

237
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,639
support

238
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,199
okay there's an unwritten rule in russia

239
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
as long as you're not attacking our

240
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
resources feel free to do what you want

241
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,560
in the west

242
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
right so there's even been talks about

243
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
the cso at tanium and i were just

244
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
talking about this maybe we should

245
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
download as our as our um

246
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
help me with the word with the our

247
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
keyboards as being russian uh

248
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
alphabet because if they see a russian

249
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
alphabet on your laptop they won't

250
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
attack it because they think it's

251
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
russian right so some of the malware has

252
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
that written in the code if you detect

253
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,200
russian uh um alphabet then you don't

254
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,958
attack that system

255
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,240
but don't that doesn't mean to go change

256
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
all your systems to russia good luck

257
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
doing that all right so let's prepare

258
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,919
what are we going to do all right i want

259
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
to bring some positive things to this

260
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
what are we going to do we want to

261
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,640
counteract what's going on okay

262
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,000
so i beg each of one of each of you to

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
really start to build the insights into

264
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,959
your it environment right

265
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,000
understand what you have understand your

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
assets and when i'm talking about assets

267
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
i mean not just all the endpoints not

268
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,279
all your routers and services that's all

269
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
very very very important but understand

270
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
where your data sits understand the

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,320
dependencies on that data for your

272
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
applications and things like that

273
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
then remove and keep out the bad actors

274
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
now here's a quick question when you

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
have uh you respond to an incident and

276
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
you see that you have a bad actor in

277
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,839
your environment and you're able to

278
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
remove them

279
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
how certain are you

280
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
that you have completely removed them

281
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,040
out of your environment

282
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
right scary because a lot of times they

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
find little corners of your environment

284
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
to just kind of sit and hide in the

285
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
shadows and wait for things to calm down

286
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
and then they come and attack you again

287
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
right so we want to make sure that with

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
100 percent

289
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
of uh you know

290
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
capability that we're kicking them out

291
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,800
of our environment

292
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
and then we want to develop

293
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
these different types of measures and

294
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
i'm going to get into what that means

295
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
here it is this is the time

296
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
to pull out your notebooks if you're old

297
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
school like me and write on paper

298
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,360
or get out your phones take some

299
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
pictures i always joke around this one

300
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,720
because it's kind of like the five steps

301
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,399
to getting a six pack right we're not

302
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,680
going to get that here but these are the

303
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,000
five steps things to really keep in mind

304
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
if you want to improve and have an

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
effective and efficient cyber

306
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,920
profile so

307
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
why do i say efficient right effective

308
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
and efficient i say that because

309
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
when

310
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
i'm from west texas so i'm gonna have to

311
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
uh you're gonna have to excuse a little

312
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,519
bit of my uh of my french but when the

313
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,959
 hits the fan

314
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,839
right

315
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,920
you need to have a system you need to

316
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
have a cyber team that is already so

317
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,399
efficient

318
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,800
that they're not to have to shift all of

319
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,079
their focus

320
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,320
right away from what they should be

321
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,279
doing to focus on an attack because

322
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
that's what's going to happen and as you

323
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
shift your focus this needs to be

324
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
running so well like a well-oiled

325
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
machine that's efficient and effective

326
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
so that we can then take resources off

327
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
of it and focus on what the real problem

328
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,800
is

329
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,599
okay here we go

330
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
asset

331
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
you need to understand your assets and

332
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,720
you need to

333
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
figure out what your gaps are in your

334
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,079
environment

335
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,240
understand where you're weak understand

336
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
what you need to be building on okay one

337
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,279
of my favorite things um i you can't

338
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
tell because uh i've been in i've been

339
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,440
in in europe for two years now but i

340
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,839
used to do a lot of a lot of crossfit

341
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
right have you guys there's much

342
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
crossfit going on in ireland these days

343
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
no maybe so but one of the worst things

344
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,480
about going to crossfit is they try to

345
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
figure out what your weakness is and

346
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
then they make you do that 115 times

347
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
right it's horrible it's the worst thing

348
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
in the world i hate running and so what

349
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,440
do they make me do they made me run

350
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
every time i came to the came to the box

351
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,279
right so understand what your weaknesses

352
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,120
are and then focus on those

353
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,519
fix those weaknesses

354
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
improve your i.t hygiene we heard about

355
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
this just now from our two previous

356
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
speakers it hygiene is a huge huge issue

357
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,279
whenever i talk to organizations csos

358
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,880
tell me yeah zach i've got somewhere

359
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,639
between 100 100 000 150 000 endpoints

360
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,519
oh that's kind of a big

361
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,440
100 or 150 000 right um smaller

362
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,040
organizations yeah i think i've got

363
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
about 4 000 endpoints well that's not a

364
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,320
very precise number you know do you have

365
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,000
3722 or you know what i mean so let's

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
understand more about what we actually

367
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
have in our environments and then let's

368
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,959
make sure that those

369
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
systems are up to date that they've got

370
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,120
the latest and greatest patches on them

371
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
or however we you know what we just

372
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
redeem as what's what's right for our

373
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,399
environments

374
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
and then develop this strong negotiation

375
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
uh position what has which has a lot to

376
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
do with having that visibility that

377
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,720
knowledge so one of the most frustrating

378
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,959
things is when the fbi shows up at your

379
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,800
door right or europol i work very

380
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
closely with europol in germany

381
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
and when they come up to you and they

382
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
say hey we need this information

383
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
and most organizations are like uh i

384
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
don't even know how to get you that

385
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
information or

386
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
coach me on on how to gather that type

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,639
of data we need to start building up

388
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,880
ways of being able to support

389
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,959
our law enforcement with that type of

390
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,800
that type of data okay so you need to

391
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
have that level of visibility again i

392
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
talked about defense needs to be

393
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
efficient

394
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,519
and then finally re-evaluate

395
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
your endpoint tools okay this one is the

396
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
most important one for me right and i

397
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,800
know i'm standing in between us and

398
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
lunch right so i'm going to try to just

399
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
you know bring this last message across

400
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,959
the thing of it is is if your endpoint

401
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,600
security technology lost visibility at

402
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,720
all in 2020 you know when the crisis was

403
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
really kicking our butts and everybody

404
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
was working from home right and all

405
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,279
these organizations were really

406
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
struggling to keep to keep an eye on

407
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,399
what was going on i have customers that

408
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,600
you know they couldn't get enough

409
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,959
laptops

410
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,279
to send their people home with so we had

411
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,959
people working from

412
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,120
you know from their own personal laptops

413
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,600
or you know borrowing some from from

414
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
from friends or family or whatever right

415
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,120
you start to lose visibility of what's

416
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,519
actually going on in your environment

417
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,160
and so if you've lost visibility

418
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
you need to look at re-evaluating that

419
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
endpoint solution okay

420
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
if you were

421
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
if you have to do a lot of care and

422
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,480
feeding and constant management of the

423
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
of your endpoint tool

424
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,079
there's other products out there we just

425
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
heard about some great products that are

426
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,279
able to really pull in all of that data

427
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,040
and give you that level of visibility

428
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
constantly okay so make sure that you're

429
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
looking at all these different things

430
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
make sure that you're evaluating your

431
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
product sets put the oems

432
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
put their feet to the fire challenge

433
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
them make sure that they're giving you

434
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
the best support that they can possibly

435
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,519
give you right demand that from them

436
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
right i tell my my customers all the

437
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,720
time demand excellence from from our

438
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,760
team

439
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
right so from tanium from a tania

440
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
perspective i know most of you just a

441
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,120
show of hands i can kind of see people

442
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,880
who's actually heard obtainium before i

443
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,399
got up here

444
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,120
oh wow i feel good about that that makes

445
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,360
me happy because in germany if i was to

446
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,800
do the same thing i live in hamburg

447
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,560
germany now if i was to do the same

448
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
thing there would be no hands up right

449
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,199
first of all that's because they're

450
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
german second of all it's because we

451
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,000
we're not that well known in emea yet

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
right in the states were were uh

453
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
titanium's fairly well known but what

454
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
tanium is going to be able to do is give

455
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,959
you these things be able to give you

456
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
that level of visibility into your

457
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
environment even breaking into the ot

458
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,079
iot environments helping you be able to

459
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
have that level of visibility so that

460
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,079
you can make sure that you have the

461
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,240
right patches on these devices so you

462
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
can make sure that you have the

463
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,800
visibility of the different

464
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
vulnerabilities in your environment and

465
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,639
so that you can react to those and get

466
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
those patched and squared away as fast

467
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,120
as possible okay so i really appreciate

468
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,880
the time thank you all for being here

469

thank you for being so

470
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
adamant about being involved in cyber

471
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
security it's a passion of mine if you

472
