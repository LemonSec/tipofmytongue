1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,240
so a couple of things before i start my

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,639
name's adrian cottrell and i the cio at

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,280
the institute of cancer research um if i

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,639
could ask them to give me a five-minute

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,080
warning so i stayed at time i'd be

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,759
looking out for the signal and the

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,039
second thing just to let people know in

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,039
terms of the prize for the best tweet

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,640
i've given up twitter for lent so it's

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,400
not going to be me the field is open

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,279
there

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,439
um i'd like to do uh

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
four things today first of all i'd like

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,560
to tell you a little bit about what the

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
institute of cancer research is

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
i'd like to talk to you about the

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,800
threats cyber presents to us and you can

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,360
probably guess that from um you know the

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
talks been given so far

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,719
um i'd like to tell you about the

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,800
journey my organization has been on and

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,399
lastly i'll throw out a challenge to you

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
all in the room about the role you can

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,960
play to help research organizations like

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
my own

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
so first of all the ico or the institute

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,280
of cancer research um what is it well if

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
you if you get cancer and you're in

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
london the the likelihood is you'll be

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
directed to the rural mars and hospital

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,559
and about 70 years ago um it was agreed

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
that the research part of the hospital

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
should be spun off to what is the icr

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
the institute of cancer research so in

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
the morning we have some of the best

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
people you know in in their field

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
telling life and death decisions to

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
patients and then they have a research

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,520
team across the bridge in the afternoon

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
and that's where we have

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,200
about 1500 um

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,759
scientists uh staff and students working

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,119
at the institute

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,119
it's a non-profit organization but quite

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,240
quite a few of these research

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
organizations that operate in this way

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,920
and you can imagine in the current

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
climate with the way fundraising and

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,119
things have gone in the last couple of

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,000
years it is grim out there actually for

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
all of these sort of sorts of research

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
institutions

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
um but about the ico it's it's what we

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,479
call the comprehensive uh cancer center

55
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
this is about going from the the bench

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,000
the research you know

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
increasingly doing less in the test tube

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
and more on in silica but but also going

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
all the way through to the the patient

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
at the bedside

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
and if you look at the papers and

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
publications and citations

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
globally the icr comes third fourth

64
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,639
globally so we're kind of a hidden

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,399
secret there the big american

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
institutions with huge budgets the ones

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
that stand in front of us

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,480
um just say then that we are um

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
reading my writing yeah we're a global

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,560
organization so we have

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,920
staff and students from over 50

72
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
countries and we're collaborating with

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
people all around the world one thing

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
you will find is oncologists kind of

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,319
different from other researchers they

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
are literally dealing with life and

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
death decisions almost every minute of

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,519
every day and they're more likely to

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
give you their home number but approach

80
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
you with research because they're

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
literally trying to save lives and it it

82
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
becomes personal um and so the the fight

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,640
for discoveries is a global effort

84
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,480
across the board

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,519
and in terms of the uk about 50 of the

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,760
practicing oncologists in the uk will

87
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
have done a post-doc or a masters in the

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
icr so it's like the finishing school

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,000
for oncologists

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
a couple of achievements that we've done

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
um the icr were the first organization

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
to publish about the

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
linkage between

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
cancer and cigarette smoking we were the

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
first organization to say that dna

96
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
damage was a root cause of cancer

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,599
and we also have um let me pick out a

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,280
couple we were the first organization to

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,239
pick out the braca gene therapy which is

100
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,239
crucial to towards all the therapies

101
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,400
that gone towards breast cancer

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
we are doing amazing amazing stuff

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
around radiotherapy at the moment and

104
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
sadly most of you will know this but if

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
you get cancer it's surgery it's chemo

106
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,599
and radiotherapy and the the the

107
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
advances in technology in recent years

108
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
has really pushed radiotherapy to the

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,319
fore and i'll give you a couple of

110
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,400
examples in a moment and um finally uh

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
in terms of prosecute prostate cancer

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
and we really have come up with some of

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
some of the best drugs in the market and

114
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
licensed those through j and others and

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,359
that's having great impact

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
so i just

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
advanced the slide yeah so let me just

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
say about you know the the number this

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
the story and that's about

120
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
technology evolution clearly gives

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
better outcomes from cancer patients so

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
if you look on the on the x-axis you see

123
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
technology advances over the last 20-30

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
years on the y-axis you see the

125
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
collaboration and it wasn't that long

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
ago clinical trials and so on they're

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
all written down in paper forms you know

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
and it was all very what can you do in

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
its paper barely anyone's reading the

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
paper that someone wrote the day before

131
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,000
but as things got

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
digitalized we got systems that were

133
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
bespoke within organizations those

134
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,120
solutions started to get bit more

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
networked so you could share systems

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
share data

137
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
in the last five ten years huge amounts

138
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
of data so in my previous role i was

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
in charge of clinical trials and

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
development within gsk and i remember

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,479
being faced five years ago with this

142
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,919
challenge about how do we store these

143
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,160
medical images they're just so big these

144
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
files where do you they're just off the

145
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
scale compared to where we were before

146
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
where i am now at the institute it's

147
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
videos of these things because cancer

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
doesn't just sit there waiting to be

149
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
taken it moves around and if you kind of

150
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
do radiotherapy you've got to know where

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
it is so so actually it's a very dynamic

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
field with huge data volumes being

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
generated

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
and then finally you know what we're

155
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
seeing is and i'll show you a few

156
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
examples in a moment through the use of

157
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
aim and machine learning we were able to

158
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
really really improve the outcomes for

159
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,240
patients

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
but unfortunately at all this time with

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
all this fantastic technology and all

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
this big global collaboration

163
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
cyber risk is just a nightmare and this

164
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
is this is really putting the brakes on

165
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,000
a lot of what we do i i am constantly

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
having to tell my scientists who just

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
want to get on with things you've got to

168
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,840
take care you know we've heard ronan and

169
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,680
others earlier on today about one

170
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
careless email and the whole institute

171
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
could be brought down and it's really

172
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
hard to tell people who are trying to

173
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
save lives they've got to be a bit more

174
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
careful it's really difficult but that's

175
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
that's the role i have to play

176
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,319
so let me give you a couple of examples

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,440
about some of the breakthroughs that

178
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,720
we're doing and this hopefully some

179
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
encouragement for for all of us as we go

180
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
through

181
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,360
you will probably know that if you get

182
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,840
breast cancer or lung cancer obviously

183
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,319
the origin of it is quite well known but

184
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,000
actually it can move to other parts of

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
the body and metastasize in different

186
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
ways and so you've got to look for it

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
everywhere it is and a key aid to this

188
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,120
in radiotherapy is full body mri

189
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
where you look at the whole body and you

190
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
can see all the sights of the infection

191
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
you can see that rotating body will show

192
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
you that that case where the cancer is

193
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,440
showing up

194
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
and um

195
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,840
what we're finding now through ai is you

196
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
used to have to spend about half an hour

197
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
in the mri machine to get enough images

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
to do the full body we can now get that

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
down to five minutes when you think this

200
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
is somebody that's a patient probably in

201
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,319
chronic pain that's supposed to stay

202
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,520
still

203
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
that is actually a big move forward and

204
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
we're going to reduce that all the time

205
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
we're also doing work to make other

206
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
equipment ct scans which are much more

207
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
available try to use ai to simulate an

208
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,039
mri full body scan from a ct scan so

209
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,520
this is really clever stuff and what's

210
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
really fantastic about this is if you

211
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,639
get somebody currently who may be

212
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,319
diagnosed with cancer maybe given told

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
they've got three months six months nine

214
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,280
months to live

215
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,039
all you know conventional therapies out

216
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,120
of the way they're given experimental

217
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
treatment perhaps in a clinical trial

218
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
and normally what would happen is you'd

219
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
have to give them the medicine and you

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
every day counts right you give them the

221
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
medicine for six weeks eight weeks to

222
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
see how they are and then you have to

223
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
monitor how are you feeling to see how

224
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,520
it goes

225
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,759
with full body mri we can track it

226
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,000
straight away and we can know that as we

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
get data after two weeks three weeks you

228
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
should start to see signs of this this

229
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
having an effect and if it's not let's

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
get you off that and get you on

231
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,960
something else because they just don't

232
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
have the time so you can see this is

233
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
fantastic research that we're doing here

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,120
so yeah that's the thing about it going

235
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
down to five minutes

236
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,919
another thing i want to talk to you

237
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,599
about two quick other things um to

238
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
mention too one is uh the traditional

239
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
way of

240
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
if someone has cancer is you have a

241
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
biopsy and the way in which biopsy

242
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
happens then is take the biopsy you

243
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
slice it down you put it on a slide you

244
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
stay in it and then you look to see

245
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,080
whether there are cancerous cells in the

246
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
in the on the slide and um increasingly

247
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,240
there is a shortage of pathologists to

248
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
do this work but this is a massive

249
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
opportunity as you can imagine for ml

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,479
and ai so as we build this global bank

251
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,800
these biobanks of samples what you can

252
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,199
do is take the sample run it through and

253
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,800
within minutes find out this is

254
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
definitely not cancer this is definitely

255
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
cancer this might be cancer so then you

256
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
train your machine learning to be better

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
at that and then you refer them to a

258
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
specialist so that that gives much

259
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
quicker diagnosis and in the very same

260
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
way with cyber threats early detection

261
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,360
is really important to have good

262
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
outcomes

263
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,320
and we can add to that because with the

264
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
the again sharing of data around best

265
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
therapies we can look at the genotype

266
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,839
and phenotype of the individual and say

267
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
yes you've got this sort of cancer and

268
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
for you for you these are the best

269
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,120
therapies for you based on global

270
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
information so we're going away from the

271
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
the knowledge of one

272
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,600
oncologist to a patient to harvesting

273
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
the information from the whole world and

274
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
i think you can appreciate that is a

275
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,080
very powerful way to proceed

276
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
and the final thing to say on this one

277
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
is individually we've got great

278
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
radiologists we've got great

279
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
pathologists we've got great uh people

280
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
looking at the genetics side of things

281
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
and at the moment when people get

282
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
together they have a meeting and people

283
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
cut and paste from powerpoint to try and

284
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,279
say here's what we're seeing and it's

285
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,120
static what we're going to do you can

286
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
imagine is make this integrated

287
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
diagnostic so you've got real-time way

288
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
of looking at the data to give much

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,839
better outcomes for the patients

290
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
so let me just quickly in the last five

291
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,120
minutes i have talked a little bit about

292
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,160
the journey because this is probably

293
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
stuff that you will know but when i

294
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
started out on this journey at the icr i

295
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
had quite a lot of resistance you know

296
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
it hasn't happened here why are you

297
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
doing to this to me we're trying to help

298
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
patients by trying to describe this as

299
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
the the balloon that's about to burst

300
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,440
you know and when it does it's a bang

301
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
and life is different i had at gsk a a

302
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,839
really horrible cyber incident

303
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,920
then i tell people offline about that

304
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,040
and once you've been through one of

305
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,959
those you you never forget it because

306
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
after it happens everyone says well why

307
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
didn't you tell us if we'd have known

308
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
that well we can spend any money you

309
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
know we'd have spent any money then you

310
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,200
know if we'd have known but it's too

311
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,160
late the balloon is burst

312
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
so so what did we do um the first thing

313
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
i had to do is get a kind of a sense

314
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,800
check of where we were in terms of our

315
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,839
cyber maturity um i engaged accenture to

316
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,519
do that i thought external credibility

317
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
might help me there we identified our

318
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
top 10 risks you could probably guess

319
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,640
what some of them were we sort of knew

320
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,079
but again we wanted to make sure people

321
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
went on the journey we identified

322
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,360
recommendations to address those risks

323
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,519
um and we laid out sort of a costing

324
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,680
plan to make it happen

325
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
um we also uh

326
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,399
we got approval for the investment and

327
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
what we did realize of course is this

328
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,279
there's an insider threat which is key

329
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,320
part to this but also we needed to

330
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
introduce greater technology and we made

331
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,320
a conscious decision just

332
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,760
coming back to the previous speaker to

333
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
go with an mmsp model rather than try to

334
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
hire in and actually for us that was the

335
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
best decision because we also did agree

336
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
to augment our internal team but

337
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
recruitment is really hard and we don't

338
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,640
pay you know the same rates as industry

339
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,800
so i think the mmsp model actually works

340
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
for institutions like us

341
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
um and what we also then did then was um

342
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,519
the we have pointed a see so we had

343
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
somebody actually who was in role but as

344
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,680
we made the role the team bigger we put

345
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,959
that in place

346
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
we went after the insider threat really

347
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
hard right from the get-go and as ronan

348
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
and others mentioned this was all going

349
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
on during the pandemic

350
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
um we looked at all our policies we went

351
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
right after our acceptable use policy

352
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
and did a big launch campaign because it

353
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,959
was ten years out of date and people

354
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,560
were doing all sorts of things they

355
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,720
really shouldn't um we then run a

356
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
campaign of cyber hygiene we called it

357
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
and we said this is not just about when

358
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
you're at work it's about in your own

359
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
private life too it's about phishing and

360
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
being aware of what goes on there it's

361
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
about using strong passwords and what to

362
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
look out for and initially we had very

363
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,240
low attendance but um we had a town hall

364
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
meeting and i kind of scared the bejesus

365
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
out of them and we had everyone turn up

366
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
and those have been very successful

367
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,160
since

368
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
and we really did fish a ramp up our

369
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,399
fishing campaign um to the point where

370
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
our stats are looking pretty good now i

371
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,079
mean you only need one but they're

372
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,320
looking very good compared to the sector

373
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
and now we're looking at the next stage

374
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,279
about you know what is the impact if you

375
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,040
constantly fail some of these who are

376
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
the worst offenders what are the

377
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
implications you put the organization at

378
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,920
risk you know when someone was lighting

379
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,079
matches you'd do something about it so

380
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,839
we're thinking about that and of course

381
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,040
we um

382
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
brought on um

383
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,279
made our mmsp selection

384
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
um msp selection was smart tech through

385
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
a rfi process and we've been working

386
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
over the last year on that that was

387
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
formally launched just about a year ago

388
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
we have the 24 7 monitoring which gives

389
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
us comfort um we established the log

390
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
transfer i think about 90 of our log

391
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
files are now out there and being

392
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
managed the scene we set our

393
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,320
vulnerability management and we're we're

394
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,079
halfway through our pam implementation

395
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,839
at the same time

396
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,760
i think it's fair to say that when you

397
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
if you're going on this journey there's

398
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
there's pain first so there's the

399
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,519
ignorant incompetence once you know what

400
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,279
you've got then you've got to fix it so

401
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,720
i think we're sort of on our way through

402
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,399
that part of the journey but we've seen

403
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
some pretty good inroads on a number of

404
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
fronts now

405
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
and then finally in terms of what we do

406
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
it's about monitoring and improving and

407
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
so you know um it was great help from um

408
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
smart tech that we got early warnings

409
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,560
around solarwinds and log4j we have

410
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
weekly tactical meetings about what we

411
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
should do we have quarterly reviews and

412
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
we get the forecasting that helps us

413
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
engage with our senior organization so

414
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
in the last 20 seconds or so that i have

415
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
and i see the clock it's kept me in good

416
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
time let me just say a little thing to

417
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
you all probably all of you have been

418
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
where i've been where you've been at a

419
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,480
funeral or you've heard some terrible

420
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
news about somebody who has got an

421
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
ailment and you just say to yourself if

422
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
there's only something i could do i feel

423
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
so useless we've probably all been there

424
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
let me tell you two things there are two

425
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
things you can do if you're working in

426
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
cyber and looking at solutions

427
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,519
institutions like mine really need all

428
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,880
the stuff that you're doing it and i

429
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,160
would just ask if you can do it at a

430
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
price we can afford because pockets are

431
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
small

432
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
and if you can't do that

433
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,079
donate to the charity that means

434
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,160
something to you those charities or the

435
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
research organizations excuse me they

436
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
are really struggling out there so

437
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,560
whether it's icr or somewhere else they

438
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,880
need your help
