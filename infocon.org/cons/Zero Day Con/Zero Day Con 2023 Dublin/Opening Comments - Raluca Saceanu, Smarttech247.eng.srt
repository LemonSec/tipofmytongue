2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,179
good morning everyone and welcome to

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,019
zero daycon in 2022 the world has

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,199
redefined what disruption means and the

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,480
leading cause of that is the war in

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,539
Ukraine this kind of disruption shows

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,600
that cyber security is as much impacted

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,779
by geopolitical events as it is by

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,939
technological advancements

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,679
it was a turbulent here for many

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,719
organizations across the world we saw

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,719
critical operations being brought down

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,820
we saw sensitive data being compromised

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,579
a whole country going offline and also

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,219
we saw

16
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,280
advancements in in cyber War but also

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,440
technologies that we use and we trust in

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,180
our operations in our day-to-day

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,520
operations were being attacked and

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,020
weaponized

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,239
and right now

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,660
the world is facing several major crises

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,219
at the same time and what has been

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,319
coined a poly crisis

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,640
Rising inflation supply chain disruption

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,720
energy shocks and cyber War

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,000
Russia has Unleashed not only its

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,960
kinetic efforts and and War efforts in

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
Ukraine but also its cyber efforts

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
and this means that it the the the

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,860
height of these uh cyber efforts are

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,540
threatening our uh position today and we

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,520
the the consequences of the Cyber War

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,380
are showing that we are all connected at

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,720
a global level what happens in one

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,240
country in one organization across the

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,159
world can affect us all not only

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,259
economically but it can also potentially

39
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,420
disrupt our lives and this is exactly

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,659
why we've chosen connect as this year's

41
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,040
theme for zero day

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,259
the reality is that organizations are

43
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,759
constantly playing catch-up when it

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,380
comes to cyber security

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,479
if there's anything that research shows

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,840
it is that cons change is the only

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,700
constant and or fishing is rising as a

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,220
result of all of the disruptions that

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,900
are happening at the moment

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,940
supply chain attacks are rising business

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,160
email compromise is growing

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,220
significantly we've seen several cases

53
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,620
where individual business email

54
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,099
compromised have resulted in in millions

55
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,420
uh in terms of losses

56
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,000
stolen personal data is being

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,280
compromised and exfiltrated on the dark

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,400
web and the academic sector is a prime

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
target for that data

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,900
and ransomware deployments are now much

61
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,379
faster than they were five years ago

62
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,360
but there are three key factors that are

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,420
shaping the macro uh three key macro

64
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,940
Trends are shaping the industry today

65
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,160
first of all Security leaders need to

66
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,660
prioritize the

67
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,099
maintaining a visibility in governance

68
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,260
over their data their systems and their

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,900
third parties because of this constant

70
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,659
digitalization of Business Systems the

71
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,080
on on-demand information systems and the

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,599
data that is sprawled across multiple

73
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,580
environments and this means that

74
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,220
organizations need to look at this risk

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,080
from a very Dynamic perspective because

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,720
these environments are quite dynamic

77
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,300
geopolitical instability is continuing

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
to fuel the Cyber War

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,920
and this may take many different forms

80
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,760
from DDOS attacks to misinformation

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,340
campaigns and to potentially destructive

82
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,620
attacks on critical infrastructure

83
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,260
what this means for the industry is that

84
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,420
there are more and more Innovative and

85
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,879
destructive methods of releasing cyber

86
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,220
attacks but not only that it also means

87
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,580
that cyber criminals are now using these

88
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,440
tools that eventually get dumped on the

89
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,920
dark web tools used by nation states to

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,519
create more commoditized cyber crime

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,860
the global skill shortage is a massive

92
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,900
problem for the industry there are 3.5

93
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,260
million jobs that are open now in cyber

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,720
security and this means that

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,238
organizations need to increase their

96
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,820
automation efforts but also it means

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,360
that by 2024 more than 75 of

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
organizations worldwide will Outsource

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,979
their cyber security

100
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,259
in order to navigate these challenges

101
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,780
Security leaders are adapting their

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,360
approaches and they're elevating their

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,600
risk management approaches

104
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,240
first of all security is complex it's

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,520
it's very difficult to solve all

106
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,759
security problems and what organizations

107
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,919
are now looking at is optimizing their

108
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,139
cyber security efforts simplifying their

109
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,720
cyber security and removing unnecessary

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,600
complexities and this means a

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
consolidation of security tools this

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,660
this means adoption of more holistic

113
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,580
cyber security Frameworks such as cyber

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,440
security mesh architecture

115
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
improving resilience is also key

116
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,880
if you read the national cyber security

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,400
strategy that was recently released by

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,979
The Biden Harris Administration and it's

119
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,199
not a very lengthy document you'll see

120
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,539
the word resilience being mentioned 72

121
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,360
times in this in this document

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,639
it's not a matter of if it's not even a

123
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,320
matter of when anymore it's it's a

124
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,660
matter of how you handle when an

125
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,759
incident happens

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,460
cyber risk is now on the agenda for

127
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,740
every board meeting across the world

128
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,800
and organizations are approaching it

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,300
from a different perspective than they

130
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,280
than they were two years ago they're

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,580
looking at their key initiatives in a

132
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,560
more focused way they're looking at

133
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,639
their threat and vulnerability

134
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,860
Management Programs they're looking at

135
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,720
their data programs they're looking at

136
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,660
Cloud third parties and the reality is

137
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,759
that you can't use the same approach for

138
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,860
all of these key initiatives but one of

139
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,259
the most important items that is

140
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,500
changing is the fact that more and more

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,780
organizations in csos are trying to

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,120
embed cyber security culture into their

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,259
entire organization

144
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,000
data security

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,100
is seeing a shift as well and the

146
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,680
interesting part is that

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,440
a few years ago organizations were

148
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,080
asking questions like okay if there's an

149
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,180
attack how can we restore the data do

150
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,220
what is our backup what does it look

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,319
like is it healthy how long does it take

152
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,440
to restore but because of these constant

153
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,020
disruptions what we're seeing now is

154
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,080
they're moving from for more from a more

155
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,120
reactive state to a more proactive State

156
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,220
and the questions are changing the

157
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,740
questions are how do we prevent data

158
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,080
compromise in the in the event that we

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,539
face on attack

160
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,759
what this is showing us all of these

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
Trends all of these priorities is that

162
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,740
cyber security is not just a tech

163
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,259
problem anymore gaps are not addressed

164
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,560
by technology alone and Security leaders

165
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,440
are looking at their risk posture more

166
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
holistically and they're looking at

167
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,500
their business functions and they're

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,139
asking themselves questions like what

169
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,000
are our critical operations how do we

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,639
secure them what do we fix first because

171
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
it's impossible to fix everything and

172
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,199
how can we stay one step ahead of the

173
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,919
Cyber enemy

174
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,479
companies are spending large amounts of

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,340
money on threat intelligence every year

176
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,000
millions and when we ask them how have

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,639
you changed your cyber security

178
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,740
protections and strategies on the basis

179
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,139
of this intelligence most of the time

180
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,539
the answers are limited

181
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,460
companies need to take the threat

182
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,680
intelligence they consume they need to

183
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
analyze it and they need to use it to

184
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,139
form their basis of their

185
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,060
strategic initiatives in order to fight

186
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,860
the Cyber enemy

187
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,840
and the Cyber enemy does not look like

188
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,419
this but rather like this it's a

189
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,240
hyper-connected criminal system most

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,720
often fueled by Russia China North Korea

191
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,300
with effective operations that run very

192
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,759
similarly to how a normal business runs

193
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,979
with tech departments with data

194
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,020
governance departments with customer

195
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,199
service even HR

196
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,440
and this is exactly why cyber crime will

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,740
cost the world 10 trillion by 2025.

198
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,820
at the start of my presentation I

199
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,279
mentioned disruption and throughout I

200
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
emphasized the need for resilience and

201
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,080
the reality is that there's a large

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,360
disconnect between disruption and

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,380
resilience and connecting the two means

204
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,000
recognizing that organizations can

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,180
respond in ways that not only will help

206
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,640
them overcome their challenges but also

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,519
learn how to build the capacity to

208
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,519
navigate challenges in the future in the

209
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,120
event of other disruptions

210
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,880
because resilience isn't about just

211
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,040
bouncing back from a crisis from A

212
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,380
disruption it's about building cyber

213
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,200
risk management systematic crisis

214
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,779
management and building cyber culture

215
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,000
within an organization

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,700
enjoy the day

217
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,740
foreign

218
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:34,010
