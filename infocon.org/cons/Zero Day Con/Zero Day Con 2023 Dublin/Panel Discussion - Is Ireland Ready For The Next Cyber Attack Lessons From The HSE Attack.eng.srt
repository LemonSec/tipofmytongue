[Music]

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,720
let's let's focus on now first of all

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,280
before we go back

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,860
how robust is the system now compared to

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,859
how robust it was when the attacker

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,560
found the vulnerability

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,560
um I think robust is maybe a word

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,359
um I wouldn't focus on I think in terms

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,400
of there is still a lot of Legacy

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,340
technology in the health sector and that

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,840
is going to take

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,540
um some time to address I would say in

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,820
terms of the defense mechanisms we have

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,340
we are much better so at the time the

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,020
attack

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,940
um we didn't have 24 7 security

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,760
operations we didn't have continuous

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,480
monitoring and we have all that now and

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,360
so we are defensively in a better

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,399
posture but there's still a lot of work

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,920
to be done and I'm one of the things we

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,420
like one of the first things I did when

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,980
I came into my role

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,079
um was actually trying to address the

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,660
investment and governance required from

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,820
a cyber perspective so that was actually

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,500
working on an investment case and laying

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,060
down to government and say this is

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,220
actually what we're going to need over a

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,659
number of years because this can't be

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,060
fixed in one year we are better but we

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,439
need to continue to invest this is a

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,659
this is a continuous game you know they

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,939
get better we need to respond but it's a

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,500
prime example we talked a lot about it

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,439
earlier of uh it's hard to justify the

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,360
spend until something goes wrong in

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
cyber security

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,299
is pushing an open door I'm guessing now

40
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,619
because we never want to go back to

41
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,479
where we were I'm presuming it's easier

42
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,579
for you to go in and say we need to

43
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,140
spend this amount of that amount or we

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,579
need to upgrade this system or there's a

45
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,140
vulnerability there please say it's

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,659
gotten easier it's gotten easier I think

47
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,000
there's a question of quantum of how

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
much

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,060
um because it is public money

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,579
um so yes there is an appetite to invest

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,820
but then actually in terms of how much

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,200
um and the order and the number of years

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,240
and what we're prioritizing that's still

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,820
you know we are I suppose

55
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,500
working with government to try and

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,720
address that because like I said you

57
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,700
know we have 70 000 endpoints on our

58
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,740
environments you know it's four thousand

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,380
locations so it's a vast estate that's a

60
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,420
lot of vulnerability it's a potential

61
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,040
vulnerability yeah yeah

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,379
um and we have to do that in in a

63
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,000
sequence in order way so we've been as I

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
said we've been very focused on you know

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,080
getting better defense and separately

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,599
also addressing Legacy

67
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,819
um and doing the two parts in parallel

68
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,140
to make sure that we're improving things

69
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,000
and making sure we don't have you know

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,280
we're reducing the attack surface but

71
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,660
also making sure we've got people making

72
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,400
sure I'm monitoring things I mean there

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,959
is a statistic I'll just give it to you

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
again to size the estate there with the

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
monitoring we have in place uh in 12

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,700
months we've had 46 000 alerts across

77
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,099
the environment forty six thousands wow

78
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,060
of those 46 000 about 12 100 of them

79
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,459
would we categorized as priority alerts

80
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,099
and 200 of those approximately turn into

81
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,360
investigations

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,700
so I said are we are we better prepared

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,620
for cyber Tech we are under constant

84
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,239
attack but actually we're in a better

85
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,800
position to identify them and contain

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,540
one of the things before I move on to

87
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,680
the rest of the panel that has come up

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,500
time time again is empowering people

89
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,780
throughout the chain to report up

90
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,340
without fear of getting into trouble

91
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,800
going I think this is an issue

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
has that helped your cause and do people

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,180
are people more likely now to go this

94
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,440
didn't look right to me I didn't click

95
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,000
on it but I'm sending it to you out of

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
alarm absolutely one of the things we've

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,180
done

98
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,840
um we have uh fishing campaigns every

99
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,420
two months and again this is this is 90

100
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,920
000 people

101
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,500
um I can tell you the amount of cars to

102
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,540
come to the call center flooding them

103
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,099
saying I think this is a fishing and

104
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,599
we're like Happy Days that's great

105
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,420
because people are more aware now and

106
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,040
and if we look at the statistics of the

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
people clicking through we're lower than

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,099
the industry average I think the

109
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,720
industry average everyone has different

110
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,000
stats but it's a the one we're looking

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,980
at is with 12 will click through despite

112
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,200
you've trained them we're lower than

113
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,580
that at the moment

114
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,080
um but we need to keep doing it but

115
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,599
actually we we tend to overwhelm the

116
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,340
people on the service desk and that's a

117
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,560
good thing so yes I think there's PTSD

118
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,700
in the system which is why they're so

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,099
good at responding I did slice Beaumont

120
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,140
Hospital earlier and their cios in the

121
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,879
room it wasn't Beaumont hospital where

122
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
somebody clicked the button and the

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,940
whole thing fell apart I don't know

124
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,560
where it was now I can't remember it

125
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,060
wasn't either the two who were with me

126
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,740
here so I'll move safely on and say

127
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,240
Beaumont Hospital therapy sorry someone

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,020
else

129
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,919
um David

130
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,800
for Italian University hospital

131
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,199
um you guys had a particularly robust

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,580
systems in place I know I haven't spoken

133
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,040
to you there it the whole idea of the

134
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,080
HSC attack what impact did it have on

135
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,360
the thought processes within your

136
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,259
hospital

137
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,560
uh well I suppose the first thing to to

138
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,419
just preface my comments with is that

139
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,800
Healthcare is very resilient you've got

140
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
a very dedicated Healthcare staff at

141
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,120
this country so I just want to put

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,440
everybody at ease that no matter what

143
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,120
happens you know the doctors the nurses

144
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
the physios everybody is there for the

145
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
patient and Care continued throughout

146
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
the Cyber attack and I think that was

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,259
evidence last week by what happened in

148
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,520
Wexford with the fire so it's very

149
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,199
important to put put that out there and

150
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,479
I think that needs recognition in terms

151
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,240
of the tall process yes it certainly

152
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,919
heightened the awareness within the

153
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,560
organization but also that is not an I.T

154
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,419
problem it was mentioned earlier that

155
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,919
the attack factors are changing and

156
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,380
you've seen this there are examples

157
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,520
around the world where they are

158
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,680
targeting medical devices so they're not

159
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,880
coming in the straight front door

160
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,020
because they're coming in through iot

161
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,699
exactly and they're also coming in

162
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,160
through your third-party supplier so

163
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,139
like if you look at the Target hack a

164
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,880
few years ago they came into I think it

165
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,900
was a building management system

166
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,759
provider and they were there Gathering

167
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,840
credit card data I think for

168
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,060
approximately six months so while it's

169
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,039
done is why we and I think you had the

170
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,620
analogy earlier and it's a bit like if

171
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,300
anybody remembers we're going Aces get

172
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,919
smart and the number of doors this is

173
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,720
this is our sixth pop culture reference

174
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
from the 80s young people look it up so

175
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,919
you take the number of doors he used to

176
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,020
walk through

177
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,880
so we strengthened the front door so all

178
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,960
they've done that was they're going in

179
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,039
the back door they're going in the

180
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,600
window they're going in the side door so

181
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,820
while it's done it certainly create that

182
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,259
awareness that we need to look Beyond

183
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,900
I.T and look at our suppliers look at

184
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,639
our partners look at our medical device

185
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,740
suppliers and and further stretching

186
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,780
those areas but because of the passage

187
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,759
of time and the return to normality um

188
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,199
we forgot that this happened in the

189
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,759
middle of covert as well so the hospital

190
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,620
system was already Under Pressure you

191
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,240
guys to be fair and taller you had a

192
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,100
whole new transformational program that

193
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,800
was continuing you were opening up a new

194
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
outpatient facility uh which has done

195
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,360
tremendous things but did did any of

196
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,940
that stop by necessity or or did you

197
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,460
just have to keep plowing on it no it's

198
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,139
tough for a short period of time I I

199
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,840
think for us it was about six weeks just

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,819
in terms of what we had to do because we

201
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,199
just wanted to make sure sure but no

202
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,060
like healthcare as I say is very

203
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,620
resilient and we're used to crisis

204
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,000
management and you have to see the

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
patients so you know Healthcare doesn't

206
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,919
stop it's a 24 7 365 you know industry

207
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,020
it's demand driven you know you don't

208
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,699
know what's coming through your door 70

209
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,740
of our activity comes through our Ed

210
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,319
Department you know so that just gives

211
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,479
you you can't always predict things but

212
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,340
you can't stop by yourself we were not

213
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,780
one of the lucky ones there were other

214
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,639
agencies absolutely that were affected I

215
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,680
had to put plans in place but luckily

216
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,840
between the the measures we had in place

217
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,759
and working with our partners we were

218
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,139
able to just have to pause for a short

219
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,840
period of time and continue unseen we

220
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,220
didn't cancel our outpatients we didn't

221
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,500
cancel our inpatients we but we were

222
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,340
lucky

223
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,380
um and and I suppose what it's about is

224
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,060
we're only as strong as the weakest link

225
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,860
and it's about bringing everybody up to

226
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,360
the same level so that we can all work

227
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
collaboratively and we can all protect

228
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,060
each other

229
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,220
um and the point of targeting hospitals

230
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
as we've been discussing is that it is

231
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,580
that that critical point in

232
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,039
infrastructure that our Hospital look

233
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,919
after the most sick in society

234
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,680
um and the idea that you can put fear

235
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
into the whole Community by just

236
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,340
conducting an act is hopefully what's

237
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,979
going to Spur people to pay you but what

238
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,720
was interesting is that like everything

239
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,000
else when crisis has happened

240
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,979
um it's the response of the people that

241
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,020
is far more important from a medical

242
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,000
perspective from the staff and the

243
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,440
patients uh

244
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,240
like what happened on those days was the

245
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,380
equivalent of what happened in Wexford

246
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,539
where everybody put their hand to the

247
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,639
tiller and did their very best to ensure

248
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,819
that nobody suffered as a result yeah

249
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,780
it was one of the good things about

250
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,099
working in hospital is that you actually

251
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,319
have beds so on these occasions it's

252
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,819
actually your I.T team that need the

253
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,000
beds and some of the other

254
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,379
staffers on pizza for them because a lot

255
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,500
more

256
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,560
um yeah so it is that that piece of what

257
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,620
needs to be done to to a for me it was

258
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,700
to

259
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,860
give the IT team exactly what they

260
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,260
needed whether it was pizzas our beds

261
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,940
our taxis or whatever else to keep them

262
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,679
doing the bit that they could do because

263
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,540
I am not techy at all I have a clinical

264
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,760
background and and then it's the

265
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,500
operational piece then of what

266
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,120
workarounds do we need to put in place

267
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,640
to keep everything going and I suppose

268
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,140
to bring it back to one of your 80 and

269
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,180
80s analogies I'm old enough to remember

270
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,980
the aces when we actually did all the

271
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,260
clinical work without any I.T yeah we

272
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,720
didn't even have PCS so I suppose in

273
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,160
some ways and because we're a relatively

274
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,920
small hospital so we we would very much

275
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
know each other in all the other teams

276
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
so we wouldn't just be linked

277
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,779
electronically with each other we were

278
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,519
able to put in

279
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,800
um work rounds for almost everything now

280
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,320
that's not to say that things didn't get

281
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,839
slowed down or were not ideal at all but

282
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,820
you know Radiology particularly comes to

283
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,240
mind you couldn't see X-rays at the PCS

284
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,860
around departments so doctors couldn't

285
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,600
see them and couldn't

286
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,560
um you know they didn't have the

287
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,940
technology that they would normally have

288
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,800
that was a big risk the doctors actually

289
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,260
had to come to the x-ray department and

290
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,760
view it on the machine so that'll be

291
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,959
like I suppose like a photographer

292
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,700
trying to look at it on on his screen

293
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,040
there and not be able to manipulate the

294
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,140
the image and do that but it slowed

295
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,279
everything down it slowed everything

296
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,740
down have you changed your protocols now

297
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,300
though because we we know what a

298
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,399
desperate crisis looks like have you put

299
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,560
in different protocols now should God

300
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,019
forbid there'll be a power course or our

301
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,240
cervicals on fire or something happens

302
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,459
that cripples your ID do you now have a

303
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,399
different protocol in place than you had

304
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,500
for business continuity yes and I

305
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,180
suppose before that it would have been

306
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,740
things like

307
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,540
um you know pandemic outbreaks those

308
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,160
were the kind of exercises that we did

309
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,440
even prior to covet but now they are

310
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
more about the operational electronical

311
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,140
electronic workings of the hospital now

312
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,420
there's not a lot you can do in in

313
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,459
having a backup plan for you know you

314
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,420
can back up your data and everything

315
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,279
obviously but in terms of the operation

316
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
of the hospital we would still have to

317
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,060
go back refer to that that the doctors

318
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,279
will have to come to the x-ray machine

319
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,260
to look at the there is no other way

320
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,720
around that yeah it's funny Ronan when

321
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,980
we talk about uh hospitals uh the the

322
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,660
voluntary hospitals yeah the Vincents

323
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,959
and the at the Mercy hospital and others

324
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,700
um were kind of well I think Vincent may

325
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,839
have been infected but the Mercy

326
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,800
Hospital in Cork definitely wasn't

327
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,540
because it was a voluntary hospital and

328
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,920
you know they carried on as best they

329
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,720
could slumbled impact but then of course

330
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,040
happens a few months later which didn't

331
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
get as much coverage was the Mercy

332
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,920
Hospital was subject to a separate

333
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,260
targeted individual attack that took all

334
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,820
of their systems offline they had to

335
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,160
rebuild it from scratch again

336
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
these guys aren't going to stop are they

337
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,820
they're going to just keep targeting

338
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,620
hospitals even though they know that

339
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,000
they are less likely to get paid then

340
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
perhaps they would have been two years

341
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,720
ago when it might have been easier to

342
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,040
pay them to get your data back and move

343
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,800
on yeah look it in my in my opinion look

344
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,779
before I answer that question Jonathan I

345
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,839
think it's important to acknowledge the

346
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,660
the work that the First Responders and

347
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,279
the HSC from an I.T and security

348
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,500
perspective how they how they worked in

349
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,360
that crisis because it was incredible

350
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,980
really I mean they worked I think you

351
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,100
guys worked non-stop 24 hours a day for

352
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,079
literally weeks it was incredible and we

353
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,700
protect a number of hospitals so we saw

354
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,860
it firsthand so what what what those

355
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,660
guys did was astonishing

356
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,680
um

357
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,920
as the FBI showed a moment ago

358
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,000
Healthcare is the number one attacked

359
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Vector globally and there's a number of

360
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,079
reasons for that number one you must

361
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
remember that the world is in a very uh

362
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,760
unstable place geopolitically and if you

363
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
can undermine Health Services in any

364
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
specific country then it undermines

365
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,980
people's fate and the leadership of

366
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,540
their country and what better way to do

367
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,399
that and then Healthcare followed by

368
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,779
maybe Banking and critical

369
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,600
infrastructure and so forth and on top

370
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,420
of that hospitals typically don't have

371
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,820
the types of budget that's required for

372
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,200
either the technology or the people

373
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,920
that's required to harden and protect

374
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,140
very disparate complicated systems and

375
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,760
within those systems you tend to have a

376
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,260
lot of what we call no touch technology

377
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,600
or let's call it no touch Technologies

378
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,640
which are probably x-ray machines or

379
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,620
Radiology machines or whatever it may be

380
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,860
and those systems are updated by large

381
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,720
players like GE globally and in many

382
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,820
cases they run on Legacy software

383
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,060
systems and for our hospitals go and to

384
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,440
segment them successfully within their

385
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,240
Network an air captain and all that good

386
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,220
stuff it's huge investment it's

387
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,820
complicated there's a lack of resources

388
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,440
and and their primary job is to deliver

389
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,480
care in an unbelievably stressful

390
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
environment and you know lots of people

391
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,920
think look we're Healthcare as the guy

392
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,380
said earlier about the the the Pediatric

393
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,300
Hospital in Massachusetts you know are

394
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,620
they really going to attack us and the

395
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,720
answer is yes because it serves a number

396
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
of purposes from destabilization of

397
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
democracies to

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,639
um uh potentially getting ransomware is

399
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,100
paid more so to Private Hospital so

400
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,480
they're going to continue and I think

401
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,220
it's going to probably

402
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,440
um exacerbate over the coming months and

403
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,600
years this was John against that

404
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,160
backdrop look we have a lot of

405
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,560
information that we know about the the

406
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,899
Cyber attack that was impacting the HSE

407
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,420
is random that we haven't heard of at

408
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,560
this budget or even are you still

409
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,120
learning about it at this point as we

410
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,000
move on things that you you have learned

411
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,360
that that are helping you now as you

412
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,760
prepare for the next one uh I think

413
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,380
we're learning from what's Happening

414
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,060
elsewhere and we're learning from what's

415
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,040
happening in our environment because as

416
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,620
I said there are still probes and

417
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,540
attempts to infiltrate the

418
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,760
infrastructure and we're continuously

419
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,019
keeping up to date I think it's not just

420
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,459
what's happening to us but we do have

421
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,899
Partners now that are actually telling

422
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,600
us about new actors you know new

423
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,980
vulnerabilities and we're addressing

424
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,480
that and we're coping that so it is it

425
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,100
is a process of continuous learning and

426
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,139
improving I was just just to the points

427
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,779
that that Rona made about the the the

428
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,139
team I think to put into perspective and

429
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,820
I'd never experienced this before but

430
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,120
but we had the Irish Defense Forces in

431
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
City West

432
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,540
and in terms of beds there was rooms

433
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,360
rented out in the hotel for staff and it

434
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,700
was literally 24 7 operation and people

435
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,620
working around the clock there was

436
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,940
actually paramedics walking around

437
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,560
checking people's vitals at times

438
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,120
because people were working so hard

439
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,699
that's actually the impact of what this

440
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,440
attack had so there was there was a

441
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,660
human impact on the staff and but

442
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,600
obviously on the services as well and I

443
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,820
think you know there'll never be a a

444
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,500
better rationale to to make the

445
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,820
investment to make sure that doesn't

446
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,440
happen again

447
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,260
um but I do think that it is a very the

448
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,420
Cal Care is a very diverse

449
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,459
technology stage

450
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,920
um we and and you need that in terms of

451
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,440
new Innovations because you know there's

452
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,199
things like robotic surgery capabilities

453
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,620
there's new wearables and so we have to

454
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,199
balance you know adapting these new

455
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,360
technologies to improve outcomes while

456
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,519
also protecting the environment but it's

457
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,920
not always the vulnerability you you

458
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
didn't put the vulnerability perhaps in

459
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,060
the software the vulnerability may exist

460
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,279
that's being exploited by these hackers

461
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,779
you're unaware but you didn't buy this

462
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,399
software knowing hey there's got to be

463
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,980
some bit of code in this Windows update

464
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,360
that's going to get let somebody come in

465
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,360
so you know it's it must be engaging the

466
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,519
third parties to kind of when when an

467
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,720
alert comes through from the likes of

468
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,100
Ronan and the team and smart attack or

469
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,240
somebody as part of the vulnerability

470
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,100
like how quickly are you acting on that

471
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,420
now how quickly you're getting that

472
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,279
message out going this is an issue it's

473
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,500
not our fault we didn't do it but we

474
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,600
need to fix it yeah and like the

475
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,339
operation we have in place we we see

476
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,199
teams so we we have continuous

477
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,779
monitoring place on on the end point in

478
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,060
the environment and when people do click

479
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,800
on links there are no vulnerabilities

480
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,720
even in the Estates because we do still

481
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,820
have Legacy technology but actually the

482
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,860
difference now is we see it

483
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,260
it's one of those 46 000 alerts that may

484
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,779
turn into one of those 1200 priority

485
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,459
alerts we may turn into one of those

486
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,260
actions and those actions include

487
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,579
completely containing that environment

488
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,100
stop it connecting to the network shut

489
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,899
it down and then taking action well

490
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,639
you've created an army you've created an

491
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,160
army of people who are watching for risk

492
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
and are identifying it and escalating

493
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,699
which is something that perhaps other

494
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:36,899
organizations would actually be quite

495
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,820
envious of although you'd prefer not to

496
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,019
have created the Army in the first place

497
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,339
I'm guessing well I think I think

498
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,860
everybody in the Army everybody needs

499
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,339
and is it an army A team right and the

500
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,259
team has to match the size and scale of

501
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,720
your organization and this is actually

502
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,399
part of operating in the digital world

503
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,500
you need it and if you don't have it you

504
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,199
you need it David you look at this in a

505
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,940
holistic way I know because you've got

506
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,320
so many systems

507
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,940
um you have so many like you you're

508
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,819
going to work every day saying how am I

509
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,380
going to keep everything London how am I

510
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,939
going to make sure that clinicians have

511
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,020
everything they need that the patient

512
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,099
now comes throughout they're going to be

513
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,020
it's kind of a stressful job to to be

514
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,339
fair to you

515
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,099
um you know what happened you know the

516
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,119
patches and the fixes and everything

517
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,160
that's come in what haven't we done yet

518
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,419
that you would like to see done

519
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,059
that's a huge question because as I said

520
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,620
earlier the attack vectors are changing

521
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,120
so much

522
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,860
um I I like everything I think there's

523
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,380
room for continuous Improvement

524
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,660
um I do think you know and and John has

525
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,919
touched it there is definitely

526
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,440
additional investment needed as again as

527
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,000
I said here we're only as strong as our

528
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,600
weakest link so you know if you look at

529
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,919
Healthcare like only an is directive or

530
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,360
designated as an OES operator of

531
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,220
essential services so there are

532
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,140
definitely areas for investment so we

533
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,020
certainly need our government and and uh

534
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,480
your agency and department has need to

535
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,220
continue that investment to ensure that

536
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,280
we continued strengthen the defenses

537
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,440
um ongoing education we've touched on

538
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
people we have to get the balance there

539
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
right between alerts of what we call

540
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
something that's well known in the

541
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
healthcare is called alert fatigue where

542
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,020
people get so many alerts about

543
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,360
different things that that they tend to

544
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,740
turn off

545
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,780
um the no blame culture you know open

546
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,000
disclosure so that when something does

547
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,400
happen people feel you know power that

548
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,260
they can come forward there are things I

549
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,120
think we have to continue working on all

550
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,480
the time that should become BAU and the

551
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,820
investment should become BAU business as

552
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,340
usual so that you know we're we're at

553
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,799
we're at a point that uh you know we

554
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,440
feel we we've done as much as we can the

555
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,480
the point then is when you're you're hit

556
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,760
with attack and and touching it earlier

557
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,140
like hospitals are used to having a

558
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,760
major emergency and major instant plans

559
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,740
so that whether it's a power cut or

560
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,280
whether it's a gas leak or

561
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,840
plant fire in your Cloud fire like like

562
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,880
that another nightmare that you hadn't

563
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,220
had previously would have now a bit like

564
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,679
you practice I take more practice around

565
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,419
and it's been said earlier about

566
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,580
tabletop exercises and more more

567
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,380
practice around

568
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,260
um actual exercises and then improving

569
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,480
the coordination between the agencies

570
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,940
you know a lot of people take it

571
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,440
straightforward is the HSE but you touch

572
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
on there you've got the HSE you've got

573
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
voluntary agencies you've got

574
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,559
um you know you've got suppliers you

575
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,780
you've got Academia like a lot of

576
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,400
hospitals are linked to Academia and we

577
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,500
see Academia is also wanted to Target

578
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,419
groups so we need to create that

579
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,820
ecosystem and collaboration so a bit

580
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,860
like you know our federal speaker spoke

581
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,480
right here that we're we're sharing that

582
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,700
collaboration and thankfully we have the

583
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,740
ncsc and we have our cert alerts and

584
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,179
other things but there's definitely more

585
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,860
that can be done and there's good

586
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,200
practice in might be the good practice

587
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,880
let's say in two-year hospitals that

588
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,500
should benefit other hospitals John and

589
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,000
that's the great thing about Irish

590
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,320
hospitals they do operate in little

591
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,059
silos that sometimes you want to drag

592
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,039
them out and point out but that's for a

593
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,780
different day and if I can come back to

594
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,660
you um just for a moment uh we're great

595
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,760
at producing reports in this country

596
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,740
um the road to hell is paved

597
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,539
um with reports on what happened into

598
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,919
the Cyber attack

599
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,660
are there elements of that the Jews

600
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,539
still would like to see more donut

601
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,640
oh yeah I mean I think the the

602
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,940
investment as as both John and uh David

603
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,980
have alluded to that that needs to come

604
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,160
and be ongoing because you're dealing

605
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,520
with so much Legacy systems and um the

606
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,039
interconnectivity between us and for us

607
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,660
it's primarily to Saint Vincent's

608
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,100
hospital but then in obviously into the

609
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,140
national system and

610
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,900
um so so that that is the key piece that

611
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,580
all of that upgrading a certain amount

612
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,679
of investment came obviously in at sort

613
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,480
of the critical time

614
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,220
um but ongoing

615
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,780
um there hasn't been you know this

616
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,480
year's budget there's nothing is that

617
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,940
that a waste an opportunity because yeah

618
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm gonna ask Ronan a second about when

619
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,580
this is going to happen again next and

620
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,539
he's going to tell me it's happening

621
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,760
right now yeah uh there's no point in

622
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,260
turning around after this because we

623
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,000
were warned we saw what happened we saw

624
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,380
the disruption we saw the impact on

625
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,720
patients clinicians Hospital Systems we

626
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,520
know the risk but we're not investing

627
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,360
enough

628
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,160
exactly okay

629
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,520
um Ronan on that point uh kind of deja

630
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,780
vu sends the version John I'll come back

631
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,280
to you on that as well it's kind of a

632
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,440
sense of deja vu that my one of my

633
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,660
favorite things is uh those that fail to

634
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,299
remember history never learn from it

635
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,799
we're kind of in that space aren't we

636
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,900
yeah look it's um

637
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,380
I I feel right now in terms of cyber

638
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,919
it's probably the the scale of attacks

639
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,659
are more aggressive than we've ever seen

640
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,880
them before so you obviously hear about

641
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,520
the MTU hacks and the Virgin hacks and

642
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,380
so forth because they're kind of in the

643
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,179
media but they're hard to hide they're

644
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,580
hard to hide exactly spot on uh blow the

645
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,799
surface I mean this does hundreds of

646
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
days happening it was 500 ransomware

647
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,880
attacks in France in the last month for

648
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,860
example you're getting more high profile

649
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,480
vulnerabilities with you know products

650
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,820
like VMware and esxi and Legacy

651
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,500
technologies that are presenting

652
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,539
challenges so this is a this isn't a

653
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,340
one-off solution it's a continuous

654
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,820
problem as far as Healthcare is it goes

655
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,860
um as the guys from the FBI showed it's

656
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,299
the number one attack Vector for the

657
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,280
reasons we've spoken about

658
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,919
um and I in my mind as the streaky areas

659
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
there's obviously the implementation of

660
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,900
the 24 7 monitoring and so forth

661
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,880
um and John's done a good job you know

662
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,679
alluding to how they're getting better

663
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,100
at doing that the secondary area is the

664
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,840
ort side of the house which is again a

665
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,280
little bit more complicated because a

666
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
lot of that technology is no touch but

667
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
because companies like force code and so

668
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,500
forth that are here today that are

669
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,880
bringing technology to the table that

670
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,679
helps that area and then the third one

671
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,059
and probably the biggest one for the day

672
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,799
I would say for the HSC right now is the

673
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,200
data the data is the price for these

674
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,940
guys at the end of the day I would say

675
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,679
probably half of the hospitals in

676
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,220
Ireland are running Excel spreadsheets

677
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,980
um and that presents significant risk

678
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,840
from a regulatory perspective from a

679
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,059
liability can I just interrupt it there

680
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,140
for a second

681
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,539
are we heading to a point where by our

682
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,880
personal data we'll have less value

683
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
because you know every the 86 000

684
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
letters or how many John I can't

685
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,780
remember how many letters sent out uh to

686
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,120
people who are saying your information

687
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,460
was leaked from the vaccination list and

688
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,440
the people who robbed it have X-Men I

689
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,720
mean yeah it's actually not worth

690
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,260
anything well if you've HIV

691
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,200
yeah and your your diagnosis of as being

692
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,059
a HIV patient is the vulnerability

693
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,740
they're looking for is it exactly so I

694
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,840
mean it's all contextual if you

695
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,580
understand the contextual value of data

696
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,380
there's a certain

697
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,000
um risk associated with that if it's

698
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,140
your name and your address and your

699
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,600
email you know big whoopty do right but

700
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,340
if it's something much more sensitive

701
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,020
then you have to ask the question of

702
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,940
what happens if it gets stolen or you

703
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,620
know who's got access to it or you know

704
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,419
Anthony from get visibility spoke very

705
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,460
eloquently about it earlier it's the

706
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,260
value associated with data and the type

707
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,880
of controls that are put around that in

708
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,919
an organization John just last word on

709
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,720
you on on the funding I mean I'm

710
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,100
presuming you're pushing you're pushing

711
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,080
that stone up that hill aren't you yeah

712
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,880
um do you have a concern that we're

713
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,080
still at risk because we're not

714
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,659
investing enough uh I have a concern

715
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,880
where we're at risk I think we're a

716
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,299
harder Target was

717
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,679
we are not you can never say you will

718
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,720
never be breached again what we have is

719
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,760
better containment but we have a lot of

720
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,400
Legacy and the real investment we did

721
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,980
put forward an investment case um you

722
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,539
know if you if you Google I won't get

723
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,460
the number but it was a substantial ask

724
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,460
to government over seven years and we

725
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,159
got a proportionate for year one and we

726
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,720
are continuing to invest and what we're

727
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,299
trying to do is is focus on Legacy as

728
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,880
well as as well still running Windows 7

729
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,799
are they all gone at this point Windows

730
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,179
7 is still in the environment and the

731
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,380
reason it's in the environment because

732
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,020
there are certain critical medical

733
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,059
systems that require Windows 7 but we

734
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,919
are addressing it

735
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,179
um it's a long road Lads I wouldn't

736
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,280
fancy any of your jobs Grant I wouldn't

737
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,320
fancy get their jobs of anyone else here

738
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,179
look a huge appreciation for coming

739
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,120
today David wall Ann Coleman Ronan

740
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,559
Murphy and John Ward will either go that

741
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,520
way

742
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
