2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,960
um I've also asked to deliver a

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,679
controversial speech today

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,179
I promise to deliver

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,400
since it's early in the morning let's

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,880
make a small wake-up test who believes

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,880
that housekeeping is good for cyber

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,039
security

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,920
one two three good

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,960
I can confirm this and I think when

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,059
you're doing housekeeping you know what

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,219
you have to clean up you know what you

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,379
find in your garage in your rooms and

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,600
everything and only when you know what's

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,660
in your house you know what you have to

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,000
clean to protect so it's transparency

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,719
and what I also liked on raluca's speech

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,239
it's it's a kind of organized approach

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,000
and this is when I see the picture how

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,620
they are organized and they are not

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,079
wearing hoodies and looking let's say

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,359
like youngsters it's a military

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,060
discipline behind and this is when

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,400
you're cleaning up your house you're

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,619
somehow disciplined you're organized you

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,240
know what you're talking about and

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,820
that's very important in security so

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,880
this guy here is hungry and he will not

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,619
catch you because you're organized and

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,960
you know what you're talking about and

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,799
you know on my title being the second

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,960
slowest gazelle we are in the food

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,360
service we're a B2B we're selling bread

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,299
we're back bread

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,820
if we would get attacked you would feel

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,939
it because you go to the bakery there is

37
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,060
nothing so you would become hungry and

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,119
this is why we have to try to do a good

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,159
job inside the security constantly

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,340
baking bread to feed you

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,899
um

42
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,220
you notice kind of analogy of the of the

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,979
gazelle and the lion I learned from

44
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,159
another diesel that when you look on the

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
picture of cyber security there is a

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,380
lion there are a couple of gazelles and

47
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,640
normally you would think like you have

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,680
to be the quickest gazelle to be

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,379
protected by the lion because if you're

50
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,020
the quickest one you will never get

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,360
catched

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,940
then he told me no correct it you have

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,480
to be the second slowest one so if

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,340
you're using this one you don't have to

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,800
master it but you just have to be the

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,260
second slowest one and I got a couple of

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,840
years before I got a study from McKinsey

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,540
who said yeah when you're following this

59
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,180
approach your mole has taken your coins

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,140
on on a very efficient way on security

61
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,300
so you're not overspending you're not

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,480
overdoing it so just try to be the

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,360
second slowest gazelle that's much more

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,940
cost efficient and the CFO was clapping

65
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,160
the hand and said yeah luckily now I

66
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,140
have a good reason to reduce the cyber

67
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,239
security budget because I think we're

68
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,519
overdoing it

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,340
um and this is where I said like is it

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,739
really smart to be the second slowest

71
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,280
gazelle now some of the thoughts which I

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,159
I attached to this is

73
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,159
when you use this analogy you are have

74
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,040
to ask yourself who is the lion

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,800
the problem in cyber security is you

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,840
don't know the attacker

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,819
even when you are attacked you don't

78
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,800
know who really attacked you

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
and as we learned from raluca it's not a

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
teenager in a hoodie it's an

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
organization which is more or spread

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
over continents uh probably even

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
globally so how can you more or less

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,340
rate yourself you're the second slowest

85
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,099
gazelle when you don't know the lion

86
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,200
it's guesswork

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,540
the other thought was

88
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,000
if you are in the belief to be the

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,739
second slowest gazelle who is the

90
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,540
slowest

91
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,019
so also there it's guess working when

92
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,640
you don't know who is the slowest you

93
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,500
don't know what the slowest is doing and

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,239
you cannot differentiate and say because

95
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,280
of this reason I'm not the slowest

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,700
gazelle so that's also quite fuzzy quite

97
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
blurry and it doesn't help you to really

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,660
position yourself

99
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,660
is it good enough to be let's say the

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,780
second slowest if you don't know who is

101
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,639
the slowest if you don't know who is the

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,780
lion who is attacking you so hmm it's

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,820
also guessworking so also there it

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,139
didn't work out

105
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,300
do we have enough funds to be quick

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,820
enough

107
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,680
to review the the strategy if you're

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,900
believing it's cyber security is about

109
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,199
saving money then I can only recommend

110
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,360
that you more or less just calculate or

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,820
ask your insurance guy of the company

112
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,220
and uh for sure most of you have

113
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,800
somebody who who works with insurances

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,479
of the company ask him

115
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,940
how much is it worth when the company

116
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,940
would stand for an entire day normally

117
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,680
the guys have this number because they

118
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,080
have to more or less report it to the

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,960
insurance because this is driving the

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,300
the how expensive the insurance for the

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,060
company is so these numbers how much is

122
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,220
a day of complete outage of a company

123
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,340
are available surprisingly the ID guys

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,800
the security guys don't work with this

125
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,660
number and they have no glue

126
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,880
this number will help you to understand

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
how much you can spend on cyber security

128
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,080
because this number a complete outed

129
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,560
outage of a day is so high that you

130
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,539
probably can triple your cyber security

131
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,240
budget and you're still cheap

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
but if you are treated like the rest of

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
it as a cost Factor you're always losing

134
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,400
the game

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
what kind of tools are on the market to

136
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,520
protect us that's also something and

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,500
this is why I ask you who's Believing on

138
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,900
housekeeping if you believe this is a

139
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,699
tool game

140
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,699
um I'm happy to destroy this

141
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,580
by just buying tools and hoping that the

142
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,400
tool is solving your issue this is wrong

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,180
because it's not like you have a

144
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,100
technical attack and you can protect

145
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,440
yourself technically of course you can

146
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,740
do so it's like you have a hoe at home a

147
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,319
door with a lock and you need a key

148
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,780
having a door is a good thing having a

149
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,060
lock is also good but at the end if you

150
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,039
leave the door open

151
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,020
the key and the door and everything is

152
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,300
useless so it's at the end the people

153
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,880
business it's how your people in the

154
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
organization work how your cyber

155
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,800
security how your I.T team is working so

156
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,840
it's a people business it's not a tool

157
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,880
business it's not solving your issue

158
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,620
when you just buy tools and tools and

159
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,520
tools

160
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,780
yeah

161
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,300
and these are just some thoughts which I

162
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,180
I took behind the analogy and I thought

163
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,699
like my target as a tea so it's very

164
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,460
simple I don't want to be eaten by an

165
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,520
attacker I want to sleep well I'm a very

166
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,639
simple basic man and I'm counting on my

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,860
sleep because this drives me every

168
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,500
morning awake to the office so I thought

169
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,319
like if I want to sleep well what kind

170
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,240
of message do I have to teach my people

171
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
because my people are responsible that

172
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm sleeping well the first thing is

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,940
when I looked on our organization user

174
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,460
awareness is low we didn't do really

175
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,560
training when you talk to the people

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,080
about cyber security everybody got it

177
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,780
from the news but there was nothing else

178
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,539
so there was no understanding what do I

179
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,539
have to do what do I as a user have to

180
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,319
contribute to keep the company safer and

181
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,419
the most horrible example was that I had

182
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,819
the impression that the people felt like

183
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,300
it's an I.T issue so it has to more or

184
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,280
less solve the issue and it's not up to

185
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,539
me

186
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,599
and there is this joke where we say it

187
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,580
can be so wonderful without the user

188
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,380
from a cyber security point of view I

189
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,840
can only confirm it if I want to be safe

190
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,599
I exclude the user from the system and I

191
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,539
can sleep well so one thing is that we

192
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,120
have to understand that at the end we

193
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,280
have a lot of users working with the

194
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,740
systems doing crazy things on what we

195
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,120
are providing them

196
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,819
and they have to be aware that they are

197
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,180
important in respect of cyber security

198
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,280
it sounds really basic and I know there

199
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,259
are a lot of Articles and speeches and

200
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,680
then but when there is so much around on

201
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,779
on information on the topic user

202
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,299
awareness I'm still asking myself what

203
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,279
went wrong in our company because these

204
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,860
guys have to believe it's an I.T issue

205
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,099
yeah the next topic is

206
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,680
do we act like a procurement so when I'm

207
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,720
coming with ah we need to do this and

208
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
this and this I'm getting like oh it's

209
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,920
too expensive we have to negotiate the

210
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,100
rule can we do it cheaper and instead of

211
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,080
getting something where we have to

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,580
believe that it's really moving us

213
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,560
forward it has to be cheap

214
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,320
and the discount is important and that's

215
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,839
also strange because again if you would

216
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,000
have an outage the discount would be

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,640
gone immediately and we would more or

218
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,740
less erase the flag and said what is it

219
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,240
the right decision was it the right

220
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,339
direction to just say oh it's cost

221
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,600
efficient

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,640
do we have transparency back to the

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,700
housekeeping if you have a house and you

224
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380
don't know how many doors you have you

225
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,060
don't know how many keys you should have

226
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,220
so you're sitting in front of your five

227
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,740
Keys you don't know how many doors you

228
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,839
have how many locks are in these doors

229
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,380
and you feel protected I wouldn't so

230
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,660
transparency it sounds really strange

231
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,940
but transparency is for me a key element

232
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,980
if you don't know what's standing around

233
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,440
in your organization you have no clue

234
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,300
what you have to protect so everything

235
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,880
what you're doing is guess working

236
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,120
and it's really something very basic

237
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,100
then the other thing is we are not

238
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,240
consequent

239
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,580
and probably you're doing hopefully a

240
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,500
little bit better but a red star I would

241
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,360
say is the company of the half finished

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,700
projects now when you do half printish

243
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,560
projects it's like you construct the

244
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,019
house and you have probably some doors

245
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,640
but you more or less stopped

246
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,040
implementing windows so you have a door

247
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,620
with a lock but you have a window which

248
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,959
is just an invitation for a cyber

249
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,420
attacker so be consequent in what you're

250
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,060
doing finish it and I know the last 10

251
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,120
meters to finish a task are the most

252
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
stressful and the most painful and quite

253
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
often people lose interest because it

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,500
was already such a stress but the last

255
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,300
10 meters in respect of cyber security

256
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,279
are the crucial one because you finish

257
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,860
your job and then you know it's really

258
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,600
done

259
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,640
um have a strategy and the strategy

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
doesn't mean that you have to have a a

261
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,140
huge meeting and design something

262
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,180
complex the strategy is that you have to

263
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,519
have a Target where you start working

264
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,200
against it and when you reach the target

265
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
you just continue and you do it every

266
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,940
year you're setting a three years Target

267
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,940
what kind of state is do you want to

268
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,019
reach

269
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,380
and surprisingly in cyber security I see

270
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,420
quite often that we are buying tools but

271
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,399
we have no strategy and then we have

272
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,100
more or less conflicting situations we

273
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,660
are discussing at the moment how many

274
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,060
firewalls do we really need and we have

275
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,120
some parts of the organization saying as

276
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,240
much firewalls as we can get of course

277
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,060
other people say be pragmatic I'm more

278
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,620
on the pragmatics thing because of

279
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,140
complexity management as more components

280
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,600
you take in as more complex you are and

281
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,180
as harder is to fix issues so this is

282
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,459
this is a really tough decision a

283
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,100
discussion but if you don't have a strat

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,860
strategic Target against what do you

285
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,680
measure all your actions and all your

286
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,200
projects and activities

287
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,040
another topic is no feedback culture now

288
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,620
a simple topic is the pushing button

289
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,959
there are so many Tools around and

290
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,300
buttons around where you can more or

291
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,399
less press and say oh this is a pushing

292
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,399
mail and then it disappears perfect it

293
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,320
disappears in the black hole and the

294
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,600
user presses this because he heard yeah

295
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
you're supposed to press it so the first

296
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,220
10 times he's pressing it he's getting

297
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,779
no feedback and then he's losing

298
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:16,560
interest

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,660
so your entire pitching campaign model

300
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,339
has went down the drain because the

301
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,640
people lost interest now if you tell him

302
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,500
more or less after he pressed thanks for

303
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,360
pressing the pushing button we come back

304
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,360
with an analysis and then he's getting a

305
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,420
feedback telling him hey this was a

306
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,779
marketing campaign not dangerous or he's

307
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,640
getting something thanks that you press

308
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
the button this was a pitching attack

309
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,500
well done well recognized create a

310
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,180
feedback culture to keep the people

311
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,740
motivated

312
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,720
when you're going home and you're saying

313
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,779
nothing to your wife you will get the

314
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,820
res the the receipt

315
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,940
after a certain couple of months if

316
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,680
you're going every day home and you give

317
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,720
feedback hey you're pretty I like you

318
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,620
you're getting a nice dinner you get a a

319
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,120
a a a good feedback so give feedback you

320
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,519
do it in private why in hell do we don't

321
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,260
use the same principle in the company

322
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,540
and we give the people feedback to keep

323
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,279
them motivated on the marathon of being

324
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,440
sensitive to cyber security

325
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,920
and it's the same as if you do not do

326
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,720
housekeeping at home you're at the end

327
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,639
of messy and you cannot enter your home

328
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,980
because there are so much rubbish and

329
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,480
waste in the home that you cannot open

330
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,800
the door so

331
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,260
just apply what works at home also the

332
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,120
company and

333
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,639
use a comfort is something which I'm

334
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,680
also quite often hearing we shouldn't do

335
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,899
these activities because we are

336
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,180
destroying the user Comfort forget it

337
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,779
security is nothing about comfort

338
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,019
but it's a fine line think about your

339
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,220
key

340
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,100
I mean in a good old days the key was

341
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,360
big

342
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,760
and heavy and nowadays you have a

343
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,079
fingertip

344
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,260
so think about how you can make cyber

345
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,060
security

346
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,700
comfortable for the user because as long

347
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,040
as it's comfortable he's accepting it

348
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,040
nobody goes at work to go around

349
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,980
something when it's comfortable

350
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,440
people go around your measures when

351
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,200
they're uncomfortable so always bear in

352
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,540
mind Implement security measures in such

353
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,600
a way that it's comfortable for them

354
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,300
because then he will not walk away and

355
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,339
try to bypass them

356
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,199
it's so simple yeah it's so simple

357
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,800
good so our way forward

358
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,320
okay formatting didn't didn't work

359
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,699
properly

360
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,339
housekeeping cmdb is a must and that's

361
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,959
not for discussion

362
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,120
internally for me this is really a

363
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,279
principle it's not for discussion if you

364
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,560
have a cmdb you know what you have to

365
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,660
protect and it has to be accurate and up

366
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,459
to date and then you can more or less

367
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,980
start clustering placing your message

368
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,000
and like military service you go ahead

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,480
identify consequently the user

370
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,040
multi-factor

371
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,160
authentication development holistic

372
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,019
strategy increase awareness these are

373
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,880
all measures which are so damned

374
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
important and you see on this list

375
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,660
nothing complicated it's really simple

376
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,480
pragmatic it's straightforward but it

377
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,240
helps you to increase the maturity make

378
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,899
security tangible and and explainable to

379
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,040
the people

380
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,880
so I would say for me the analogy is not

381
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,279
being the second slowest gazelle I try

382
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,100
to be an ugly Target and like raluca

383
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
correctly said it's just a matter when

384
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,899
you will be attacked but it's crystal

385
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,000
clear that you will be attacked sooner

386
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,540
than later so instead of saying I try to

387
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,699
really prevent that I'm attacked I try

388
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,540
to be an ugly Target so you either he's

389
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,060
successful but then I have to have the

390
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,699
capability to handle the attack properly

391
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,300
and quickly to minimize the impact or

392
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,339
the attacker pulls back because you

393
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:12,779
figured out like oh that's too

394
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,880
complicated there are easier victims on

395
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,959
the market

396
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,300
and this is why for me the analogy is

397
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,519
more like being an ugly Target instead

398
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,139
of the second slowest gazelle because

399
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,300
it's much more tangible and I can work

400
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,300
much stronger with it with it

401
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,959
um

402
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,600
in a summary

403
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,320
um

404
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,920
on how do we become a difficult Target

405
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,959
transparency being really specific no

406
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,019
blurry discussions being proactive so

407
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,759
instead of waiting that we have an

408
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,800
incident and then we're doing learning

409
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,959
sessions we are trying to more or less

410
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,500
learn by having a segregation of Duty we

411
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,620
have a security officer he is supposed

412
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,680
to be ugly and and difficult and and

413
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,899
challenging us on a daily basis and we

414
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,180
have to accept this because otherwise

415
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,800
we're looking in our mirror saying wow

416
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,220
we are the most beautiful one and

417
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,959
it's not true

418
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,900
being holistic you cannot just isolate

419
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,640
the topic at the end you have to more or

420
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,740
less see it holistically if you want to

421
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,980
uh uh create appropriate measures

422
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,619
feedback oriented and this is going

423
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,540
across all levels in the organization

424
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,520
from the user to the board of directors

425
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,760
and level conform a user needs to be

426
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,199
differently approached than a board

427
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,540
member

428
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,120
and if you attack a board member with

429
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,400
technical specifications you will not

430
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,320
get a second chance to talk about cyber

431
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,059
security board session

432
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,580
so the challenge is how do you explain a

433
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,940
non-security guy non-technical guy what

434
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,919
you're trying to do and why you want to

435
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,660
have more funds

436
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,700
and that's a challenge but if you manage

437
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,620
this one they're becoming your best

438
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,260
friends and you're really creating some

439
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,600
progress in cyber security it took us

440
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,400
one year to do that

441
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,500
that you also have a number as most of

442
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,760
your number

443
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,059
sensitive one year took us in a red star

444
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,820
to change the board impression about

445
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,860
cyber security

446
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,500
cool thanks a lot

447
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,770
