2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,480
a few years ago much of the NCIS

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,280
Workforce went through training designed

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,259
to help our Personnel develop an outward

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,599
mindset focusing on ourselves or

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,279
focusing on others rather than looking

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,380
inward toward ourselves

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,660
one module of that training included

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,760
discussion of the five pillars of Focus

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
used by Navy Seals

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,199
one takeaway from that discussion is to

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,300
rather than focus on the size of the

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,320
task

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,660
focus on the immediate what do you have

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,460
to do right now rather than letting your

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,980
mind wander toward the Horizon and all

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,260
the hard things still to come

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,200
another way of saying this is if you

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,420
ignore the Urgent it will harm you today

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,820
if you ignore the important it will harm

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,960
you tomorrow

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,539
let me say that again if you ignore the

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
Urgent it will harm you today

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,559
if you ignore the important it will harm

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,360
you tomorrow

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,079
is cyber security urgent or important

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,239
I think many of us would agree that it's

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,440
actually both

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,759
urgent and important

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
but there is less agreement on how we

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
should address issues affecting the

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,720
future

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
therefore I want to offer you some

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,140
insights today about how the U.S

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,360
government the Department of Defense the

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,880
department of the Navy and NCIS are

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
approaching the problem to see if they

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,720
as to see if the same approach might

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,259
work for you

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,979
all right

41
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,680
so the first slide was going to be the

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,840
Eisenhower Matrix but there's a time

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,220
management tool you might have heard

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,860
about called the Eisenhower Matrix it

45
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,200
was created by Dwight D Eisenhower he

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,240
was a key U.S army General and Allied

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,640
Commander during World War II then he

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,860
became Supreme Allied Commander of NATO

49
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,000
and was U.S president from 1953 to 1961.

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,460
his decision Matrix which you see which

51
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,079
you would have seen on the screen but I

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,320
I kind of blew it just a square divided

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,600
into four boxes helps us rate urgency

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,060
versus importance and determine how to

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,979
proceed once we've categorized the task

56
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,780
before us

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,700
we can see what's in play which helps us

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,520
analyze and realize that something on

59
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,800
our to-do list might be urgent but not

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,020
important or important but not urgent

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,340
and so on

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,520
we can decide to do delete or delegate

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,739
the tasks on our list

64
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,800
educator businessman author and keynote

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
speaker Stephen Covey also taught about

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
urgent versus important for decades

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,920
perhaps you've read his most popular

68
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
book The Seven Habits of Highly

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,760
Effective People and if so you're

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
probably familiar with the concept of

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,780
urgent and important

72
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,360
I ask again is cyber security urgent or

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,379
important

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,840
if it is indeed both then how do we

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,720
action our data protection objectives

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
the book The Four disciplines of

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,500
execution says there are two principal

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,660
things a leader can influence when it

79
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,000
comes to producing results your strategy

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,099
and your ability to execute that

81
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,420
strategy

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,220
the book explains that the enemy of

83
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,800
execution is the Whirlwind also known as

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,180
our day jobs

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,220
the Whirlwind is that massive amount of

86
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,019
energy necessary to keep operations

87
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,659
going on a day-to-day basis

88
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,940
the Whirlwind is what makes it so hard

89
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,700
for us to execute anything new

90
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,159
it's what causes us to sometimes wonder

91
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,560
at day's end what did I exactly

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,420
accomplish today hopefully you don't

93
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,480
feel that way at the end of today but

94
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,340
the Whirlwind is urgent and our goals

95
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,319
are important but when urgency and

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,140
importance Clash urgency wins every time

97
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,480
in terms of cyber security are you

98
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,280
spending more time on urgent or

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,420
important

100
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,239
one last passage from the book One CEO

101
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,159
is quoted as saying for his organization

102
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,040
the Whirlwind is not like dragons it's

103
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,080
more like gnats

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm not even sure you have nuts in

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,239
Ireland

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,120
I I honestly don't know but they're a

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,560
real problem in the United States in the

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,819
summer time

109
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,620
I know you don't have snakes though

110
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,459
right

111
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,180
for uh due to St Patrick but anyway

112
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,739
gnats are a little tiny flaws that

113
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,239
invariably show up when you when you're

114
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,739
trying to have a picnic they swarm

115
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,180
around your face they try to get into

116
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,739
your eyes and instead of enjoying the

117
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,239
picnic you end up swatting at it the

118
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,738
whole time and saying some pretty

119
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,060
colorful words

120
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,399
in business and cyber security we can

121
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,260
spend so much time swatting at gnats

122
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
then when we look back over the last six

123
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,620
months we see that we haven't

124
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,419
accomplished many of the important steps

125
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,280
we intended to take to make our data

126
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,820
more secure

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
crypto scams threats to two-part

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
authentication man on the side attacks

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
fishing smushing and fishing are all

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
significant issues for our private

131
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,560
organizations businesses and governments

132
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,479
I would suggest that these can be urgent

133
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,400
but I believe other issues are more

134
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,540
important

135
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,360
one emerging concern is that criminals

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
and our adversaries can use AI

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,259
generators and deep deep fakes

138
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,600
maliciously and mislead our populations

139
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
and undermine our personal financial and

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,759
social well-being and harm democracies

141
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,259
in the companies those democracies

142
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,520
support

143
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
threats to the Cyber supply chain due to

144
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,180
fraud criminal subversion or

145
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,759
nation-state activities if not addressed

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
will eventually undermine our ability to

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,860
operate in cyberspace personally

148
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,960
professionally or militarily

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,060
solving these bigger more important

150
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,460
challenges will require more than

151
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,919
changing passwords more often or not

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,020
opening certain text messages although

153
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,639
these steps should also be paid

154
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,900
attention to

155
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,400
make sure you do that

156
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
these significant issues are more than a

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,300
nuisance they can have devastating

158
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,680
consequences

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,780
while your personal security is at risk

160
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,240
from all kinds of scams so is the

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,340
National Security of Ireland the United

162
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,740
States and every other country every

163
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,780
minute of every day

164
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,000
and the consequences of large-scale

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,259
cyber crime could be catastrophic

166
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,060
my name is Chris McMahon I'm the deputy

167
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,740
director of operations for the naval

168

criminal investigative service

169
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,699
headquartered at Quantico Virginia

170
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,800
McMahon a fine Irish name or I was told

171
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,340
last night was McMahon but what can I do

172
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,860
I'm told my ancestors hail from Limerick

173
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,680
but given the number of mcmahonz and

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,900
Ennis and County Clare I feel certain I

175
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,520
have Roots there as well

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
every time I return to Ireland I find it

177
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,940
difficult to understand why any wood

178
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,440
would want to leave this amazing place

179
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,680
but I recognize Toms were different then

180
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
people were not worried about cyber

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,000
security what was urgent and important

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
to them was survival

183
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,380
my time with you today is short if my

184
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
comments prompt questions in your mind I

185
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,620
encourage you to remember them and after

186
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,780
the session find me and my colleague

187
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,240
Luke suthar the head of the NCS cyber

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,860
directorate who is here with me today

189
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,900
we'll meet you in the hallway after the

190
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,180
session where are you luky

191
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,100
that's there is

192
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm lucky to have him on my team perhaps

193
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,819
some of you in the audience were here

194
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,259
last year when Lou geek presented his

195
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,479
Eva concept

196
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,280
anyone

197
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,539
Bueller

198
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,240
Bueller like awesome if the 80s and 90s

199
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,520
movie and TV references kind of get old

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,380
you can tell me that after the session

201
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,600
two I am always willing to learn grow

202
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,699
and evolve

203
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,340
as NCS deputy director of operations I

204
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,440
oversee and strategically guide all

205
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,660
operational activities to include to

206
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,580
include those in cyberspace

207
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,620
before becoming deputy director I led

208
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,840
the NCIS National Security directorate

209
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,240
which as its name implies focuses on

210
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,440
crimes that could affect National

211
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,800
Security

212
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,080
have you seen the NCS TV show

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,280
I work for the real NCIS we're kind of a

214
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,199
little bit like the TV show but most of

215
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
us are not as put together as the

216
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,599
characters on the shows or as famous or

217
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,759
nearly as well paid

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,080
that is not to say that we don't have

219
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,819
some real characters in our organization

220
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,699
we do and I would love to tell you that

221
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,440
my life has been as exciting as any one

222
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
of the seasons of the show or any of the

223
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,080
four shows but it is definitely not it's

224
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,699
had its moments but it's definitely not

225
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,180
been that dramatic thank goodness

226
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,979
um well I while the show's portrayal of

227
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,419
our day-to-day activities is not

228
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,860
completely accurate

229
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,020
the excellent actors who portray my team

230
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,080
do capture their intensity focus and

231
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,740
professionalism

232
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,560
my NCIS team is approximately 2 000

233
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,259
people strong we operate from 190

234
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,780
locations in more than 40 countries

235
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,020
NCS is a small agency with a big mission

236
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,880
the NCIS Mission goals are to prevent

237
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,979
terrorism protect secrets and key

238
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,260
Technologies and to reduce crime

239
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,440
on land at Sea and in cyberspace

240
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,719
we protect and preserve the superiority

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,219
of the Navy and Marine Corps wherever

242
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,480
they may be

243
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,640
to enable them to deter aggression and

244
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
if pressed to win the next fight

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
in terms of cyber security what's our

246
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,140
solution what do we need to focus on to

247
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,720
create the right strategy and how should

248
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,060
we execute those strategies

249
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,640
how does NCIS reduce the threat of

250
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,920
having our data compromised and help

251
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,080
protect the data of our government and

252
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,120
industrial-based partners

253
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,459
what the NCIS Navy and with the U.S Navy

254
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,440
and NCIS have decided to do and what I

255
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,480
would offer to you as a solution to

256
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,459
dealing with your swarms of distractions

257
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,399
is to change mindsets

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
simply put we have moved from a

259
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,660
compliance mindset and have adopted a

260
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,420
Readiness mindset policies and paperwork

261
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,760
and checklists will only take us so far

262
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,980
yes we want to take the boxes and ensure

263
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,240
that we've done the basics but that's

264
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
just the beginning

265
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
the U.S Department of Defense has

266
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,920
enacted a number of directives that are

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,660
driving our Workforce and our policy

268
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,519
makers towards this Readiness mindset

269
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,420
I believe the secretary of the Navy

270
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,640
Carlos Del Toro sums up this shift to a

271
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,500
Readiness mindset best and a recent

272
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,080
directive noting that for too long the

273
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,580
cyber security posture of the Department

274
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,680
of the Navy has been based on a

275
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,660
compliance approach that depends on

276
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,820
checklists and policies to secure our

277
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,019
technology

278
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,480
we have ample evidence over the last 15

279
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,580
plus years that this approach is

280
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,160
ineffective and cumbersome

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,860
better cyber security is not achieved

282
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,980
solely through compliance and

283
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,000
compliance-based approaches are

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,740
insufficient to secure the department of

285
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,820
the Navy

286
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,260
in support of the Department of the

287
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,420
Navy's information superiority Vision

288
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,279
the department of the Navy will

289
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,959
transform its approach

290
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,180
to cyber security by pivoting from a

291
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,040
compliance mindset to a dynamic model

292
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,140
rooted in the philosophy of readiness

293
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,060
now I don't know if you've ever been

294
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,920
punched in the face

295
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,959
I have been probably more times than I

296
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,060
would actually like to admit but so take

297
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,500
it from me when you get punched in the

298
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
face it feels pretty urgent

299
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,399
this is what's happening to us in terms

300
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,040
of cyber security it's not Nats that

301
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,720
we're dealing with we're getting punched

302
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,880
in the nose every single moment of every

303
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,079
single day

304
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,820
traditionally most of us have thought of

305
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,800
security security from a compliance

306
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
mindset or a defensive mindset we have

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,540
put in the boxing headgear and felt

308
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,740
protected

309
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,720
and both government and private sector

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,459
we've developed policies and procedures

311
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,459
based on the threats we knew existed

312
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,260
focusing on complying with these

313
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,240
policies and procedures lands us on the

314
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
hamster wheel of busyness

315
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
running as hard as we can but never

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,220
really getting anywhere

317
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,800
we're so busy filling out TPS reports

318
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,360
and triplicate that we never accomplish

319
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,640
anything of significance

320
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,860
we should be doing what we should be

321
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,200
doing is consistently be an alert for

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
emerging threats and determining how to

323
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,579
address those quickly and effectively

324
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,380
we've all been acting like time is on

325
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,740
our side time is not on our side

326
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,320
that's the urgency of cyber security new

327
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,240
threats are appearing with alarming

328
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,760
frequency practically every day

329
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
if we continue to try and defend

330
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,839
everything we end up overlooking

331
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,720
specific vulnerabilities in our system

332
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,640
we need to start by assessing the

333
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,279
threats effectively to prioritize what

334
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
most needs defending we need to learn

335
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,660
how to speak the same language use the

336
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,940
same cyber security lexicon to ensure

337
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,740
we're speaking with precision

338
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,720
Irish and English are similar but not

339
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,740
identical

340
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,720
certain words phrases have different

341
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
meanings like football and Pitch we can

342
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,399
probably figure out from the context of

343
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,680
our conversations which which what each

344
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,660
other mean but are we talking American

345
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,660
football or european football and to

346
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,760
make it more confusing in the U.S pitch

347
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,620
usually has to do with a completely

348
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,140
different sport baseball

349
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,700
and that is if we are using the same

350
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,079
basic language

351
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,120
to take an anal take the analogy one

352
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,220
step further if you're speaking perfect

353
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,079
Gaelic but I don't have a clue what

354
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
you're saying which is 100 true I have

355
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,519
no idea what you're saying our

356
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,320
conversations about cyber security are

357
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,880
going to be much more difficult and the

358
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,620
likelihood of misunderstanding much

359
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,480
higher

360
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,700
perhaps you are asking yourself is the

361
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,079
deputy director of the naval criminal

362
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,700
investigative service a criminal

363
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,860
investigative organization really

364
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,360
telling us that compliance is not

365
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,560
necessary

366
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,540
that we should break away from policies

367
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,180
and procedures to address cyber security

368
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,760
no I am not

369
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,579
I believe the compliance mindset and any

370
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,800
type of security setting is helpful and

371
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,560
that that it assures a baseline has been

372
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,500
provided but compliance alone is not

373
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,620
enough

374
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,180
in order to build Readiness and address

375
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,019
import the important issues we NCIS have

376
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,880
focused our team and our people on four

377
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,279
operational tenants encouraging

378
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,120
curiosity making intuitive decisions

379
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,040
building trust-based teams and

380
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,420
communicating professionally and

381
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,680
effectively

382
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,019
we must encourage curiosity

383
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,760
that means training your Workforce on

384
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,279
how to find and find answers and the

385
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,320
best information available

386
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,139
we must make intuitive decisions being

387
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,139
indecisive making no decision can cause

388
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,820
great harm

389
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,100
using the best information available our

390
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,959
training and our experiment or our

391
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,560
experience we must make the call to act

392
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,800
we must build teams and trust each other

393
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,839
that concept is pretty self-explanatory

394
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,700
but as we all know it can be easier said

395
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,660
than done

396
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,459
we must work together government and

397
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,260
Industry to proactively defend against

398
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,899
these cyber security threats

399
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,180
finally and perhaps most importantly we

400
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,500
must communicate professionally and

401
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,700
effectively

402
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,260
if there's one issue I've seen

403
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,360
throughout my career cause great risk to

404
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,220
the mission and team it would be

405
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,139
ineffective communication or just no

406
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,040
communication at all

407
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
foreign

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
these tenants are not particularly

409
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,220
technical security is not only about

410
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,459
ones and zeros it's about people

411
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,040
the Bad actors are people the victims

412
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,320
are people the solution is people like

413
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,040
you

414
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,540
who understand the urgency and

415
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,000
importance of cyber security you are the

416
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,940
best tool in the cyber security toolbox

417
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,399
at NCIS we're using the four tenants as

418
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,220
tools to turn our Workforce into Master

419
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,180
crafts persons

420
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,980
with all this in mind we need to look

421
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,440
beyond the Cyber and cyber security to

422
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,360
better incorporate the people physical

423
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,459
and business related issues affecting

424
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,260
our cyber security posture

425
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,120
we must be ready for the punch we know

426
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,399
is coming much as the boxer on the

427
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,040
screen here is poised to defend and

428
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
respond

429
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,740
we cannot operate and defend our

430
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,019
networks at the Baseline anymore then

431
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,820
you can play a game of football what

432
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,320
Americans call soccer

433
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,639
staying on the sideline

434
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,800
our mobile work from anywhere world has

435
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,540
exponentially increased the threat of

436
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,880
our data being compromised we must stay

437
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,100
vigilant and create cultures that Foster

438
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,220
creativity as our teams seek Solutions

439
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,440
we need to compare and contrast known

440
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,480
and Potential Threat vectors with key

441
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,760
intellectual property and important data

442
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,800
to prioritize protection

443
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
we must recognize that a defensive

444
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,160
security posture will not fully address

445
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,880
emerging threats we must do constant and

446
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,699
consistent self-red teaming emulating a

447
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,500
potential enemy's attack or exploitation

448
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,540
capabilities to test our digital fence

449
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,060
lines then communicate findings and

450
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,000
Lessons Learned quickly and broadly to

451
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,560
more holistically address the creative

452
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,360
vulnerabilities

453
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,300
we must be more proactive to anticipate

454
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,740
threat vectors we must connect and

455
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,240
collaborate with our private sector and

456
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,459
government Partners to share the threats

457
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,699
and efforts to stop them more quickly

458
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,040
that is one of the key values of zero

459
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,199
Dacon connection

460
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,420
it facilitates government entities like

461
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,940
NCIS and representatives here from other

462
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,040
government agencies from various nations

463
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,040
in the sharing of Lessons Learned with

464
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,019
private sector entities

465
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,540
so how do we accomplish these things

466
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,180
the first step is to build relationships

467
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,160
perhaps you read in an article in the

468
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,079
business post this past Sunday in which

469
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,660
my colleague Luke suether was talking

470
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,079
about the criticality of building

471
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,399
relationships left of Boom as the

472
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,160
Marines say meaning left of or before a

473
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,720
critical incident like a data breach

474
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,799
occurs

475
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,919
we must build those relationships now

476
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,380
because when a crisis hits we can surge

477
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,079
resources but it's impossible to Surge

478
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,520
undeveloped relationships

479
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,299
so today my call or my challenge for you

480
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,720
all my call to action is this

481
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,760
enable the more proactive Readiness

482
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,799
mindset in your organizations by

483
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,600
encouraging curiosity

484
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,460
deporting quick intuitive decision

485
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,400
making building trust-based teams within

486
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
your organization and with your private

487
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,419
industry and government partners and

488
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,280
encouraging and supporting professional

489
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,500
effective communication with these

490
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,000
trusted partners

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,460
if we connect and work together we will

492
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,140
maintain the ability to defend against

493
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,960
the daily urgent while preparing for the

494
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,419
strategically important

495
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,280
I want to thank zero daycon for inviting

496
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,080
Luke and I to be here with you

497
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
and I thank you for your attention it's

498
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,280
an honor for us to represent the awesome

499
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,500
people of NCIS here today

500
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,480
cyber security requires a team approach

501
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,940
and Lukey and I and NCIS are honored to

502
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,500
be part of your team

503
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,059
I look forward to connection or

504
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,440
connecting with and building lasting

505
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,940
relationships with you

506
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,860
the people responsible for carrying out

507
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,660
this important mission

508
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,160
and the book I mentioned earlier the

509
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,440
four disciplines of execution discipline

510
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,660
number four is create a Cadence of

511
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,179
accountability that is to say unless we

512
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,380
consistently hold one another

513
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,900
accountable our goal of better data

514
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,700
protection will disintegrate into the

515
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,960
Whirlwind

516
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
Stephen Covey said you have to decide

517
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,220
what you want your highest priority to

518
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,500
be have the courage pleasantly smiling

519
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,880
unapologetically to say no to other

520
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
things

521
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,940
and the way to do that is to have a

522
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,799
bigger yes burning inside

523
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
I now encourage you to make that make

524
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
moving to a Readiness mindset a burning

525
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,120
passionate yes

526
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,419
again as I mentioned earlier

527
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,220
if you have questions Luke and I will

528
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,720
see you in the hallway after we conclude

529
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,660
here and and just let me clarify despite

530
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,120
all the boxing imagery and me being in

531
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,980
the blue red corner and Luke being in

532
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,900
the blue Corner we're not calling you

533
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,059
out as we say in the United States to

534
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,100
fight in the hallway over disagreements

535
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,020
or conversations we're just going to be

536
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,460
out there to answer questions

537
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,140
and I'm just saying we're going to be

538
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,460
easy to find

539
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,020
um and then I'll be back here this

540
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,000
afternoon at 2 25 as part of a panel

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,620
discussion called from data to critical

542
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,539
infrastructure improving our defense

543
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,520
against the Invisible Threat so I hope

544
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,640
to see you then thank you

545
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,930
