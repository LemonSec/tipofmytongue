2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,740
good morning everyone so I'm a hacker I

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,480
may not look like a one but that's

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,099
intended you will not expect an attack

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,580
from me

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,660
so I think you all have the same feeling

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,600
so long story short cyber security is

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
better these days I mean we got more

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,279
capabilities better tools more detailed

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,740
thread intelligence so we are safer now

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,120
but are we really

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,160
I have to say it doesn't look direct

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,620
from my side nor from these stats

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,440
despite all those improvements my team

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,480
and unfortunately the bad guys also

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,660
still manage to break in

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,120
today in this session I will hopefully

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,879
show you four examples where we managed

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
to break into monitored and supposedly

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,620
secured environment

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,559
bear with me while I'll explain how we

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,840
managed to do this and most importantly

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,219
why we succeeded

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,060
so quick look at our infrastructure in

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,460
the first place so you got the you will

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,260
understand what the difference is up

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,080
against as you can see there's no single

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,540
source that can be easily detected and

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,960
blocked the infrastructure is complex it

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,840
contains multiple elements the key

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,479
elements of such infrastructure is we

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,340
adopted the devops approach called

33
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,020
infrastructure as a code so we have

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,380
scripts to recreate this infrastructure

35
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,119
from the scratch you can you can take

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,880
this down and we're able to put it back

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,180
within a couple hours or less the

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,460
workload is distributed so you won't see

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,500
a single IP address doing a port scan on

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,840
your environment if you have rules that

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,200
are based on volume and timing they will

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
fail

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,119
burnable components the Red Blocks on

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,579
that diagram are assumed to be detected

45
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,380
and blocked but we don't care those are

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,720
not actual malicious servers those are

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,759
just proxies and they can be easily

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,520
replaced with couple of seconds and last

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,099
thing switchblade is a concept developed

50
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,640
by NSA to put it in a simple words if

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,379
you will find something that you think

52
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,920
is a malware server hacker server and

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,319
you visit it you will be directed to a

54
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,819
normal web page

55
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,200
because you don't know how to

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,060
communicate with it in order to see

57
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,739
what's actually behind you got to know

58
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,080
how to communicate with that with that

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,040
switchblade server

60
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,800
so in the first example we were tasked

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,599
with a red teaming assessment our goal

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,780
was to access the internal Network and

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,660
gain highest possible privileges our

64
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,340
victim was a prestigious International

65
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,860
College uh sorry prestigious

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,840
International Education and Research

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Institute and we were provided with

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
nothing more than the target's name

69
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,220
the outcome is we got in we've managed

70
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,860
to get domain admin credentials

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,200
so take a look at the red teaming

72
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,420
process is similar to a penetration test

73
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,640
but with slightly different objectives

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,739
so first we got Rick and this is the

75
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,500
most important step next we're trying to

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,220
get in and achieve a persistence next

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,099
we're doing internal Discovery next we

78
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,560
try to escalate and at the end we're

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,540
doing post-explitation activities which

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,459
resolve the final impact

81
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,280
all those steps are done with the even

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,760
with defensivation in mind

83
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,340
so we've done some reconnaissance on our

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,239
Target

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,000
and most of this was open source

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,379
intelligence you actually won't believe

87
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,540
how much information about you and your

88
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,840
companies is out there on the internet

89
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,580
and we were able to gather that

90
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,760
information without even communicating

91
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,099
with your environment so there's no way

92
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,319
to defend against that actually you can

93
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,879
come to me after presentation I'll

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,680
probably be able to tell you your phone

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,799
numbers your kids birthdays your dogs or

96
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,260
cats names and I wonder how many of

97
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,780
those are used as your passwords

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,360
I want okay I won't check it

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,299
so we found a couple potential targets

100
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,980
we found even some more interesting

101
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,978
stuff in case you don't see it probably

102
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,918
a gambling portal installed on one of

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,199
the subdomains of the victims so you

104
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,820
can't imagine how this is that admin

105
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,900
Works looks like they're

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
we found 36 valid credentials from third

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,699
party leaks and by valid I mean they

108
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,160
will they were actually working on the

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,660
target environment not just those

110
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,780
third-party websites and those databases

111
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,180
are available on the dark web on the

112
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,759
hacker forums mostly for free if you

113
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,259
know where to look for

114
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,540
so we got some initial photo we could

115
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,600
for example do some internal phishing or

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
business email compromise but which is

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,740
another path we explored the attack

118
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,720
surface even more and we found some

119
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,360
vulnerable applications we choose a one

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,340
that didn't have a publicly available

121
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,479
exploit so there was no signature

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,240
detections for antivirus but there was a

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,919
technical write-up for this one so with

124
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,479
little skills we were able to create our

125
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,100
own exploit

126
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,860
and this was a perfect for the task

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,620
once we got in we uploaded our custom

128
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,979
malish script uh so-called web shell

129
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,960
it's a script that allows us to execute

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,720
comments from a web form and in case

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,759
some Curious Defender would find that

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,400
script they will see only a blank page

133
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,440
there where we actually have our tools

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,660
because again I said at the at the

135
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,880
switchblade side we you gotta know how

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,380
to communicate with this to see those

137
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,800
tools

138
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,080
so we're in it's time for escalation

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Discovery and escalation and in the

140
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,639
first step we're finding domain admin

141
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,100
credentials in a clear text format in a

142
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,720
file and believe me it's not that

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,240
uncommon as you may think

144
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,639
so it practically was a game over at

145
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,919
this point but to have some a bit more

146
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,900
sophisticated attack we reverse

147
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,240
engineered and exploited some other

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,639
internal application that also stored

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
domain admin passwords reused

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,800
not not a domain user but the domain

151
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,539
password so the password was we used

152
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,400
for the Post exploitation we uploaded

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,180
our custom developed malware is a common

154
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,039
and controlled script

155
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,340
for all all further operations and all

156
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,080
of this was developed with a defense

157
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
evasion in mind so we implemented

158
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,940
obfuscation of code we implemented

159
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,699
in-memory code execution we implemented

160
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,500
encryption

161
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,600
we triggered no detection

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,020
no prevention actions were executed on

163
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,699
us

164
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,800
by the time someone noticed some

165
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,500
suspicious activity in that Network we

166
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,020
were able to already wreak havoc so we

167
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,919
downloaded all users password hashes we

168
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,380
escalated across multiple domains on

169
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,759
that environment

170
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,280
we exfiltrated some sensitive documents

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,160
and we encrypted the computers

172
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,220
we didn't but we could we did if we we

173
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,660
would do that if we were the bad guys

174
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,660
summarizing the problems first what I

175
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,759
call unknown unknowns you can't protect

176
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,400
what you don't know about so you gotta

177
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,380
perform regular asset Discovery and

178
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,900
maintain an asset inventory it showed up

179
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,819
that some of the assets that we targeted

180
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,979
were actually not monitored not covered

181
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,280
by by the monitoring systems

182
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,740
and from that gambling site that we've

183
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,800
seen you can imagine that the it was not

184
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
even aware what they have in their

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,380
environment

186
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,440
problem number two so sensitive files in

187
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,539
a clear text I mean we see it multiple

188
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,000
times on our on our printers on the

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,940
notes on the scripts on the computers

190
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,400
and you can have a security clean desk

191
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,340
policy but it's hard to enforce it so

192
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,080
you can use something like data

193
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,360
classification tools to identify where

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,800
you store sensitive information

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,539
third you can have a good antivirus

196
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,280
system but as long as as it's only

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,560
signature based it will fail for a

198
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,240
custom malware and it's not that hard to

199
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,759
develop one use modern solutions like

200
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,419
EDR xdr also just for the node antivirus

201
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,759
can be simply disabled and you won't see

202
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,220
that for the ADR and xdr you can

203
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,080
probably see something like this in a

204
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,599
network logs in a sock in the CM

205
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,000
Solutions and last but not least

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,640
password policy and I will only say this

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,059
please please don't reuse passwords and

208
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,279
don't use administrative accounts for a

209
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
daily task use multiple Factor

210
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,200
authentication whenever you can use

211
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,519
additional accounts for daily activities

212
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,580
another case is another retaining

213
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,360
assessment uh also this time we are

214
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,860
provided with nothing more but the

215
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,160
victim name a large European University

216
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,260
and the goal was to get behind the

217
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,060
perimeter get inside and explore the

218
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,399
attacker's possibilities

219
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,040
and we got in and we also executed the

220
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,959
malware

221
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,519
on internal assets from a low privileged

222
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,260
user so again we've done some

223
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,700
reconnaissance with open source

224
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,519
intelligence a lot of those actually and

225
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,980
again we've found some leaked credential

226
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,220
this time actually over 5 000 passwords

227
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,880
and we validated around 10 to 15 percent

228
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,339
of the out of those were valid on that

229
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,740
environment and just for the record the

230
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,000
bad guys only need one

231
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,399
on one of the endpoints we found

232
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,040
sort of sandboxed remote desktop it was

233
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,320
supposed to allow the users to run only

234
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,899
the whitelisted secure applications so

235
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,180
we logged in using the compromised the

236
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,220
delete password

237
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,180
and inside we were able to escape the

238
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,940
sandbox using so-called kiosk mode

239
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,399
breakout technique so you probably all

240
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,380
know in the in the stores they have the

241
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,779
like demo modes on the computer so

242
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,640
pretty much the same technique that we

243
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,399
use so we escaped the sandbox and in the

244
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,339
end we were able to run any comment and

245
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,800
any application on the system this

246
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,080
should not be possible

247
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
and bear in mind no malware was used for

248
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,019
that attack to get till this point we

249
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,940
just abused the trust

250
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,160
of the vendor of the client that the

251
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,839
sandbox is

252
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,000
can be can be escaped

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,980
so the problems here

254
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,620
lack of threat modeling so you need to

255
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,779
understand the threat sources and threat

256
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,580
boundaries and Implement proper security

257
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,459
at each one of them you gotta also

258
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,019
understand the technology that you're

259
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,180
using the vendor providers for such a

260
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,560
Sandbox Solutions

261
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,140
inform their clients that the sandbox

262
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,820
should not be used as a security

263
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,079
boundary

264
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,360
but I see multiple times the platforms

265
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,459
are deployed without even looking at the

266
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,260
security guidelines provided by the

267
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,360
vendors and most of the vendors provide

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,300
such as such guidelines

269
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,860
another case is a phishing so not that

270
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,779
exciting but actually it is interesting

271
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,640
how we managed to bypass the ante

272
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,019
phishing protection not the user

273
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,160
awareness

274
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,620
uh we got we had two cases here so in

275
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,380
the first one we were able to bypass a

276
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,839
leading industry anti-fishing protection

277
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,200
because of the problems because of the

278
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,800
weakness how it was implemented so

279
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,779
instead of the maze going through the

280
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,899
anti-fishing solution we were able to

281
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,700
send the image directly to the mail

282
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,560
server and we abused the fact that the

283
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,100
mail provider creates a predictable

284
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,860
obvious names for the mail servers and

285
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,860
if any of you is using Office 365 you

286
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,120
might take a look if you don't have a

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,100
similar case

288
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,040
second example we second case of

289
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,740
phishing we actually bypassed one of the

290
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,779
basics protection mechanisms for the

291
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,000
email protection which is SPF sender

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,860
policy Frameworks

293
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,800
this policy should prevent everyone on

294
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,740
the internet to send emails on behalf of

295
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,060
any domain and we abuse the fact that

296
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,079
the provider of the email actually says

297
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,200
to their customers to trust all the all

298
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,720
the IP ranges their own as a trusted

299
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
sender so we simply bought a server and

300
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,760
the provider and we were able to send

301
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,660
the email from actual looking like an

302
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,700
actual email from the victim and just

303
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,160
just for

304
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,019
telling how normally we're we're buying

305
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,600
some similar naming domains which is

306
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,480
called typo squattings but sometimes

307
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,440
it's

308
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,540
it's marked it's highlighted by the male

309
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,880
clients and this time the email was

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,680
actually looking like it was sent from

311
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,060
someone on the victim domain

312
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,279
summarizing the problems again no

313
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
malware was used here

314
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,180
and no actually no sophisticated

315
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,160
phishing techniques

316
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,600
you gotta understand the security

317
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,940
controls you gotta perform threat

318
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,600
modeling and consulted with experts and

319
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,940
don't trust your third-party providers

320
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,680
security assurance

321
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,500
you you need to test it you need to take

322
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,420
it into account in your own security

323
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,319
risk assessment

324
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,399
last example was supposed to be a

325
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,680
typical web application penetration test

326
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,540
for one of the applications of a large

327
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,459
Software House

328
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,860
the outcome was that we were able to

329
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,500
compromise all the client applications

330
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,720
of that software house we took control

331
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
of their hosting environment and we even

332
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,680
took control of their development

333
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,519
environment so not that boring at all

334
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,560
to quickly go through what happened so

335
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
we compromise the web application

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,519
through like a normal cross-site

337
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,519
scripting typical case then we abuse the

338
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,040
trust between the web application and

339
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,600
the development environment to

340
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,720
infiltrate the development environment

341
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,420
then we again we abused another trust

342
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,519
between the development environment and

343
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,160
the hosting environment we escalated to

344
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,220
the hosting administrator uh exploiting

345
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,620
some outdated application that was

346
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,720
supposed to be only visible from the

347
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,160
inside

348
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,800
and at the end we were able to place

349
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,839
malware in all the web applications

350
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,480
hosted we were able to leak the data of

351
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,519
all the client applications the software

352
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,920
house had and we even were able to

353
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,100
inject malicious code into every new

354
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,980
application they will release because we

355
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,959
exfiltrated we compromised the

356
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,660
development environment

357
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,839
and going through the problems so first

358
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,199
there was too much trust and as much as

359
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,600
I don't like the buzzword the zero trust

360
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,779
is the case here so you can't assume the

361
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,180
two of your own assets can communicate

362
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,920
without any additional verification

363
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,500
because you own them you got it

364
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,160
you gotta check security and verify it

365
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,980
at every point because at some point

366
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,560
everything can be compromised

367
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,260
don't reuse passwords again we abuse

368
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,000
actually the fact that hosting

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,620
environment and the development

370
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,720
environment use the same password so

371
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,180
there should be MFA use the mf8 would

372
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,699
stop us prevent us from using

373
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,160
compromised password

374
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,920
and again asset Discovery so we

375
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,779
exploited an application that was

376
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,480
outdated but it was not used by the

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,260
clients so they didn't assume it's risky

378
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,139
but they should probably discover the

379
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,699
application and remove it because it's

380
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,060
not used

381
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,260
summarizing

382
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,959
security is about layers and you gotta

383
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,600
Implement security controls at each of

384
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,339
this layers not just single one because

385
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,260
you you need to remember that the impact

386
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,300
is at the end not in the middle

387
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,979
and it's not always about malware

388
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,560
and we have us per minute so

389
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,579
an extra case

390
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,959
once you think you're

391
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,959
network is secure then you got to take a

392
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,540
look at your physical security here the

393
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,199
team was able to get inside the biggest

394
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,180
facility Electronics facilities in the

395
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,240
Poland we actually pretended to be a

396
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,459
CCTV service we had a legitimate

397
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,980
purchase orders

398
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,120
some

399
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,579
kind person have left the open doors for

400
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,940
us and another kind person have left us

401
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,160
the access card so we could clone this

402
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,459
one there were Network ports all over

403
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,139
the place so we Simply Connected our

404
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,339
devices and were able to do some

405
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,399
some internal hacking and the last thing

406
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,320
is a little device that is in our

407
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,779
internal also now I have it here it's

408
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,660
called called flipper zero the device

409
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,099
can clone any radio signal or near field

410
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,579
so access card and we can reuse this

411
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,040
signal so if any one of you can want to

412
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,280
try it you have remotes to your Gates

413
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,099
or anything you can try to to just press

414
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,780
it and see if I can capture the signal

415
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,860
yeah actually

416
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,919
I got something so I can now save and

417
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,620
reuse the signal to do whatever it is

418
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,360
doing

419
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,649
