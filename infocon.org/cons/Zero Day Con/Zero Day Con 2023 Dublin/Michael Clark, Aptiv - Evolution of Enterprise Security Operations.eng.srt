00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,500
[Music]

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
it's quite the audience we have out here

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,900
today

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,860
um

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,300
coming off of the heels of international

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,460
women's day yesterday when I walked in

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,780
here and I was sitting in the corner I

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,000
looked around I said wow you know I'm

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,440
amazed at how many women we have in the

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,180
audience so why don't we just get a

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,380
little engagement raise your hand if

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,019
you're a woman in the audience here

13
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,760
look at that I mean that's amazing so

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,599
when I started in security operations

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,220
uh about 12 years ago I worked in a

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,559
soccer security operations center about

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
50 50 people I should say 50 men because

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,540
it was 50 men and two women and now

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,000
that's what four percent and now we're

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
looking at I'd say 20 to 30 percent of

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,540
the people in the audience today are

22
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,520
women I think that's fantastic so quick

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
Round of Applause for women all the

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,420
women in the audience today

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,399
glad to have it

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,020
so today I want to talk to you a little

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,480
bit about the evolution of Enterprise

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,780
security operations as I've seen it over

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,660
the past 12 years before I dive into

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,939
that I want to tell you a little bit

31
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,260
about myself and I'll tell you a little

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,540
bit about active aptives a automotive

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,920
technology company

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,780
roughly 190 000 employees 200 locations

35
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,979
across the globe very difficult to

36
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,960
manage from a cyber security perspective

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,479
uh that said I'll tell you a little bit

38
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,920
about myself

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,979
um

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,040
we've seen some pictures today of what

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,600
hackers don't look like well let me show

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
you what they might look like okay this

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,640
is Christmas 1994. that's me eight years

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,460
old no I'm not a hacker but that's what

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,380
this is what the attacker might look

46
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,880
like

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,040
um so a little bit about me 30 years of

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,659
Hands-On keyboard experience starting

49
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,840
right about then over the last decade

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,119
focused on cyber security

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,740
various Enterprise organizations active

52
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,600
PTC out of Boston before that United

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,479
Natural Foods

54
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,460
there's been lots of challenges over the

55
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,020
years and I've seen some some major

56
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,159
changes

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,380
my biggest strength is just drastically

58
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,419
simplifying complex issues security

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,879
operations is definitely a complex issue

60
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,980
so I'd like to share sort of my

61
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,780
experience with that and how I think we

62
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,920
can all benefit going forward

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
so these are the things I'm going to

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,700
talk to you about the history as I see

65
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,800
it of cyber security operations having

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,360
one throat to choke what has changed

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,860
introduction of devops into the

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,780
Enterprise

69
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,180
business-led I.T and know that that m a

70
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,940
m and Ampersand being crossed out is not

71
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,760
a mistake there's no more M A's right so

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,080
there's no more mergers in Acquisitions

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,700
there's just Acquisitions companies just

74
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,800
buying companies and never merging them

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
in

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,760
that's a big big challenge so where are

77
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,940
we today uh distributed responsibility I

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,440
was telling somebody yesterday I hate

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,200
the term shared responsibility AWS and

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
Amazon they all talk about shared

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,959
responsibility

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,459
I don't really see it as shared

83
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,260
responsibility it's really distributive

84
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,459
responsibility

85
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,379
we'll talk a little bit about that and

86
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,099
then the path forward

87
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,980
so while I was putting this together the

88
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,319
thought crossed my mind is uh is what

89
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm going to be telling them today

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,739
something they could just go to they

91
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,920
could get from AI they go to chat GPT

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,420
and I was like I've never used it before

93
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,959
so I went on I asked chat GPT how have

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,300
cyber security operations changed over

95
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,140
the years

96
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,720
and I was actually surprised it actually

97
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,760
came back with a pretty good you know

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,280
paragraph a few bullet points of how

99
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,840
things have changed I said wow this this

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
actually reads really well if I was back

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,500
in my college days like writing essays

102
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,940
would be a lot easier

103
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,580
uh so some of the things that spit out

104
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,560
increased Reliance on Automation and

105
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,540
machine technology very true I mean

106
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,340
these are these are things that are

107
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,440
almost necessary nowadays because of the

108
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,720
pace how quickly things move greater

109
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,580
emphasis on proactive security

110
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,459
absolutely finding threats before before

111
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,739
they find you

112
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:06,120
integration of security in the devops

113
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,739
devops is everywhere now it's like

114
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,560
popcorn every day some new devops team

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,299
is popping up in in my organization

116
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,819
anyways

117
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,500
a shift to cloud-based security things

118
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,199
moving very very quickly and increased

119
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,060
collaboration and sharing of threat

120
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,580
intelligence so I thought again this is

121
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,800
this is good information it's almost

122
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,960
reads like marketing material to me but

123
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,580
uh you know what let's let's take it one

124
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,160
first step further so chat GPT what's

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
the biggest challenge of cyber security

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
operations again it came back with a

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,860
response that I was like well this is

128
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,780
pretty impressive this is going to put

129
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,520
me out of a job pretty soon

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,460
uh so complexity compliance budget

131
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,699
constraints uh let's do one more uh

132
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,259
engagement how many people have dealt

133
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,240
with budget constraints in their cyber

134
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,580
security program anybody anybody's arms

135
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,340
working today yeah every single day it's

136
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,840
a budget constraint I want to hire more

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,900
people I want to buy more tools uh it's

138
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,720
always always begging for money and user

139
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,639
Behavior Uh

140
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,759
users really are the the weakest link

141
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,880
um I think that user education awareness

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,240
and training is huge but it's uh it's

143
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,040
it's one of the many challenges that we

144
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,139
have to deal with so overall chat GPT

145
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,720
did a great job but it was lacking a

146
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,580
little bit of the experience that I'm

147
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,160
going to share with you today

148
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,660
so great good job AI you got a little

149
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,600
ways to go but keep up the good work

150
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
so let's talk about the history so the

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,039
history of security operations

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,560
when I started in cyber security or even

153
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,960
before cyber security

154
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,620
if there was a a problem with a server

155
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,900
let's say server got infected it's

156
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,539
compromised who do we go to oh you go to

157
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,400
the server team and talk to Joe he

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,139
manages the server team

159
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,479
uh if there was a problem with a network

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,240
switch who do you go to oh that's go to

161
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
the network team talk to Lisa she

162
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,240
manages the network team

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,340
where's that documented nowhere it's up

164
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,680
here it's nice and easy we got one team

165
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,500
one network team to to talk to One

166
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,680
server team to talk to very easy

167
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,120
things have changed a little bit

168
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,940
we've got Acquisitions so companies like

169
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,680
the one I I work for I'm sure your

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
companies too are constantly looking to

171
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
add new companies to their portfolios

172
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,740
right

173
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,139
there is no more emerging it's hey we

174
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,280
want to bring this company we're going

175
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,380
to buy this company and we just kind of

176
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,000
want to let them operate on their own

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,259
for a little bit we're gonna we don't

178
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,699
want to touch them don't bother them

179
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,560
stay hands off we're going to give them

180
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,360
a corporate laptop but everything else

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
just kind of let them do their own thing

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,639
that creates a huge gap for security now

183
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,680
you've got potentially multiple security

184
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
teams or

185
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,220
the company may have one security person

186
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,979
that's doing everything

187
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,620
uh is all of a sudden you don't have you

188
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,180
don't have one team responding to

189
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,600
security alerts you've got uh compliance

190
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,319
gaps so M A's are just A's Acquisitions

191
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,780
are big source of of trouble for cyber

192
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,819
Security Professionals

193
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,100
devops like I said devops teams are

194
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,600
popping up like popcorn and you never

195
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,979
know when the next one's going to pop up

196
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,800
so devops they like to manage all of

197
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,539
their own infrastructure and when a

198
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,699
devops team comes up comes on board or

199
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,319
you know starts working and you find out

200
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,120
okay they're standing up public-facing

201
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,919
services

202
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,259
there that's a whole new set of point of

203
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,300
contacts to communicate with right so

204
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,759
let's say even if you are managing or

205
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,280
monitoring uh the cloud environments

206
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,539
because maybe they're working out of

207
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,520
azure and you're hooked into their Cloud

208
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,440
environment to pull alerts and get into

209
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,539
your sock you still have to know who to

210
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,759
contact right so something goes on hey

211
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,680
we got a vulnerability on this system or

212
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,220
we're seeing some some ioc activity who

213
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,860
do I contact so it's not it's not that

214
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,780
one throat to choke anymore it's not oh

215
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,000
go talk to the network theme or the

216
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
network manager or the server team

217
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,599
manager that's all right we need to go

218
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,720
to a spreadsheet see okay this assets

219
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,060
this cloud and Cloud This Cloud accounts

220
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,819
owned by this person we talk to them

221
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,220
they don't uh they don't actually own

222
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,139
the cloud account the devops team but

223
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,819
they can tell you who do who does so

224
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,380
it's it's kind of tracking down those

225
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,300
business owners

226
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,280
next in that and that kind of leads to

227
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,620
business-led I.T so business-led I.T

228
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,120
kind of goes hand in hand with devops

229
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,160
but not necessarily so you might have

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,680
sites where there are there are a

231
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,560
manufacturing site and they're not

232
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,719
essentially managed by the corporate it

233
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,899
team what they have is an I.T manager

234
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,880
he's one guy one guy manages the whole

235
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,458
site and he's the point of contact for

236
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,320
anything that's going on there and what

237
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,959
that leads to is a lot of what I call

238
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,120
under managed devices not necessarily

239
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,620
unmanaged because technically they've

240
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
got an I.T manager right and that's his

241
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,100
job but they're under managed devices

242
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,620
not all devices have endpoint protection

243
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,240
on them some of them do some of them

244
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,220
don't some of them are set up to log to

245
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,380
the Sim and some of them are that's a

246
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,180
huge gap that creates more gaps in the

247
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,620
security operations portfolio

248
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,480
also we have a tech savvy Workforce so I

249
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
don't know how many of you remember

250
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,899
Oregon Trail but uh you've got people

251
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,180
who grow up are growing up today or grew

252
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,760
up you know 20 years ago with Oregon

253
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,060
Trail and started on computers and now

254
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,040
you've got this tech savvy Workforce

255
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,160
says I can just manage my own PC uh you

256
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,380
know I can I can uh I've got some I.T

257
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,120
experience they're looking for a site

258
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,980
manager for this site I'll be the I.T

259
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,320
site manager why not and that's great

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,399
but

261
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,140
if you don't go to school you don't have

262
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
the proper training and you don't have

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,860
the experience there's a big difference

264
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,720
between using a computer

265
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,240
in administering it right so there's a

266
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,399
lot of people who have gotten into the

267
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,220
workforce are or great and Savvy which

268
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,540
is great I think it's great that we have

269
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,720
people that are tech savvy but uh there

270
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,300
has to be a recognition that there are

271
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,680
controls that need to be put in place

272
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,200
there's safeguards and I think most

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,420
people do understand that but it has to

274
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,640
be balanced it's all balanced with the

275
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,920
business objectives

276
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,899
so where does that leave us well it

277
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,100
might leave you with something like this

278
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,740
where you've got dozens of teams where

279
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,540
you know 10 years ago you could count

280
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,519
all of your your server team your

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,320
network team on one hand now you can't

282
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,360
even count the number of teams on all

283
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,880
your hands and your feet together

284
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,360
so you really need to have

285
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,940
some way of keeping track of all these

286
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
points of contacts all of these

287
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,440
escalation procedures

288
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,800
um who who the site contacts are

289
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
uh

290
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,100
because it's not something you can just

291
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,899
remember in your head anymore right it's

292
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,700
it's it's something where it needs to be

293
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,260
documented otherwise you're going to

294
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,560
have inconsistent escalations today we

295
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,360
got a ticket for this asset we escalate

296
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,220
to this person tomorrow we escalate to

297
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,899
somebody else because it's not written

298
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,899
down anywhere so you have to have some

299
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,360
form of of document some system to keep

300
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,040
track of all these things and pull them

301
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,300
together

302
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,380
it really goes back to uh the nist CSF

303
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,660
I've most of you probably heard of it

304
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,779
the identify phase of the nist CSF so

305
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,820
let's identify protect the tech respond

306
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,220
and recover the identify phase where

307
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,440
we're really talking about inventorying

308
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,000
your Hardware assets your software

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,920
assets and the stakeholders making sure

310
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,500
you've got all those pieces together and

311
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,320
documented uh to serve as the foundation

312
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,959
for your security operations program

313
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,519
so let's talk a little bit about the

314
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,380
path forward here this is a

315
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,560
how I see things so the old way asset

316
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,000
ownership information was common

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,399
knowledge right again

318
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,920
server go to the server team network

319
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
switch router go to the network team

320
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,839
that has to go away that mentality has

321
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,640
to go away things need to be documented

322
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
now you need a system like like a

323
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,040
servicenow or a remedy ticking system

324
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,079
where you're leveraging their cmdb

325
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,300
you're pulling all this information into

326
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,200
the cmdb and integrating it with the

327
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,640
security operations center and that last

328
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,079
part is critical because if you just

329
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,240
have the information there and it's not

330
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,620
tied into your security operations

331
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,240
center you're not making it available to

332
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,339
them it's still pretty useless or at

333
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,079
minimum they're still going to be manual

334
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,940
processes involved right

335
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,399
so pulling out information so that when

336
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,260
an alert comes in your security

337
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,180
operations team hey here's a ticket

338
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,839
we've got this XYZ popped on on a system

339
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
uh yeah malicious piece of software

340
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,459
showed up who do we reach out to point

341
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,100
of contacts there escalation procedures

342
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,700
contact information hey this you know we

343
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,260
don't want to be talked we don't want to

344
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,360
be called between the hours of midnight

345
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,019
and 8 A.M and if you can't reach us

346
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,579
here's the next person the chain experts

347
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,839
in the chain all that needs to be

348
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,360
fleshed out or else you can't really

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,459
have an effective security operations

350
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,180
team this is some of this information is

351
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,480
is common sense if you're setting up a a

352
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,360
managed security services provider but

353
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,579
it hasn't really been common sense for

354
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,519
Enterprises because the historical

355
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,260
Enterprise has just been that simple

356
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,240
simple setup where

357
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,279
we just know who to go to and it hasn't

358
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,680
been so complex but now with all

359
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,380
acquisitions coming on board devops

360
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,899
teams business-led I.T and under managed

361
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,839
devices there's so many more points of

362
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,820
contacts that you have to have so it's

363
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,700
really important to to take a structured

364
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,740
documented approach to your security

365
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,980
operations and and escalation procedure

366
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,360
really treating

367
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,779
each of those groups as a customer so

368
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,040
you're you've got to remember you're

369
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,360
really providing a service to the

370
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,820
business and you have to treat those

371
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,399
individual groups as customers we each

372
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,260
sometimes each with different escalation

373
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,300
procedures different ways of treating

374
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,760
things

375
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,139
and and taking that kind of services

376
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,620
first approach

377
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,360
so asset owner contact info really

378
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,980
should not be stored in spreadsheets

379
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,420
that's kind of the evolution I've seen

380
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,579
originally it was okay it's just stored

381
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,320
up here I know who to contact things

382
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,880
started to get a little more complex we

383
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,100
started putting it in spreadsheets well

384
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,200
uh spreadsheets are really good at one

385
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,440
thing becoming outdated so getting that

386
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,660
information out of spreadsheets into a

387
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,120
system a system of record like a cmdb

388
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,880
where the contacts get emailed quarterly

389
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,160
and are asked to update their contact

390
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,079
information their escalation procedures

391
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,899
that's critical because if you're not if

392
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:37,860
you're not following up with your

393
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,720
customers and saying hey can you make

394
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,579
sure your information is still accurate

395
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,899
they're not going to go out of the way

396
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,060
nobody's no I.T manager or any business

397
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,339
manager or devops team is going to wake

398
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,839
up in the morning and say

399
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,300
you know I haven't updated my my contact

400
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,220
info and I changed my phone a couple

401
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,199
weeks ago let me go into the system and

402
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,120
update that so it's important that

403
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,199
you're following up you're being

404
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,180
proactive and that's how you provide a

405
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,980
good service to your to your uh to your

406
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,260
customers

407
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,360
um vulnerability data being reported to

408
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,160
asset owners manually this is kind of

409
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,380
the old way

410
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,760
bringing

411
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
10 years ago the new systems being

412
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
brought up hey we want to scan it for

413
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
vulnerabilities

414
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,399
before we go live now okay let me run a

415
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,860
manual scan I'll send you that that uh

416
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,899
that scan via email

417
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,180
that's a very manual process that should

418
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,760
really all be entirely automated so the

419
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,139
scanning should be automated should be

420
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,220
built into the server build process the

421
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,260
distribution of those reports all needs

422
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,120
to be automated and this is where kind

423
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,100
of chat GPT did hit it on the nail on

424
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,600
the nail on the head a little bit with

425
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,360
uh with automation but it needs to be

426
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,860
completely automated

427
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,540
you should have a vulnerability

428
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,060
management policy with a matrix of hey

429
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,019
asset criticality

430
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,180
CVSs vulnerability severity there should

431
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,639
be an SLA associated with each uh you

432
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,260
know each Square in that box each of

433
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,019
that Matrix and reports should go out to

434
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,620
the owners based on on on the SLA all

435
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,480
that should be automated and if there's

436
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,399
there are some systems

437
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,620
out there that'll get that get close to

438
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,839
doing that today but I think our

439
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,760
Technologies and that takes us to the

440
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,839
last bullet point here is our

441
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,240
Technologies our Tech Stacks still have

442
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,339
a way to go because the tech Stacks are

443
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,500
really being built with like a single

444
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,600
customer in mind

445
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,160
um you know some of them are good with

446
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,079
they've got more flexible role-based

447
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,360
Access Control

448
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,579
uh some of them might even have like a

449
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,699
concept of multi-tenant but nobody's

450
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,759
really doing a great job of pulling all

451
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,560
that information together in one spot

452
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,660
and making and giving you the

453
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,300
flexibility to do what you need to do as

454
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,000
a growing Enterprise to service multiple

455
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,880
customers so that's that's my experience

456
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,920
with uh

457
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,680
um Enterprise operations over the last

458
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,160
12 years or so in security

459
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,040
you know I think tool integration sock

460
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,959
metrics management of sock metrics if

461
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,099
you're not monitoring it you're not

462
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,799
managing it business must be empowered

463
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,059
with the information needs to make

464
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,859
intelligent choices so we're really here

465
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,059
to provide

466
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,699
analysis to the the business I think one

467
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,799
mentality we get stuck in with as cyber

468
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,660
security folks is they have to do this

469
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,520
you know we need to you know you can't

470
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,079
put this on the network unless it is

471
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,839
completely compliant that's not the

472
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
reality of the situation right so it's

473
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
it's providing that analysis to the the

474
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
key decision holders say hey this is an

475
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,020
old system we can put these safeguards

476
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,940
in place these but these are the risks

477
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,620
and you have to accept that you know you

478
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,240
can't let yourself get frustrated as a

479
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,740
cyber security professional just because

480
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,360
the business doesn't want to do

481
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,799
everything you say you want you want

482
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,660
them to do as much as that would make it

483
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,720
make our lives easy but uh you know just

484
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,940
uh have to kind of make sure you're

485
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,440
floating that information up to the

486
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,580
business so they can make a good

487
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,879
decision

488
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,799
and focusing on scaling scalable

489
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,380
solutions that don't burn out your sock

490
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,000
teams so

491
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
uh with that said I'd like to wrap up uh

492
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,120
thank you all for uh for coming

493
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,409
