14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,820
I possibly leave you out uh you're all

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,960
very welcome thank you very much guys

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,280
lovely to see you

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
um um I want to do is obviously we've

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,820
had a wonderful introduction there

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,620
um from Michael Jenny I might get you

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,360
give us in about 30 seconds what you do

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,059
with Ayan yeah so aeon is a cyber cyber

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,399
insurance broker basically my job is a

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,980
technical translator and I also take the

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,360
black and white and add a little bit of

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,860
gray so a lot of the forms that our

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,660
clients have to fill out they're all yes

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,160
or no and I think everyone in this room

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
knows it's not a yes and no kind of game

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,780
so really my job is to talk to the heads

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,400
of it and to pull out what compensating

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,780
controls they have so how can they

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,340
become a better risk for the insurers

33
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,280
excellent Jonathan uh so I'm the CIO for

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,260
The Institute cancer research and we're

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,140
a kind of unique organization that we

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,900
um work from bench to bedside

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,479
um on discovering treatments for cancer

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,420
very good and uh Andrew I'm the director

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,820
of Essie's for force again in Europe so

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,280
we help our customers you know plan and

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
architect how our solutions would go

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,159
into their networks and environments

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,100
okay so the title of this panel it's 2

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,259
am your data is gone how did you get

45
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:40,979
here

46
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,479
um and honestly it is it is the

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,979
nightmare scenario and I mean at

48
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,140
Jonathan last year uh you you were

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,460
giving a presentation here about you

50
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,540
know particularly when you talk about

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,299
patient information and and you know

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,340
sensitive documentation people who are

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,220
vulnerable and if you lose their data

54
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,280
it's on your shoulders so it is it is

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
the nightmare scenario isn't it that so

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,939
many businesses have found themselves in

57
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,700
since we last spoke yeah so I mean

58
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,160
particularly for someone like icr which

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,700
is the the intersection of health and

60
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,620
Academia so if you remember back to one

61
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,200
of the previous present slides

62
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,060
um there's a real intersection there so

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,819
if it is 2 A.M I think whilst I've got

64
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,800
I've got kind of two points I'd like to

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,260
go on first how do we get here

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,940
um and we've we've talked a lot about it

67
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,099
being a people business

68
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,319
um and we've all had you know phishing

69
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,239
campaigns and we've all had cyber

70
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,280
security awareness and acceptable youth

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
policies right we've all got that right

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
but still almost 70 percent of employees

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,140
when asked will admit that they have

74
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,080
circumvented security controls right and

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,879
I do wonder if there's another 20 that

76
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,340
just won't admit to it at least 20

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,319
percent yeah so and I know one instance

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,360
where an organization was compromised

79
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,640
because an individual was was in his bed

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,400
at night and his phone kept pinging and

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,860
it was a multi-factor thing and it kept

82
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,739
pinging and it kept pinging and he kept

83
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:05,700
pinging

84
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,560
and then he click yes and guess what

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
stop pinging yeah yeah yeah so he was

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,140
very happy and he went to sleep

87
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,540
meanwhile his organization was

88
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,420
eviscerated right so so these things

89
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,459
happen right so it has to be with the

90
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,840
people we had to start with the people

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,080
how can we make cyber both easy to use

92
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,319
so that people find it easier to make

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,599
the right choices rather than make the

94
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,340
work and it all comes back down to

95
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,900
people at the end of the day that that's

96
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,220
the common theme that's coming through

97
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,680
but when it comes to resilience Jenny

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,720
what is the point of cyber resilience I

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,459
mean what if you're to try to explain it

100
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,459
to apply the gray as you describe it how

101
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,959
do you do it what what are you telling

102
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,760
people this is what we're talking about

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
so really cyber resilience is about

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,500
managing the impact of managing the

105
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,940
likelihood of the impact right so you

106
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,200
have to take the stance that you've

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
already been breached so now you've been

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,739
breached what do you need to do to get

109
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,659
your operations up and running I think

110
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,220
as well data is very important you have

111
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,080
to take like a data Centric stance right

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
so have you got data classification is

113
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,920
it done have you done data value

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
assessments so you can use nist 860 for

115
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,420
this it's okay it's good but it's very

116
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,760
documented and so those are the kind of

117
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,019
things that you need to look at again

118
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,899
backups right are they offline are they

119
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,418
encrypted are they immutable do you know

120
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,040
that in the world the worst of the worst

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,900
happens like are they playing backups

122
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,639
are you now just uploading more malware

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,960
into your systems do you know that kind

124
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,040
of way so these are the things you need

125
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
to know and also have cyber Insurance

126
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,259
get the retainer there so when it all

127
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,300
happens you literally have in your phone

128
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,919
you know exactly who to call you know

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,840
exactly who you need in the room you can

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,340
get that containment lockdown and

131
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,479
they'll also help you then with the

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,919
communications right so if it's customer

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,020
data you need to tell your customers you

134
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,520
need to tell your board can I just

135
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,580
taking a step back and again last night

136
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,800
I was watching the TV show about MH370

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,940
the Malaysia Airlines plane that

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,139
disappeared it was very interesting that

139
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,520
I hadn't seen before which was in the

140
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,860
crisis room in Malaysia Airways because

141
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,259
they had absolutely no Concepts that

142
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,460
something like this could happen and it

143
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,440
was interesting to watch that room in

144
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,580
particular and I was kind of sitting

145
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,560
there going if I was in that room what

146
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,720
would I do you know you we have an

147
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,759
immutable problem yeah playing is gone

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,220
we don't know where it is we had plans

149
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,340
for other things so that's the conundrum

150
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,139
isn't it that you don't know what the

151
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,820
problem is going to be exactly until

152
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,800
you're in that crisis and it's about the

153
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,419
systems you've set up to that point to

154
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,860
make sure that they can respond and I

155
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,300
think the biggest Pitfall there is

156
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,680
relying on a plan that you haven't

157
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
actually tested right it's all by then

158
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,100
go writing a plan when everyone's calm

159
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,259
and well slept but when you know when

160
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,120
the heat is on the gloves are off you

161
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,320
need to know that you can stand over

162
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,600
that plan and it will work and also

163
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
sometimes I see with my clients they

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,320
have a great plan and it has been tested

165
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,940
but it does include ransomware it

166
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,740
doesn't include the key cyber risks that

167
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,120
we really need to be prepared for

168
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
because like we're all going to get

169
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
breached eventually you just have to

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,500
take that standpoint yeah and Andrew

171
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,300
when it comes to

172
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
making sure that every step in the chain

173
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,560
is fully trained and educated on best

174
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
practice how do you manage that because

175
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
again people are different and people

176
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,820
are different levels of understanding

177
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,220
and you you have to produce guidelines

178
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,199
that are easy to follow so how do you go

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,400
about that to ensure that you are

180
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,320
resilient I think you know for people

181
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,840
times you take uh how they how everyone

182
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,400
reacts to training and how everyone

183
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,620
reacts to situations differently you

184
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,960
start getting awareness out there across

185
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,280
an organization how they're going to

186
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,660
work you know kind of what the things

187
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,000
are and bring them in slowly and surely

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
I think trying to load on a lot of

189
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,300
training and a lot of testing on people

190
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
straight away doesn't help you've got to

191
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,380
step through the processes make it make

192
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,120
a nice neat vignette of information

193
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
which is relevant to them and then also

194
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,539
that they understand why they're doing

195
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,880
it and there's a kind of a sequence of

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
trust that they have to come back and

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,300
say to you that I can tell you when

198
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,680
something goes wrong and it doesn't work

199
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,300
right when you do your testing that

200
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,860
didn't work we need to do this because

201
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,660
that will you know that won't work but

202
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,120
there's there's training people in how

203
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,919
to prevent a breach okay and that we

204
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,440
talked endlessly about that do we train

205
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,900
people enough on how to react if there

206
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,520
is a breach

207
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,460
no not at all and again it comes down to

208
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,960
your kind of you have to run to those

209
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,479
training programs of saying let's do a

210
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,220
test for each how it works how it's

211
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,360
going to organize

212
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,680
um I've done some work with different

213
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
military organizations because they're

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,520
brilliant at testing themselves in in in

215
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,620
an environment where they go we go and

216
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,479
do drills and like they do live drills

217
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,699
live drills live drills before they go

218
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,800
out on site because you when when you

219
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,660
actually go into a war scenario or a

220
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,000
situation where it's highly stressful

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
your training kicks in properly when you

222
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,880
do enough drills and you have to keep

223
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,800
doing that you cannot let it say let's

224
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,380
do a testing of a scenario every 12

225
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,180
months you've got to go and have some of

226
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,099
those scenarios every so often so people

227
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,599
are aware of what they're doing it and

228
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,039
how and how it's going to be good for

229
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,660
them when it comes to a scenario that

230
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,099
you do get breached and you do you are

231
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,120
sitting there four in the morning

232
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
wondering what's going on Michael

233
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,000
because nobody wants that call that that

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
2AM call is what you don't want

235
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,440
um I do training exercises every now and

236
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
then with organizations where for me

237
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,979
it's tremendous fun we go and we blow

238
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,380
things up are we we breach things or we

239
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,240
do all sorts of craziness and it's funny

240
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
and interesting to watch how a senior

241
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,720
management team will respond to that

242
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
because you're waiting for them to

243
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,060
respond in certain ways and you're

244
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,139
waiting for them to do certain things

245
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,620
and you know you can prepare so much but

246
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,479
ultimately it's human beings at the end

247
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,120
of the day human beings are fallible and

248
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,699
even in a crisis they can make mistakes

249
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,500
and sometimes make things worse so how

250
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,599
do you build in resilience to ensure

251
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,099
that you don't make a bad situation

252
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,500
worse by actions absolutely well the

253
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,120
first thing I'll say is if it's 2 A.M

254
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
and my data is gone uh I'm calling my

255
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,020
sock manager who's going to reach out to

256
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,479
my smart Tech Team who's going to take

257
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,240
care of us but in terms of building in

258
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,099
that room that's a very good we'll use

259
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,200
that in the video for next year go on uh

260
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,940
in terms of building that resilience I

261
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,919
mean I've seen it time and time again in

262
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,020
tabletop exercise and in real incidents

263
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,540
where the incident response plan just

264
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,399
goes out the window it's like it never

265
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,740
existed and I'm usually the one who's

266
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,779
bringing it up and saying okay well are

267
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,220
we following the plan and everybody's

268
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,920
like uh maybe I'm not sure well let's

269
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,660
pull up the plan now let's go step by

270
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,459
step sometimes you need a new plan don't

271
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,680
you yeah what's that you need a new plan

272
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,720
sometimes what you've planned for it and

273
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,820
doesn't fit the scenario it's true I

274
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,680
mean the plan needs to be flexible but

275
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,480
the plan should be built in such a way

276
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
where it's not prescriptive right maybe

277
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
you've got uh appendices for different

278
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,339
events but your plan should be flexible

279
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,680
right and it should provide a baseline

280
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,019
who the stakeholders are the key players

281
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,820
are in the incident response plan who's

282
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,860
going to be making what decisions and a

283
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,360
lot of times incidents come along and

284
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,880
that just goes right out the window when

285
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,500
you and again looking at this from a

286
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,760
media perspective I know which is

287
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,260
terrible considering that we people here

288
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,399
who know a lot more than the media ever

289
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
would but you know normally the first

290
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,540
question we would ask if there's a

291
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,540
breach is well what's been taken

292
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,720
and 99 times out of 10 our 100 even

293
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,839
there's good amounts 99 times out of 100

294
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,000
uh we'll go we don't know yet

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
um is that the biggest problem that you

296
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,440
face when when you have been caught by

297
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,060
the lion and you're at the the slowest

298
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,100
moving gazelle I mean that's a big

299
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,019
problem and it is 99 out of 10. it's

300
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,360
definitely 99.

301
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,959
um but yeah I mean very very rarely and

302
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,899
less unless the victim system is your

303
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,260
sap system or it's your financial system

304
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,820
you don't know so the question is okay

305
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
it's going back to you okay who owns the

306
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,380
system where is it what data is on it

307
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,480
and that's rarely ever documented so

308
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
yeah it's it's kind of going back after

309
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,720
the fact of finding out what's what's on

310
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,540
it you mentioned Jonathan the idea about

311
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,480
the uh the two-step notification on the

312
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,339
phone pinging and we all know how Bloody

313
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,959
annoying that is there's one system that

314
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,240
I have to log in every single time with

315
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,220
three-step authentication which drives

316
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,320
me crazy but it's there for a reason

317
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,240
Jenny one of the things I want to talk

318
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,180
to you about secure access okay because

319
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,519
when you introduce systems and try to

320
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,600
have like first of all Define secure and

321
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,360
when does secure become annoying to the

322
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,980
point of which it excludes employees

323
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,019
it's all about the balance right so like

324
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,700
talk about the access like we all know

325
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,079
that the attack services are growing

326
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,019
right between internet of things like

327
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,820
bring your own devices even physical

328
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,140
security all these kind of things like

329
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,480
if you look back in the threat reports

330
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,100
um hospitals are getting hit a lot of

331
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,540
manufacturing is getting hit a lot again

332
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,399
lots of voting environments so I think

333
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,660
you really need to lock down your access

334
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,120
especially privileged access do you know

335
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,620
who has access to all your domain and

336
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,779
bins are your service accounts locked

337
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,519
down have you got auditing turned on

338
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,959
like do you know who's doing what and

339
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,000
when they're doing it and I think as

340
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,620
well Asset Management so if you don't

341
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,060
know what you have how can you protect

342
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,459
it and again you have to take that the

343
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,019
growing attack surface into it into

344
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,820
account there as well and I think

345
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,500
there's there are a lot of things that

346
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,600
need to be considered and locked down

347
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,700
you need to take a step back and kind of

348
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,160
get above the weeds to kind of look as

349
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,660
the whole picture comes together and

350
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,640
then again like if it's all well and

351
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,260
good putting your access in but if no

352
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,640
one's actually monitoring the access so

353
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
are they doing periodic reviews you know

354
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,360
can you stand over your application list

355
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
and say are worse again have the team

356
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,940
found a way around it that's it yeah you

357
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,740
know it's the equivalent of years ago

358
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,260
will you will you clock me out there

359
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,459
because I've gone to the pub an hour

360
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,079
early you know is there is there

361
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,860
something that's happening that's

362
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,779
allowing that to happen that allows the

363
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,920
security system to fall down because

364
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
again it's time to people exactly and I

365
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,459
think MFA as well I think we're kind of

366
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,079
using MFA as a crotch a little bit we

367
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,339
think it's infallible we think it's

368
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,920
great the hackers know this and I was

369
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,880
actually listening to a threat report

370
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,380
the other day and they're like they're

371
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,060
gonna move their focus on that you know

372
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,200
that kind of way I think the Defenders

373
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,240
have kind of got a little bit ahead and

374
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
the attackers now are going to come and

375
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,640
they're going to hit as hard so you've

376
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
got your man in the middle attacks do

377
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,420
you know as like the just press the

378
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,579
button Make It Stop beefing at me so I

379
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,320
don't think MFA is the full answer like

380
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,899
it's it's a help but it's again just my

381
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:43,980
own personal experience last year and

382
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,760
it's something that didn't happen

383
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,100
previously was we somebody tried to

384
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,540
Target our bank account our company bank

385
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,720
account and it was so well done yeah it

386
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
was blinding there was a text there was

387
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,459
a follow-up phone call there was another

388
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,700
attempt to multi-factor authentication

389
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,500
thankfully my wife uh was on top of it

390
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,899
and didn't fall for but if she hadn't

391
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,100
been paying attention at that moment in

392
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,120
time she would have thought it was a

393
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,860
genuine so they're getting better at it

394
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,360
at getting around it and they're just

395
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,399
okay just zero trust as well right so

396
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,260
like it seems like a great idea you need

397
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,339
to find the balance between

398
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,440
operatability and security if you're

399
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,060
trying to do your day-to-day job and you

400
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,200
keep getting stopped to put in security

401
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,019
codes like who wants to do that do you

402
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,700
know what I mean yeah Jonathan one of

403
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,019
the things that got praying in my mind

404
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,240
with the HSE attack was that there was

405
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,360
some someone in I think was Beaumont

406
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,700
Hospital was being kind of pointed out

407
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,940
to go it was you you you you did it you

408
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,220
brought down the entire HSE system as if

409
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,500
it was somehow this individual's fault

410
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,420
when of course it wasn't it was a

411
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,820
systemoid failure and and it was but

412
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,139
ultimately some something that they

413
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:46,860
probably should have dealt with

414
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,240
differently which we'll talk about in a

415
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,500
later panel

416
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,240
um it puts people under immense pressure

417
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,700
doesn't it when something goes wrong

418
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
how do we how do we prevent that

419
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,079
pressure from becoming crushing so I

420
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,880
think it's you know I think I think you

421
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,459
make the really really compelling State

422
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,339
um it is a very stressful environment

423
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,959
um and you'll find that your recovery

424
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,720
teams unless you've done a lot of these

425
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,000
things in in real life or you've

426
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,579
practiced them extraordinarily well the

427
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,560
team won't react the way that you think

428
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,300
it will react and some of the people

429
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,560
that you might have thought you were

430
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
able to rely on

431
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,420
crumbled and other people you know

432
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,779
really rise up to it but I also you also

433
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,260
you have to be aware of what the other

434
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,700
organization's perception or the rest of

435
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,620
your organization's perception is so I

436
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,720
know of an example of a recovery team

437
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
that were 48 hours into

438
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,699
preventing the the same Cyber attack as

439
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,579
the the pingy thing that I mentioned and

440
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,120
that's a wonderful technical term

441
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,519
the finance department rejected their

442
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,220
claim for 48 pounds of pizza

443
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,740
right and the expenses because they

444
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,180
couldn't see the justification for it

445
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,660
right that killed the morale in that

446
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,820
recovery team right there because

447
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,800
someone in the rest of the organization

448
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
has not realized the lived experience of

449
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,839
what that team has gone through and all

450
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
they wanted was a bit of pizza right so

451
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,820
it's not just it's not just the exact

452
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,220
it's not just the team but it's also how

453
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,220
the whole organization needs to be aware

454
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,680
of what is going on because even if

455
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,240
we've done a really good job right and

456
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,279
we've limited that blast radius down to

457
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,680
a small thing right we've done the

458
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,579
compartmentalization the micro

459
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,740
segmentation all of that worked right

460
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,220
the organization needs to have a good

461
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,839
deal of awareness about what was

462
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,880
happening and how close

463
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,160
we came and what you know how successful

464
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,320
we were apart from in that one small

465
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,779
area if if you look at it in in that

466
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,199
context Andrew like you think of

467
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,760
catastrophic failure in any business so

468
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,820
if you are a factory that goes up in

469
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,740
flames you don't have a factory anymore

470
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,699
if you are a business uh where there is

471
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,380
a lot of risk of Machinery

472
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,820
um you know you have to make sure all

473
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,139
your staff are trained in health and

474
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,519
safety so that they don't get caught in

475
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,139
like you know the idea their jumper

476
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,420
getting cut and something turning and we

477
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,100
put so much effort into health and

478
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,920
safety we put so much effort into making

479
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,899
sure that the factory doesn't burn down

480
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,660
but because people still think it's

481
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,339
teenagers uh sitting in a basement

482
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,620
somewhere in Eastern Europe who might or

483
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,060
might not get into your system people

484
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,040
don't address the same risk as they

485
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,779
would about the burner the burning

486
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,180
Factory or the idea that you might you

487
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,620
know die as a result of getting Carter

488
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,199
Machinery why is that first of all and

489
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,940
how do we change that

490
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
I think it comes down to the risk

491
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,560
profile and not uh not understanding

492
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,540
kind of you kind of when we look at all

493
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,100
of the architectures and Frameworks are

494
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,420
out there about risk profile people

495
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,279
because it hasn't happened to them they

496
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,540
always think well that hasn't happened

497
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,220
so therefore it's someone else's problem

498
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,139
I don't need to take it on board there's

499
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,519
a budget constraint even Michael said

500
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,220
earlier on is budgets are a huge huge

501
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,959
thing a huge thing and it goes down that

502
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,579
kind of that level of kind of budget

503
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,740
constraints there but organizations who

504
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,319
do take it seriously do bring it on

505
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,240
board you know as you know generally it

506
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
happens afternoon event they'll take it

507
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,000
seriously they'll bring it on Board and

508
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,260
they'll they'll they'll be able to say

509
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,819
right we need to have technology Stacks

510
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,919
in place that can recognize what our

511
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,480
risk is out there what the assets we

512
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,199
have

513
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,880
what would go wrong when all these

514
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,679
assets either blow up or you know kind

515
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,419
of they go offline or you know for

516
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,400
whatever reason they may go

517
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,900
to understand what that the young and

518
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,299
how that how those have come together

519
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:28,980
and once you get to that point they go

520
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,780
oh okay if that goes lots of Revenue

521
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,460
here potentially loss of life if it's

522
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,200
Healthcare you know kind of or you know

523
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
kind of a loss of business reputation

524
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,380
which is more than anything else if you

525
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,700
get to the banking financial industry

526
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,500
reputation is everything money is is

527
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,720
kind of irrelevant in in that scenario

528
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
so you have to kind of say see what the

529
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520
risks are and build up towards how

530
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,660
you're going to do it and technology is

531
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,700
a as a big enabler in doing that is

532
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,020
showing them what their assets are

533
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,640
showing them what the risks are showing

534
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,380
the criticality of what those risks of

535
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,059
the assets and what they can do just to

536
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,080
finish up with this panel if we can

537
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,380
about 30 seconds each uh if you get to

538
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,760
that 2 A.M moment what's the most

539
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,960
important thing you do to build

540
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,600
resilience into your system Michael

541
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
to build resilience into that system

542
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,059
well honestly I'm going to take a step

543
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,400
back before 2 A.M because I think the

544
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,960
first step towards recovery is admitting

545
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,340
you've got a problem I think too many

546
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,020
companies out there aren't admitting

547
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,020
they have a problem and therefore you've

548
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,320
got old systems on the network unpatched

549
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,059
systems until the business comes along

550
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,919
and you know you have to explain it to

551
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,559
them like this is the risk until they

552
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,120
acknowledge oh yeah we do have a problem

553
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,799
we need to actually come up with a plan

554
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,020
then you can start to talk about how to

555
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,299
how to add resilience into into your

556
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,539
system okay um lovely uh Jenny I think

557
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,280
if you fail to prepare you're preparing

558
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,160
to fail Roy Keane said that I know right

559
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
yeah but it is very very true if you

560
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,220
don't have the right plans in if you

561
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,720
don't have that accountability piece

562
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,100
maybe if you've done a couple of

563
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,600
tabletop exercise you can run people

564
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,640
through the steps you need to know

565
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
what's happening and in an event like

566
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,700
that people will not be thinking clearly

567
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,980
especially not at 2 A.M yep Jonathan any

568
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,360
footballing quotes are Australian no

569
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,580
we'll just stick with the practice right

570
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,280
practice practice practice and don't

571
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,820
just practice in a tabletop because

572
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,580
everyone has a bias to optimism right in

573
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,200
these things oh yeah yeah we'll do a

574
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,179
restore right okay that's all fine yeah

575
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,100
how long does that take oh it takes two

576
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,440
hours perfect good right okay it's two

577
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,880
hours later yep everything's restored

578
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,240
perfect let's go right reality

579
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,100
when you're doing a restores is never

580
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,480
like that right because you haven't got

581
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
a dependency that you've you've missed

582
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,220
or something right so you need to not do

583
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,660
tabletops absolutely but do it for real

584
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,700
very good and lastly if we turn to you

585
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,539
Andrew

586
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,220
I would agree with everyone there I'll

587
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,840
also say it's understanding all the

588
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,460
assets understanding the change in your

589
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,620
assets because no organization is static

590
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,080
so when you do your exercises and then

591
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,580
something changes you you add a new

592
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,039
asset in or a new entity into it or a

593
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,380
new service what do you do with that how

594
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,580
can that change because if you get that

595
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,140
2AM and you've got something over on the

596
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,460
side which is critical to the business

597
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,380
that nobody knows about that's still

598
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,240
potentially going to be down after that

599
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,520
two hours so it has to be continuous

600
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
constantly looking at these things to

601
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,520
make sure we know it's there well long

602
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,980
may you not get a 2AM call uh r d Daddy

603
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,179
went in this room but for now Michael

604
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,220
Clark Jenny Parry Andrew Noonan and
