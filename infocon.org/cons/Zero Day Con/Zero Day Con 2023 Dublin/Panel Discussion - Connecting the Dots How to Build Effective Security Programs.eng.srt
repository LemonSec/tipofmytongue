1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:10,160
[Music]

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,620
um just for the benefits of the people

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,500
who are with us here and might know who

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,760
each of you are oh and I'm going to

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,080
begin with you maybe if you could just

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,359
give us the 30 second version of what

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,619
you do

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,240
oh

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,140
sorry you're gonna have to say that

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,900
again I was talking to you yeah you were

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,880
complimenting him on on The Gazette I

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,679
was yeah um tell us a little bit about

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
what you do in the in your organization

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
yeah so my name is Owen Fleming I'm the

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,579
CIO of the current Group which is a fund

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,920
uh uh essentially what's called a

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,860
Superman Co which has one trillion uh in

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,399
in management and I'm a former Caesar

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,079
um

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,200
recovering csos so I decided

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,660
um so it was a season for about 10 years

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,239
and and the reason I moved again into

23
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,739
the CIO world because there's a lot of

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,120
crossover as deep mom will tell you

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,559
because he's both

26
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,440
um between the world of the CIO and the

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,740
world of isizo the main difference is as

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,240
a ceso you're always looking for money

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,939
as a CIO you're always the one saying no

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,280
or rather the CFO is the one saying no

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,960
so I decided to uh be the one who for

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,700
once isn't isn't the guy looking for

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
money necessarily he's the guy saying no

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,979
because you know that's it's a bit of a

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,600
break from being a season

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
okay fair enough for that whatever

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,560
floats your boat as they say um Sarah do

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,340
you want to tell us what you do with

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,439
Salesforce sure yeah I'm a director in

40
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,600
the security uh or within the identity

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,939
and access management space and so work

42
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,740
around compliance and access control

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,439
governance and so work a lot with audit

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,040
risk and and that kind of okay and a big

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,420
organization I mean how many companies

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
sales force a global organization how

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,299
many authors how many countries have you

48
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,700
got operations in oh all over the globe

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,159
yeah yeah I have um teams at the moment

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,920
in the US and India and Ireland and

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,860
Italy as well so okay it's a broad so in

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,119
other words you don't deal with the

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,159
local challenge you deal with a global

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,600
challenge did Mark we heard a little bit

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,060
from you um Paul if we can just talk to

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,139
you a little bit about checkpoint and

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,599
what you do yeah sure thanks for having

58
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,500
us

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,540
um so I'm responsible for some of our

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,140
largest uh complex uh accounts that's

61
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,700
everything from design deployment run of

62
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,379
our technology everything from

63
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,420
traditional network security all the way

64
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,459
through through to uh to end point so

65
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,860
lots of visibility into the challenges

66
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,060
cool

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,260
um I'm going to talk about I've got to

68
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,540
pick up something that Chris mentioned

69
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,520
um first of all to you on he talked

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,280
about swarms of distraction which is a

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,980
wonderful way of describing it and and

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,519
everybody who's in uh that space there's

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,260
constantly swarms and you're dealing

74
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,640
with what's in front of you as opposed

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,920
to dealing with perhaps what might come

76
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,379
in six months time or a more global view

77
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,080
how do you prevent yourself from being

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,060
distracted by those swarms because

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,620
they're constant in the current

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,879
environment

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,099
the the biggest challenge that you face

82
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,920
in in it generally and it's it's even

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,099
more true as a Caesar or a CIO is

84
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,019
what is strategic model is tactical

85
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,580
right

86
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,000
um you will always have issues come up

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
10 times a day right

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,459
um the the most important thing is and

89
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,440
it was said by an earlier speaker you

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
focus the the Eisenhower box is is

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,540
actually an amazing tool right and I

92
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,980
teach you to everybody I work with right

93
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,879
if only we had seen this Chris

94
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,860
come on it's urgent important do

95
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,900
delegate right that's that's what it is

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
in a nutshell right and there are things

97
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,640
that you need to deal with personally

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,379
those are the two things there are

99
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,819
things that you need to give to your

100
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,500
team or to give to somebody else they're

101
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,080
the delegate things right you have to

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,540
keep the end goal in mind otherwise you

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,940
will never get there the NCIS folks said

104
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,299
that that's you know it's in every it's

105
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,159
in every seal book you'll ever read it's

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,720
in every success book you'll ever read

107
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,159
it's in every self-help book you'll ever

108
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,440
read and but if you don't know where

109
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,519
you're going

110
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,739
then you you will deal with tactical

111
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,060
stuff all the time because you don't

112
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,799
have an end goal in mind it's that

113
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,380
simple Sarah when an organization is

114
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,380
putting cyber Security Programs together

115
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,418
they normally tend to address the issues

116
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,280
that we know about now but the one thing

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,300
that I've learned from doing this

118
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,919
conference over the years is what we

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,020
know now isn't what we're going to know

120
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,600
in six months are 12 months time so how

121
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,160
important is it that you're able to

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,400
adapt those plans but also have a an eye

123
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,860
on that end goal which is to keep your

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,680
data secure at all costs yeah exactly I

125
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,419
mean it needs to be flexible as well I

126
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,940
think the the plan and it needs to be

127
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,639
kind of well tested and rounded to kind

128
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,440
of cover you know the operational

129
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,960
aspects of the organization and all

130
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,180
areas kind of from end to end

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,560
someone you really need to understand

132
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,080
the kind of operational flow

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,340
um and the processes within the

134
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
organization have you know all the

135
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,060
stakeholders on board from across the

136
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,800
organization to ensure that you've kind

137
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,320
of got that buy-in and ownership as well

138
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,259
how do you manage it with

139
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,979
multi-jurisdiction so in other words you

140
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,419
listed off the countries there you have

141
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,500
colleagues working with you in

142
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,600
Salesforce not all of them have English

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,639
as their first language and

144
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,860
Communications barriers will always be

145
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,780
thrown up from time to time you need to

146
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,759
get that buy-in from people at the

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,560
ground level otherwise it doesn't work

148
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,180
so how do you overcome that particular

149
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,440
challenge though so that the foot

150
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,380
soldiers in this defense at least know

151
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,460
what they're doing

152
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,139
yeah I think somebody mentioned earlier

153
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,940
on communication um and you know

154
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,100
obviously awareness and training and

155
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,560
security uh security training has to be

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,699
you know prevalented within the

157
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,039
organization and you know courses online

158
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,780
courses you know signing off to say that

159
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,820
you've kind of you've done that and

160
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,500
those types of learnings that are

161
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,539
required you know around regulation and

162
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,220
compliance as well that are obviously

163
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,500
very important and that needs to be

164
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,900
definitely part of your security program

165
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,139
if we were to talk deepmar about Annie

166
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,479
of the cyber security breaches that have

167
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,460
garnered headlines in recent times any

168
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,500
organization I mean most recently you

169
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,479
had Virgin Media in this country had

170
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,860
some of their channels taken off air

171
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,680
you'd MTU and cork which were the

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,060
university and their entire system was

173
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,259
locked down for weeks they're still

174
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,820
rebuilding it now

175
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,800
you don't know that you're the slowest

176
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,479
gazelle until the teeth are actually

177
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,380
sinking into your back so how do you how

178
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,000
do you get past that how do you get to

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,400
the point at which you're the porcupine

180
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,819
I mean one thing is and and and we heard

181
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,380
some confirmation you have to have a

182
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,080
talk uh you have to have a a Target

183
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,500
which you try to achieve and

184
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
um to explain to you people and this is

185
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,539
what you also confirmed you have to have

186
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,479
regular training so by training them you

187
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,720
you more or less standardize the

188
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,940
understanding what is the target when we

189
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,280
talk about compliance security risks

190
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,800
what do we mean by that and by the

191
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,319
standardization and we heard it also in

192
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,500
the in the NCIS speech you have this

193
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
this kind of same language and by that

194
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,139
the same understanding of what has to be

195
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,960
achieved and if you can transport this

196
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,479
one over into the board that even you're

197
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,400
getting confirmation and understanding

198
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,560
from the board what is the target we are

199
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,180
trying to achieve and they're the

200
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,979
standards if you have a missed standard

201
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,800
or CIS standard to help you and that's

202
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,479
also the bridge how you can transport

203
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,880
the understanding from Attack mental

204
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,340
world into a non-technical world nicely

205
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,020
I just want to check just for a quick

206
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,099
show of hands in the room here because

207
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,060
we've got a lot of people who are

208
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,220
involved in cyber security who here can

209
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,840
honestly say that everybody within their

210
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,699
organization is fully aware of the risks

211
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,160
that they face on a day-to-day basis

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,319
from external forces show of hands

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,520
anyone who says that they can stand over

214
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,919
everybody in their business

215
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
not one of you which is true who here

216
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,740
thinks that they have done as much as

217
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,660
they can do to make their colleagues

218
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,319
aware of the risk

219
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,160
can I just check that your hands are

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
working uh if you can just baby just

221
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,819
show me that everyone put up their left

222
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,080
hand

223
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,639
okay their hands are working right but

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,199
that just goes to show you the the

225
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,720
challenge that is out there it's it's I

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
mean is that a trusting dietmar is that

227
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,580
uh an acceptance of reality that human

228
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,840
Frailty

229
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,060
is the Cyber criminal's biggest

230
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,240
Advantage I mean we heard it in the

231
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
speeches it's a people business and the

232
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,300
the most uh let's say prominent attack

233
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,200
factors uh vectors are using users in

234
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,559
the company and it's like a game and and

235
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,740
you cannot really let's say resolve this

236
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,179
because there's it's a constant

237
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,799
development so you're forced to

238
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,140
constantly train your people you have

239
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,540
constantly to review your measures

240
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,300
update the measures there is a constant

241
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,399
change in the organization and

242
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,839
everything what is changing in the

243
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,820
organization you have to review you have

244
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,279
to adjust your measures in security so

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,560
it's a permanent game and it's more a

246
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,260
marathon and there is never an end so

247
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,120
it's a daily challenge which you have to

248
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,100
which you have to overcome and this is

249
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,200
why all the measures which we heard

250
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
today is not a single event it's more or

251
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,720
less a repetition a long-term repetition

252
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,360
and you have to have the let's say a

253
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,060
breast to do this on a daily basis Paul

254
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,620
if I can talk to you about getting that

255
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,600
balance right so obviously you guys are

256
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,160
involved in every stage in that process

257
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,660
you've got people you've processes

258
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,220
you've Technologies you're building out

259
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,380
Security Programs there has to be buy-in

260
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,060
from everybody in the chain from the

261
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,220
person at the bottom to the person at

262
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,680
the top how do you achieve a balance

263
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,880
there that isn't a disruptive to the

264
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,640
actual job that you're trying to do B is

265
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,620
secure and robust enough that people

266
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,300
know what they're doing and I suppose

267
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,700
ultimately keeps your data safe even if

268
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,440
somebody does manage to get through that

269
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,620
first level of security yeah and it's a

270
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,839
good good question I think I I changed

271
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,380
the word how to can we can we get that

272
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,440
balance uh right because if you go back

273
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,320
to deep Mars analogy of the house I

274
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,760
think most big complex all organizations

275
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,800
would probably agree there is a house

276
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,480
I think that's probably where the

277
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,420
agreement ends as to how many rooms

278
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,519
what's in the rooms

279
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,040
if you go back to Frameworks we we heard

280
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,540
Chris and we've heard dimar talk about

281
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,640
Frameworks and standards and

282
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,380
methodologies

283
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,580
nist CIS there's there's hundreds

284
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,820
um problem is it does Drive compliance

285
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,339
and I think everyone realizes compliance

286
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,860
as human beings most humans love to be

287
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,260
compliant they love a tick in a box you

288
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,019
did a good job you've done it well done

289
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,120
the challenge is you're running a change

290
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,360
program and most humans either are

291
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
afraid of or resist change so you end up

292
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,760
with a great deal of Chaos

293
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,680
and if you use a framework as a good

294
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,079
example nist talks about the first phase

295
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,640
of identify

296
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,880
most organizations still today cannot

297
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
reliably

298
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,680
Define what is in their infrastructure

299
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,300
so if you can't at the beginning of the

300
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,220
organization that is the more difficult

301
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,040
it is to Define it's hugely difficult I

302
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,740
think it's incredibly easily said it's

303
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,320
phenomenally difficult to deliver so you

304
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,540
end up with different tools different

305
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,339
vendors telling you they can go and

306
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,860
discover they can aggregate they can

307
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,079
give you risk management Frameworks they

308
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,360
can do everything the problem is they

309
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
can't

310
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,240
and we come back to the people aspect

311
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,040
again which has been mentioned a number

312
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,560
of times the reality in the industry is

313
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,740
in I.T specifically people and Talon has

314
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,320
been incredibly under invested for many

315
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,399
years

316
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,160
skills have not accelerated and

317
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,680
developed at the rate of technology so

318
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,660
we have a Workforce that isn't

319
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,720
necessarily adequately prepared to

320
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,300
either deal with the thousands of

321
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,360
actions to remediate infrastructure nor

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,399
are they capable of keeping up with the

323
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,860
pace of change so you come back to your

324
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,040
question and I say back to the idea of

325
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,140
focus

326
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,100
Eisenhower's quadrant

327
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,899
you know getting visibility

328
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,240
understanding where critical assets are

329
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,240
having a risk register to go and really

330
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,320
tick off those absolutely you know

331
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,300
impacting events they that that is the

332
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,360
key so balance no Focus

333
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,820
small steps progress not Perfection yes

334
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,640
on when it comes to okay we're talking

335
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,140
about the people down on the Chain right

336
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,240
let's go back to the top of the tree

337
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
um and I'm on boards people here are on

338
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,980
boards boards consist of people with

339
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,060
various different levels of

340
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,800
understanding um and that's where

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
communication is really important so

342
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
that the people who are on that board

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,540
know exactly what you're talking about

344
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,760
nobody wants to be the chairman get in

345
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
the car to say you'll never guess what

346
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,720
happened ah and then have to turn around

347
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,399
after it's gone and say well why didn't

348
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,720
you tell me that this was a risk so

349
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
getting buy-in at that high level it's

350
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,160
it's more important in the bigger

351
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,899
organizations I'm presuming than it

352
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,300
would be if you've got a smaller

353
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,680
operation where things can be done more

354
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
agilely and quick

355
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,700
yeah I mean the the in a small

356
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,139
organization

357
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,600
the board are a nebulous concept you

358
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,760
will meet them all right and they beat

359
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,139
them on the left you meet them in the

360
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,880
lift you meet them in the lobby you have

361
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,279
time with them in a big organization you

362
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,860
will get if you're lucky an hour

363
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,279
probably a quarter with them right so

364
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,839
you better be sure to make an impact in

365
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,760
that error and and I mean the right kind

366
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
of impact

367
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,420
um good advice I can give you bring two

368
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,139
decks bring the crayon deck which is

369
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,339
non-technical I'd like to point out I'm

370
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,380
a huge fan of the crayon deck as

371
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,820
somebody who doesn't quite get it but

372
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,480
yeah the the remember that the CFO does

373
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,700
not understand I.T he understands

374
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,079
balance sheets right uh you're you're

375
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,040
the rest of the organization has

376
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
specific focuses very few of them at

377
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
board level will be on I.T they're

378
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
generalists typically at board level

379
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,700
with very deep sectoral expertise in one

380
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,160
area and that area is not it and you

381
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,620
better bet it's not security all right

382
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,300
um there are very few board members with

383
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,920
a security background

384
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,600
um accepting technology companies that

385
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,920
would be the one exception that you

386
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,959
would see commonly enough

387
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,600
bring in the crayon deck try the crayon

388
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,700
deck right which is this is what we're

389
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,920
trying to do this is why we're trying to

390
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,660
do it these are the key risks you're

391
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,240
exposed to and leave it there you will

392
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,639
get 15 minutes to make your point you'll

393
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,139
be stopped after five minutes if they're

394
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,300
not getting it all right the most

395
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,399
important thing is have the scalpel deck

396
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,740
as well right because from personal

397
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,079
experience you walk in you start the

398
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,660
crayon deck this is how it is these are

399
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,880
the risks and you find that you've

400
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,199
actually misjudged because you don't

401
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,480
know the board first message know the

402
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,240
board second thing know what they focus

403
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,120
on third thing don't walk in blind

404
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,100
because you'll have somebody stop you in

405
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,240
the middle of the presentation and going

406
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,579
yeah that's great but what are you

407
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,980
actually doing right that's where you

408
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,180
have the scalpel deck in the background

409
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,399
these are the metrics this is the

410
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,079
management people process technology

411
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,480
this is how we're doing everything

412
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,160
if you have those two decks you'll

413
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,800
survive the experience right and it'll

414
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,600
be safer for you but you will get

415
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,540
probably 15 minutes in total but you get

416
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,040
five minutes to make that impression

417
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,320
Sarah how important is it that that you

418
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
I mean in many ways with a board members

419
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,260
at an extremely senior Executives of big

420
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,760
organizations you have to scare the

421
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,500
Daylights out in some ways don't you you

422
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,019
have to kind of show them this could all

423
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,320
be gone tomorrow unless we put proper

424
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,600
procedures and practices in place I mean

425
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
take our own HSE example here they shut

426
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,959
down the entire Public Health Service in

427
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,360
a heartbeat that had to be rebuilt from

428
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,120
scratch casting Millions upon millions

429
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,399
of Euro I mean that board if they ate

430
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,720
their time back would have would have

431
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,220
listened to a lot more key risk

432
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,980
indicators so do you have to go nuclear

433
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,380
or do you bring them along with you on a

434
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,060
more subtle Journey yeah I would say

435
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,800
that you would have to emphasize you

436
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,420
know where the threats are I mean I

437
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,680
think that's what they want to see they

438
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,420
want to see you know the most important

439
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,940
risk and how it's going to affect the

440
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,920
organization meeting their objectives

441
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,560
and how important it is to them and the

442
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,540
organization's goals and that has to you

443
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,279
know be kind of obvious as well to them

444
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,959
when you're showing you know Kris and

445
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,300
that to the board and but yeah

446
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,100
absolutely I think there needs to be a

447
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,779
little bit of that you know if this

448
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,459
doesn't change or if this isn't actioned

449
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,079
then it's going to have you know

450
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,240
detrimental effect on whatever the

451
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,860
organization's goals are and I think

452
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,720
even with you know the Kris they should

453
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,300
kind of be based around you know aspects

454
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,380
that are very important to the business

455
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,079
so for example if it's data

456
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,399
um you know that that's very important

457
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,779
customer data then you know maybe

458
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,000
something like Kris around that

459
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
um or if it's high availability systems

460
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,019
you know to to have some kind of a kri

461
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,500
around that do they care at board level

462
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,540
more about reputation when it comes to

463
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,160
data breach than they do about financial

464
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,559
loss it should be I think you know Broad

465
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,000
and I think as I mentioned people

466
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,799
process technology they should

467
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,900
definitely be I think as diverse as

468
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,900
turnover and stuff to a number of

469
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,939
growing threats and so I think it should

470
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,880
cover you know all those aspects and

471
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,619
deepmar the the challenge of course is

472
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,119
is bringing them with you then so I mean

473
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,799
it's all very well going in and setting

474
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,380
it out but uh anyone who sits on boards

475
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,460
will know well that was a lovely

476
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,260
presentation now what's next and they

477
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,640
move on to some other things so how do

478
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,200
you bring them with you on the journey

479
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,840
so that you see so your CIO get the

480
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,880
tools that they need to protect the

481
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,940
organization I mean what we did in the

482
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,160
last 12 months is we learned that

483
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
they're reacting on two things and I'm

484
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,799
doing nearly what you're doing but we're

485
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,320
showing them progress as they don't

486
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,640
understand what you're talking about

487
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,280
when you become too technical they're

488
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,919
really really caring do we progress in

489
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,600
the right direction so we have a spider

490
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,559
chart with the uh a 17 CIS criterias we

491
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
have a bench where we are we have a kind

492
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,299
of explanation where we should be and

493
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,580
then we show them on a regular base okay

494
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,679
these are the measures forget them you

495
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,299
don't understand this but this was how

496
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,940
we are developing the spider chart so we

497
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,980
show them progress and this is where

498
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,380
they see oh they're doing something we

499
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,940
don't understand it but it looks like

500
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,860
they're coming closer and closer to the

501
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,440
Target then you have to tell them hey

502
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,299
because you're changing the organization

503
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,120
we always have to review is the target

504
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,400
correct and some changes of the

505
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
organization might take you also

506
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
backwards so there is not only a forward

507
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,120
step it's also backwards that depending

508
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,860
on what you're doing and something what

509
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,020
we figured out and you brought this this

510
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,900
example which recently happened

511
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,120
they're reading newspapers so what we

512
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,039
are doing is we take out of the

513
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
newspapers before there is a board

514
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,220
meeting the most recent uh uh the most

515
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,500
recently somebody else yes it's all in

516
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,120
their mind and then we say

517
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,240
if this would happen to us how would we

518
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,059
be protected and where do we have holes

519
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,400
and this is something what I

520
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,980
surprisingly learned these guys started

521
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,780
to understand and we had in Switzerland

522
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,240
credits with somebody an ex-it guy

523
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,960
stolen salary data and I said okay if

524
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,600
you take this example this is the way

525
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,520
how you can steal data in our

526
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,620
organization and this is what we already

527
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,080
closed and these are the open things do

528
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,760
you agree that we should close the

529
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
remaining ones and I got Applause well

530
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,740
done and a high understanding and this

531
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,260
is so damn basic but it worked but it

532
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,179
worked and they saw what what well they

533
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,740
start questioning what would it mean to

534
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,559
us and more importantly would I get into

535
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,080
trouble if it went wrong and that is a

536
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,940
great motivator and Paul there's lots of

537
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,620
different solutions out there there's no

538
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,480
one solution on the shelf that you can

539
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,220
pull down and say that's Grand that

540
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,380
fixes all of our problems and so

541
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,700
therefore the next challenge you have

542
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,740
when you're trying to get people to

543
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,380
bounce them into this is is well we need

544
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,559
to spend money at Q absolutely appalling

545
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,020
look from someone who is there saying no

546
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,120
to you and and here's what we need to

547
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,760
spend money on so the next fight is well

548
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,160
can we do it with maybe half of that or

549
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,020
if you had two-thirds of that budget

550
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,059
what would we get how do you kind of get

551
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,500
them back to where they were applauding

552
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,320
dietmar yeah I'd love to have seen that

553
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,380
um no no I think to your point even

554
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,299
checkpoint doesn't have one technology

555
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,220
to fix all issues

556
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,320
um no no look you have to understand the

557
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,020
pressures in in any organization

558
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,740
um

559
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,960
to your point what can they afford the

560
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,340
reality is over the years many

561
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,220
organizations have spent the money

562
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,020
the challenge is they've not realized

563
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,020
the value from their spend you you go

564
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,120
look at any organization they will have

565
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,480
depending on size millions of dollars of

566
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,360
unused technology sat on shelves you

567
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,640
know not deployed not operational not

568
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,039
reducing risk in the organization which

569
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,780
brings you back to the idea of of the

570
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,480
risk register the risk register should

571
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,140
inform decisions you take to minimize

572
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,419
the greatest impact and threat to your

573
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:13,620
organization

574
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,840
so you should align that thinking that

575
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,299
rationale to the architecture you have

576
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,740
deployed the reality is it's it's

577
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,419
overused in in cyber terms but every

578
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:25,980
organization has many many different

579
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,240
tools

580
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,760
every organization wants to simplify and

581
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,299
consolidate these are known knowns the

582
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,740
challenge is

583
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,380
these change programs can take anywhere

584
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,539
between two to five years

585
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,179
to deploy this is not something you

586
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,539
decide and then happens overnight so an

587
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,280
understanding of the pressures in terms

588
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,860
of what have I spent what do I have

589
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,580
available to me to reduce risk where are

590
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,559
my architecturally in terms of technical

591
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,679
debt I cannot change quickly if I am a

592
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,900
legacy organization with technical debt

593
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,240
I can go quickly if I'm a newer

594
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,120
organization more agile more access to

595
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
Cloud infrastructure it's a bigger Yeah

596
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,840
the more slow moving you are as a beast

597
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,559
typically yes typically yes you you end

598
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,980
up almost

599
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,179
claustrophobic in in the environment

600
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,340
you've set you know I work with many

601
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,260
large Banks globally and we look at the

602
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,760
infrastructure we look at we've talked

603
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,200
about inventory management Asset

604
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,500
Management we've talked about the impact

605
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
of change and coming back full circle to

606
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,880
the question I think right now is the

607
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
most energy I've seen in simplification

608
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,679
programs

609
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,500
at any time in my career I think there's

610
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,620
finally a realization that the effort

611
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,020
required is worth the result well do you

612
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,220
know the reason why that is if it's

613
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,440
Banks is because half of the stuff that

614
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,760
comes out from cyber criminal is trying

615
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,620
to get you to log into their systems

616
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,600
look more sophisticated than the actual

617
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,240
Banks

618
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,919
which is a little bit of a killer um my

619
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,299
favorite question to ask anyone in this

620
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,100
space if they're a CIO or a CSO is

621
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,419
what's the thing that keeps you awake at

622
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,860
night right now Sarah what is it for you

623
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,979
um

624
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,440
I suppose there's you know lots of

625
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,020
different uh projects going on I suppose

626
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,760
at the moment that that kind of do keep

627
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,500
me awake at night

628
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,140
um I mean the the risks are kind of you

629
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,640
know they're broad at the moment there's

630
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,380
just a lot really you know to kind of

631
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,539
the small distractions as it was

632
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,220
described yeah from the geopolitical

633
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,740
risks you know to resourcing kind of

634
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,080
shortages you know all of all of those

635
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,720
things really kind of combined I guess

636
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
um I can't put my finger on kind of any

637
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,020
one thing you're just losing sleep in

638
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,659
general that's okay too for you uh is

639
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,280
there any one particular thing right now

640
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,580
it's fishing uh I saw I saw a an AI

641
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,179
generated voice uh uh so so people think

642
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,760
about you know kind of a impersonation

643
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
in terms of being video and and having

644
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,380
that kind of overlay the AI overlay but

645
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,500
actually a very simple voice uh but

646
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,299
basically it can make you sound like

647
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,159
anybody right so it was released the

648
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,600
other day right

649
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,000
um that's terrifying because most of our

650
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,340
business is done over the telephone the

651
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,919
traditional telephone not necessarily

652
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,620
um you know teams or that or or Zoom

653
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,140
um the challenge is we run quarterly

654
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,600
fishing exercises if you don't run

655
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,340
tests like that you never know what

656
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,559
what's out there right and we vary

657
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,360
between one percent when we do something

658
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,740
that's very unsophisticated and

659
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,179
basically says I'm a phishing attack

660
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,919
please report me

661
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,780
um and recently we ran one which by

662
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,039
accident was incredibly effective

663
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,900
because we by accident use the name of

664
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,940
somebody in the organization to to do

665
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,580
DocuSign targeted attack and we got four

666
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,799
percent but actually I've worked in

667
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,240
Banks all over the world and typically

668
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,860
you get somewhere between three percent

669
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,419
and seven percent of the organization

670
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,940
responding uh to that and giving their

671
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,520
credentials right a single person so in

672
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,220
a thousand person organization that's 70

673
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,980
or 80 people right a single person from

674
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,659
that will kill your whole company that's

675
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,720
what happened to the HSE right so

676
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,460
how do you combat that education

677
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,320
education education where is the problem

678
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,900
always at it's people it's always always

679
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,059
but it's going to be much harder if

680
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,679
you've got AI That's impersonating

681
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,659
somebody who they have recognize and

682
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,179
they get bounced into something which is

683
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,220
what which is why we didn't have badges

684
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,200
before but now we have mandatory badges

685
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,940
because what we do now is when we pick

686
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,100
up the phone to somebody on a video call

687
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,320
we ask them to hold up their badge right

688
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,760
so okay

689
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,500
that's uh that's kind of alarming in

690
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,460
many ways

691
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,159
Umar what's uh what's keeping you awake

692
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,320
um we did we did quite a lot of things

693
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,240
to improve

694
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,120
um but what is for me important is that

695
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,340
we also have the capability to react and

696
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,140
it was mentioned in a couple of speeches

697
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,440
and this is something where how do we

698
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
it sounds strange drill the organization

699
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,539
that in case of an attack we are

700
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,140
reacting correctly Speedy to First keep

701
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,419
the attack as small as possible but he

702
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,440
also stay operational and this is

703
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,720
something where you're getting arguments

704
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,940
like it's disrupting the business we

705
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,480
need to be operational uh uh we don't

706
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,340
have the time for it so there is where

707
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,440
the business is pushing back but if you

708
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,080
don't train your organization what can

709
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,900
happen and how to react you're always

710
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,740
passive and the impact will be much

711
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,940
bigger than you have a trained

712
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,640
organization and military training is

713
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,340
let's say on purpose if you don't train

714
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,860
your military forces you you're you're

715
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,260
alone you'd effectively fire doors that

716
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,640
should if a fire breaks out a fire door

717
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,080
comes down the Fire doesn't spread very

718
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,940
briefly if we can Paul last to you

719
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,679
what's the big threat that you see right

720
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,799
now no so at checkpoint what what

721
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,440
worries is consists consistently is uh

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,919
half finished projects so we are part of

723
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,159
a supply chain in cyber and we often see

724
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,320
these half finished projects that the

725
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,260
collateral damage tarnishes vendor

726
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,900
reputations and It ultimately does not

727
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,299
reduce the risk that was required okay

728
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,440
and I'm guessing there's a lot of

729
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,299
finished projects out there I given how

730
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,380
quickly things move it's been

731
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,520
fascinating to talk to Joe thank you so

732
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
