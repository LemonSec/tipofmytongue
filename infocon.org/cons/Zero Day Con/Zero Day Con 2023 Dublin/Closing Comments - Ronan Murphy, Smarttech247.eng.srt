[Music]

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,440
so guys I guess to wrap up uh first and

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,200
foremost I'd like to sincerely thank

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,639
everybody in the smart Tech team that

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,960
made today happen

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,760
um huge amount of effort went into it

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,560
and obviously our sponsors

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,000
um well I think one of the big takeaways

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,859
I personally took from this is over the

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,980
years we've had uh these conferences and

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,720
we've had vendors who've stood up on

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,939
stage and they've tried to Proclaim that

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,560
they had a silver bullet to fix all of

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,540
the cyber security problems of the world

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,700
whereas today was very different you had

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,320
a lot of taught leadership under stage a

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,480
lot of people talk about the the wide

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,340
and diverse nature of the challenges

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,140
which they're facing and the type of

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,940
methodologies that need to be applied to

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,340
try and deal with these challenges uh in

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,980
particular I thought that um Christopher

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,960
from the NCIS an awful lot of what he

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,180
talked about was absolutely on point and

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,100
it's something that resonates a lot in

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,660
my own mind and it's something that

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,699
probably Keeps Us awake at night in

28
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,520
smart Tech is that a lot of

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,899
organizations like to be able to

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,400
demonstrate that they take the box from

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,920
a compliance perspective but

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
demonstrating compliance and actually

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,580
being secure are two very different

34
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,380
things so the type of action that's

35
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,180
needed around that

36
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,920
um I I found some of the conversations

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,320
around it around AI were particularly

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,060
interesting obviously the world is on

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,580
fire with Chachi Beauty And The

40
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,380
Innovation that's happening there and

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,659
and Brilliant Technologies coming out

42
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,759
like get visibility and other tools that

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,040
are utilizing Ai and ml to deal with

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,420
these problems but then on the other

45
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,579
side obviously there's the potential to

46
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,560
use those Technologies to attack

47
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
organizations and that's something that

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,100
we need to be aware of

49
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,680
um reluka opened up talking about the

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,960
geopolitical tensions in the world

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,680
um and uh you know not trying to to

52
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,479
embellish this but I'm under No Illusion

53
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,320
whatsoever that cyberspace is in a in a

54
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,180
cyber War right now at an operational

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,640
level and I think it's an unprecedented

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,920
levels and the guys in the FBA and CIS

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
probably even downplayed it in my mind

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,939
because the level of attacks that are

59
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,160
going unannounced to the media globally

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,879
is uh really profoundly scary

61
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,580
um but in Katie in Irish waterspoke

62
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,800
really well about threat modeling about

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,840
how you prepare for what's coming down

64
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,060
the line and um I'm not sure if everyone

65
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,640
knew what the what the uh did the

66
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,840
Americans were talking about when they

67
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,720
kept saying left of Boom so um so I'm so

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm sure some regardless of some people

69
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,379
may not have but effectively what that

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,680
is is the timeline right between

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,300
pre-breach boom is the breach and then

72
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,980
what happens afterwards right and it's a

73
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,660
br it's a brilliant

74
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,040
um concept because if you think about

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,959
the anatomy of a Cyber attack or what

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,660
happened with the HSE and while we loved

77
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,220
said you know a huge amount of happened

78
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,379
by a sophisticated exploit of a

79
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,000
vulnerability intrude most of what

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,019
happens because someone clicks on an

81
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,400
email to get access and then a guy like

82
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,660
Eddie gets all your computer and you're

83
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
dead he navigates away his way around

84
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,959
the network they find the data they

85
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,000
exfiltrate it and they encrypt you and

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
that's the reality of what happens but

87
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
when you talk about left of Boom it's

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
about ensuring that uh when the doors

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
guys get access when that person clicks

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,739
on the email making sure that you've got

91
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,959
the right controls the right procedures

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
in place to deal with it effectively and

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
then if you're unfortunate and boom does

94
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,780
happen then what does right of Boom look

95
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,280
like because you must remember to win

96
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
because of the regulatory framework that

97
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
most organizations fall under now you've

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,120
got 72 hours to report it to the data

99
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,519
protection commissioner and what do you

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,659
really know that's happened to your

101
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,940
organization in 72 hours I mean it's

102
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,800
terrifying what did it take or they're

103
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,180
still in there have they implemented a

104
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,580
back door it's a real real problem for

105
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,739
for companies so the the right and left

106
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,140
the boom concept is is excellent and

107
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,700
it's it's definitely something that's

108
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,959
worth looking at

109
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,080
um and and all in I think it was uh from

110
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,700
my perspective I think was the best zero

111
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,319
Decon we've ever done

112
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,019
um and um thank you all so much for

113
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,840
coming and hopefully the next 12 months

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
we know in the next zero decant is going

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,819
to be a great one in cyberspace thank

116
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,190
you very much

117
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,970
