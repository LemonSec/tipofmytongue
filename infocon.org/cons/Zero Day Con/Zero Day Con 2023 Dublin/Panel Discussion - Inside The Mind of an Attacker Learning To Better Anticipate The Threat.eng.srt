the Mind of an attacker learning how to

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,460
better anticipate the threat would you

very good at Derek from the field season

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,580
4 checkpoint I've only been at

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,220
checkpoint for 13 months so quite new

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,439
into checkpoint but I've done lots of

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,840
big roles mainly cios and Healthcare oil

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,299
and gas media so it's the first time

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,799
I've worked for a vendor the rest have

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,840
all been as a consumer okay so you've

42

excellent very good and Anthony tell us

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,479
your own get visibility I'm Anthony

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,280
Lyons I'm the chief cluster officer with

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,579
get visibility we're AI enabled data

47
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,280
classification company and uh yeah great

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,659
to be here yeah very good I'm going to

49
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
begin with you if I can Anthony because

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,700
uh we we saw uh Edwards and his

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,619
abilities there right if we can call

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,899
them that your car will be fine don't

53
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,299
worry about it he has a nice car himself

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,079
um

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,060
what's the current profile of the threat

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,740
actor I mean we talked about the

57
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,360
teenager in the hoodie but you know we

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,739
we then realized it's a lot more

59
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,300
sophisticated than that these are actual

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,379
businesses

61
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,599
but that still doesn't codify what a

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,580
threat actor is or what is the threat

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,340
exactly and we've we've heard a lot of

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,500
talk about like you know the the guys in

65
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
the hoodies the the script kiddies you

66
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,580
know the the people uh the people who

67
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,520
are external threats you know and to use

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,620
a little bit of a squishy analogy you

69
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,200
know if you're pointing your finger out

70
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,060
you always have three fingers pointing

71
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,099
back at you so if we're saying that the

72
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,080
threat is out there you got to remember

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,360
that there's also three fingers pointing

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,920
back at you and there's a threat on the

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,099
inside too so let's not forget about the

76
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,540
inserted threat and it comes back again

77
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
to another topic that everybody's been

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,980
talking about is people

79
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,400
um you know people who create content

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,780
and create codes and create and create

81
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,519
the value to the business they feel

82
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,879
ownership of that and they they feel

83
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,440
that they can potentially take it when

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,060
they're leaving or they can give it to

85
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,680
whoever they want

86
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,540
um particularly if they get annoyed if

87
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,159
you annoy somebody

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,980
um they turned from being an ally to an

89
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,540
enemy I mean it does happen from time to

90
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,060
time and like I think of Jurassic Park

91
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,159
for example as as a classic Hollywood

92
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,220
example where things go wrong uh so you

93
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,780
need to look as much inside as you do

94
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,300
have to absolutely absolutely and like

95
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,620
some of the basic hygiene of

96
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,720
understanding like who has access to

97
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,019
your data uh you know like there's

98
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,700
there's no you can red team all you like

99
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,099
but if your engineering team have access

100
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,560
to your HR data and they can access the

101
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,299
salaries of all of your employees you

102
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,340
know that's a that's a big threat or if

103
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,319
you're a count team or somebody new in

104
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,940
your account team could potentially take

105
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,700
all of your your commercial contacts and

106
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,140
take them away very very easy it's it's

107
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,060
a huge threat after the high court you

108
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,060
go um Derek if I can talk to you you've

109
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,140
seen those threats you mentioned the

110
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,580
different sectors that you're in and and

111
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,319
the threats that were there previously

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,599
but then we have emerging threats and we

113
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,940
have new threats so in your opinion what

114
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,959
are the emerging threats that

115
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,360
organizations are likely to face in the

116
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,400
next year or so some of them will be the

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,440
same as contracts so I think it will be

118
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
an escalation of current threats there's

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
a bit of a game changer going on around

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,500
ransomware at the moment ransomware and

121
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,840
uh because there's a lot less

122
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,780
organizations paying the ransom

123
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,100
ransomware is very much changing to

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,840
exfiltrating the data rather than

125
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,699
encrypting the data is getting in

126
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,620
getting out very quickly and it's

127
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,540
actually then been able to use that data

128
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,820
either to to Blackmail to threat to

129
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,139
actually release that data so that's

130
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,940
very much the pivots happening within

131
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,680
ransomware we're going to see much more

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,900
disruption so we're already starting to

133
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,540
see that much more DDOS much more DDOS

134
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,639
backed by artificial intelligence

135
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
machine learning these three actors

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
we've talked about their exceptionally

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,940
clever people they're sophisticated

138
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,560
they're not script kiddies they're

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
saying in organizations they've got

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,940
access to all the best tools so we need

141
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,860
to be getting into an offensive mode but

142
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,960
on defensive mode is where I think you

143
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
know you need to do that offensive

144
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,020
mindset which is you know what can we do

145
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,639
to actually prevent this rather than

146
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,960
actually what we're going to do when we

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,540
are when it goes absolutely how do we

148
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,800
employ those tools though I mean

149
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,660
obviously we have white hat hackers who

150
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,759
are helping us you've got all your your

151
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,160
security levels in place but how do we

152
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,400
try to even just keep up with those new

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,199
threats as they emerge so I think

154
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,120
there's a few things you can do first of

155
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
all I'll ask everyone here to ask more

156
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,960
of your vendors that's where I would

157
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,940
start you know there's far too many

158
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,680
vulnerabilities in the vendor products

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,360
you've got out there you're buying you

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,620
know if you're buying products and the

161
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,300
products are vulnerable you've actually

162
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,740
brought vulnerabilities into your

163
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
network so speak to them to say what are

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,220
they doing around it you still get a lot

165
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,020
of vulnerabilities both in clouds and

166
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,419
remote access gateways that third-party

167
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,280
stuff there there's good technology out

168
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,600
there definitely you need to be looking

169
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,580
into technology that sits in that AI

170
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,740
space because in order to be combating

171
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,840
the type of AI attacks you're getting

172
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,820
it's having technology in there that can

173
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,800
react that quickly the humans can't

174
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,139
react that quick humans are great at two

175
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,699
in the morning when you phone them up to

176
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,560
say what's the plan what's a Playbook

177
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,020
what do we do now but you need to marry

178
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,940
that same level of EI preventative

179
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,860
technology along with what the talkers

180
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,320
have got one of the challenges Jenny

181
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,580
would be

182
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,680
how did you put a team in place that can

183
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,940
respond to those threats and have

184
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,380
diversity with a big D as opposed to a

185
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,600
small d uh and you've got people in

186
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,220
there who understand both the threat to

187
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,740
the business the impact it has on

188
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,600
perhaps your clients and your data but

189
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,160
also the outcome on the far side as well

190
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
if things go wrong so it's about making

191
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,780
sure that it's not just a kind of a

192
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,940
single we sit in a we sit in a cyber

193
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,199
security hotel and get called out from

194
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,840
or needed it's more of a a diverse team

195
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,479
as needed isn't it absolutely and in the

196
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,220
same way that that we shouldn't assume

197
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,759
that all hackers are teenage white men

198
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,639
you know we shouldn't make our teams

199
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,979
um just full of one kind of person and

200
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,960
that that's not just saying that that

201
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,639
all teens must have a woman and must

202
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,259
have a you know you don't take all the

203
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,940
boxes either but there should be enough

204
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,160
variety within the teams that you're you

205
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,660
allow them to think outside of the box

206
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,100
so I was thinking about this last night

207
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,280
and I show my age but how many people in

208
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
the room would remember the A Team oh

209
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
yeah yeah okay I don't know if Chris is

210
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,580
still here

211
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,800
runs earlier on of you responded to

212
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,780
what's wrong with you I mean I did

213
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,819
Jurassic Park and now everything now

214
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,220
we've got the 80. we're living in the

215
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,919
80s so with the A Team you've got four

216
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,780
very different personalities I mean it's

217
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,400
really tempting to fill your team with

218
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
four uh hannibals you know they're the

219
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
brains the operation they're coming up

220
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,440
with all of these solutions to the

221
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,180
problems but if you don't have the other

222
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,979
three characters then you're not

223
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,060
actually going to come at it with a

224
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,099
holistic approach so your team whoever

225
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,020
it is we we all want to get the the

226
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,880
fresh out of college they've done all

227
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,740
the coding they're able to hack they've

228
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,479
done all of the possible training they

229
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,740
can do they're qualified up to the

230
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,240
eyeballs but we're not always

231
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,860
considering somebody who's returned to

232
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,180
work from a different career and then

233
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,740
they've re-qualified in cyber security

234
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,380
or maybe they've worked in an entirely

235
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,139
different career all together and you

236
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,940
know I've seen situations I I laughed

237
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,120
when when I got married we had dinner we

238
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,919
rented a restaurant it was 40 people

239
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,840
added and one of the things that came up

240
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
was what we're going to eat my husband's

241
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,020
into food the chef obviously is into

242
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,060
food and they had this super fancy menu

243
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,560
that it out and I said you need to do

244
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,840
plain chicken my family will only eat

245
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,699
plain chicken so of the 40 people that

246
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,319
we're going to be at dinner 25 of them

247
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,940
were my family and he said there's no

248
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,200
way they're all going to eat plain

249
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,479
chicken

250
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,279
so begrudgingly they bought in the

251
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,919
chicken and on the Day 26 people ate

252
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,500
plain chicken and I said one went with

253
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,560
the heart exactly exactly so my point

254
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,779
there is that whilst it's tempting to go

255
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,760
with the crowd and want to do the right

256
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,140
thing and do the new thing and do the

257
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,640
fancy thing and have all of the best of

258
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,040
everything sometimes you've got to just

259
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,959
listen to the person who's the expert in

260
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,360
that situation and it could be that

261
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,399
you're that you're protecting yourself

262
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
against attacks from other countries so

263
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,300
you need to think about how they work

264
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,339
versus how you do or from other

265
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,860
communities or for other purposes that

266
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,720
they're attacking and if you have a

267
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,760
diverse team that can think about things

268
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,519
in a broad and wide way then that's the

269
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,959
best way there is no homogeneous

270
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,519
attacker so therefore your team

271
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,680
shouldn't be homogeneous as well um Bob

272
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,540
from your side one of the things we we

273
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,100
learned about in the last presentation

274
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,779
was the importance of testing systems

275
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,060
and sending

276
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,800
people in to see well where is the

277
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,180
vulnerability I mean the thing in Poland

278
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,560
was absolutely hilarious I walked in

279
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,660
through the back door but other than

280
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,820
that it's about putting the systems to

281
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,860
the test how important is it to do that

282
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,480
in a controlled environment number one

283
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,240
very controlled but also you will

284
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,279
inherently have people and I Know It

285
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,560
people I go well I know I'm terrified

286
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,940
it'll happen but I think we're all right

287
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,040
how important is it to prove them wrong

288
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,540
occasionally

289
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,600
well I you know I would close quote uh

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,060
closets you know no good plan survives

291
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,279
contact with the Enemy right so that

292
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,620
typically turns everything on its ear

293
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,240
but I would say starting from the

294
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,339
beginning of your question it's all it

295
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,399
is all about people and uh there aren't

296
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,260
enough of them to hire so there's two to

297
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,700
four million open cyber security jobs

298
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,880
depending on which report you find so I

299
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,500
would say that finding quality people

300
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
and enough of them and holding on to

301
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,339
them for as long as you can is probably

302
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,100
the most critical thing but certainly uh

303
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,980
you know practicing your tabletop

304
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,540
exercises and things like that is

305
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,920
extremely important in building that

306
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,380
muscle memory to where when things go

307
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,019
bad really bad at 2 A.M or even 4 a.m

308
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,180
that you know exactly what to do and how

309
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,500
to do it and who's going to do it and

310
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,560
then also make a plan for things to fail

311
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,620
when you are preparing that plan what's

312
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,600
the main motivation in getting the team

313
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,300
to come along with you is it I mean the

314
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,339
old thing would be Peter yeah Pizza yeah

315
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,279
clearly spend 48 on Pizza

316
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,800
um but is it your job's going to be

317
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,899
under threat if this goes wrong or is it

318
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,339
the business is under threat if this

319
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,959
goes wrong how do you motivate somebody

320
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,000
who's trying to do their best

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
to just do that a little bit extra to

322
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,779
make sure the system is robust I I don't

323
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,279
yeah I don't think threatening to lose

324
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,560
their job or lose their Pizza is a good

325
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,380
way to do it but I would say uh you know

326
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,300
the gamification is a really powerful

327
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,459
thing today and probably always has been

328
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,399
but um you know understand the attacker

329
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,700
and wanting to beat them is is extremely

330
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,160
important because this is you know this

331
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,140
is a great business for for folks you

332
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,220
know Whitehead blackouts trying to

333
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,420
figure out what the motivation is the

334
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,579
attribution and all that good stuff and

335
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,040
so for me you know channeling my inner

336
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,399
Mr T A Team yeah do you not like planes

337
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,920
no I would say uh the idea of of of

338
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,300
winning the battle you know the capture

339
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,700
the flag mentality and and that sort of

340
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,040
thing so you know maybe maybe give this

341
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,420
person a plaque or something and I know

342
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,860
money motivates and all that good stuff

343
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,500
but uh it is pretty cool to kind of win

344
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,600
yeah and it is effectively it's a form

345
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,880
of role-playing Anthony in more ways

346
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,019
than one

347
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,540
um when you're looking at it then so if

348
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,160
you have let's go back to the inside

349
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,480
your thresh idea that you were talking

350
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
about so

351
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,579
uh if that person wants to rob the

352
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,899
financial information the wages

353
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,940
information but then they're really

354
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,579
annoyed and they take the contacts book

355
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,200
and then they're really annoyed and then

356
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
they take the patent of products that

357
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,459
haven't hit the patent office yet

358
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,139
should they have access to all of that

359
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,240
information or is it part of what you do

360
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,920
when you're building your threat Matrix

361
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
that you compartment to life yeah this

362
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,680
like it's such a huge question it's such

363
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
a big elephant to eat you know you have

364
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,240
to understand your data security posture

365
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,519
and basically have your

366
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
um have a plan around okay who has

367
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,660
access to what and

368
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,720
one of the big things is understanding

369
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
what is actually on your data like what

370
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,620
data do you have what's important what's

371
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,660
private what's public you need to

372
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,399
classify all of that data that's get

373
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,959
visibility thing isn't it because you

374
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,399
know you actually end up having so much

375
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,660
data you don't know what you have

376
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,920
exactly and I think there is an

377
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,180
admission that we heard earlier on that

378
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,339
like you know nine out of 10 times or

379
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,740
you know people just don't know what

380
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,920
they have and imagine your 2 A.M phone

381
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,680
call again and it's okay what was taken

382
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,079
well we know there's like

383
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
a pencil Blazers days of God yeah you

384
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
know 99 times out of 10 that I said

385
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,339
earlier yeah what's gone it's it's

386
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,220
really difficult to know without

387
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,420
understanding your data and that's where

388
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,180
it comes up to flesh that out Derek if

389
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,079
we can

390
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,540
um sometimes organizations are really

391
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,519
bad at sharing internally particularly

392
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,519
if it might expose them to others as

393
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,459
being not as good as they should be when

394
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,019
it comes to sharing information on cyber

395
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,940
security it doesn't matter you shouldn't

396
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,820
have anyone trying to protect their own

397
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,860
little kingdom you should be sharing

398
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,899
across the organization shouldn't you

399
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,820
I think we need to be much more

400
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,060
transparent and share a lot more as a

401
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,380
community I think

402
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,500
we lawyer up too often as well so I

403
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,180
think sharing within organization is

404
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,279
important it needs to share right up to

405
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,600
the board the Seesaw doesn't sit on the

406
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,760
board then the season needs to find a

407
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,959
way of sharing up to the board that's

408
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,300
critical so boards understand this is

409
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,440
what we're talking about this is what we

410
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,839
risk we need to share a lot more around

411
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,399
incidents when we've actually had an

412
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,980
instance to what it was you know I can

413
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,260
probably think of a little bit two cyber

414
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,519
incidents in the last three four years

415
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,980
that I would call complex the rest have

416
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,199
all been preventable yeah no I would go

417
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,880
further on saying they've actually all

418
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,920
been easily preventable including that

419
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
Jesse very usable so you know we're not

420
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,199
trying to have blame but at the end of

421
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
the day somebody somewhere could have

422
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,740
done better and I think if you

423
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,959
communicate what the risks are some of

424
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,820
the weaknesses of you if you then

425
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,860
communicate to others when we had a big

426
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,540
breach across in Scotland and I was in

427
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,899
the NHS we had a breach with our

428
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,220
Environmental Protection Agency called

429
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,800
sipa and what we did is I brought the

430
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,100
chief executive of sipa in to meet 22

431
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,440
Chief Executives of NHS Scotland now

432
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,940
they were sitting there thinking we're

433
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,260
doing we're doing a pretty good job

434
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,360
we've dropped cyber Essentials and plus

435
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,699
and we get audited for National critical

436
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,160
infrastructure so we were good it

437
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,360
changed the mindset when you brought

438
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,820
someone senior in that said I was

439
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,279
sitting on the 24th of December and I

440
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,899
got a phone call in my mobile that said

441
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,779
we had no longer access to any systems

442
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,920
email teams SharePoint files we've lost

443
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,260
the disaster recovery plans that's what

444
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,420
he brought into the NHS thing you might

445
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,560
think you're sitting there and you're

446
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,740
prepared one it will happen to you until

447
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,440
you're never prepared and the question I

448
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
would always ask is so can you be doing

449
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,360
more now and if internally you think I

450
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,339
can be doing a lot more now then I think

451
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,199
you should be doing but definitely we've

452
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,579
got to start sharing an awful lot more

453
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,980
because there was a panel at this event

454
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,480
last year there was somebody from the

455
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,820
aviation sector uh taking part in it and

456
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,680
they talked about in aviation they have

457
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
a zero fault robotic reporting system

458
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,940
whereby if something goes wrong in an

459
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,279
aircraft you report it and you don't get

460
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,959
into trouble necessarily you're saying

461
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,940
that I did I had to do a missed approach

462
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,860
because I went too low and as a result

463
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,360
the plane had to go around and I burnt x

464
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
amount of fuel and that pilot doesn't

465
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,660
get into trouble but it means that

466
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,579
everybody reports in and you have better

467
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,720
data

468
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,760
that's what we need really when it comes

469
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,860
to cyber security isn't it that uh that

470
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,779
looked that looked a bit dodgy we shot

471
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,000
that down but that means that we have a

472
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,259
vulnerability there and if I have that

473
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,820
vulnerability in my department you have

474
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,079
it in yours as well is that what you're

475
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,300
talking about absolutely is you know we

476
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,339
it's not a blame game it's a learning

477
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,560
game it's an improving either an oil and

478
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
gas side a cloud environment that got

479
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,980
compromised a developer opened from

480
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,380
ports so it was devops with all the keys

481
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,240
we came into Monday morning it had been

482
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
compromised now

483
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,020
these things happen unfortunately the

484
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,240
sad thing for me was it took us two days

485
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,699
to actually find out what had happened

486
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,799
and it took two days of speaking to the

487
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,540
teams to try and work out food actually

488
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,339
made the mistake

489
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,919
and because you know the there wasn't a

490
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,720
blame culture but somebody somewhere was

491
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
scared that uh rather than being open

492
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,740
and honest and upfront to say I did this

493
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,059
and this is this is how we move forward

494
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,400
and learn from it it was you know it's

495
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,020
we're not going to own up to see we were

496
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,760
the ones that actually caused hundreds

497
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
of thousands of pounds of cost and

498
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,720
damage to our development it's back to

499
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,039
pointing the finger at whoever in

500
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,780
Beaumont hospital opened the phishing

501
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,400
email that resulted in the HSE hack

502
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
Jennifer can we protect everything I

503
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
mean like ultimately that's is that a

504
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
Fool's Aarons thinking that we can

505
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,679
protect everything with so many threat

506
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,320
actors pushing and looking for little

507
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,940
tiny cracks that they can get into

508
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,160
absolutely and temptedness is to give

509
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,000
you just the short answer of no but

510
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,100
um yeah it's now possible to protect

511
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,960
everything and I think even even if you

512
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,299
power everything down and you still have

513
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,740
humans that can be the problem and even

514
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,299
if you remove all the humans then the

515
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,580
technology still can can create its own

516
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,679
problems not as many as humans do but

517
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,919
it's all still compromisable as such and

518
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,799
I I think all you can do is be open and

519
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,840
honest and transparent and I always

520
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,059
preach transparency and I have worked in

521
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,880
environments where you know it was more

522
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,140
than a slap on the wrist if you did

523
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,340
anything wrong when you're maintaining

524
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,080
systems and it was absolutely the wrong

525
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,760
way to work because for days weeks

526
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,559
months people would not say a word about

527
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,419
what it was that they knew had gone

528
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,700
wrong and that's the biggest risk of all

529
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,919
there needs to be an understanding and

530
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,600
like I say at sea level and board level

531
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,260
about the the reality of the volume of

532
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,539
information that these teams need to

533
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,100
know about never mind what they do with

534
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,419
that information then when they get it

535
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,799
but when you're trying to like I've

536
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,200
worked for many many companies and many

537
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,120
businesses understanding their attack

538
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,520
surface and how many have spoken to over

539
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,900
time that because of budget they look

540
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,780
after their service or or and they'll

541
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,880
only focus on what they know about like

542
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,299
laptops and servers reducing the the

543
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,400
access to USB ports the words they know

544
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,260
yeah yeah but they're not thinking about

545
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,059
any other devices that you know if you

546
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,679
walk around even your home there's

547
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,240
devices that a Flicker and I'm plugged

548
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,799
in all over the place that they're

549
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,880
absolutely not thinking about that

550
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
around their Network that are I really

551
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,520
want to be hacked through my robot

552
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,020
lawnmower I've mentioned it on a number

553
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,000
of previous year day kind of events I

554
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,320
really want to be hacked if I'm going to

555
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,700
be hacked through anything I want it to

556
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,580
be the lawnmower it would be interesting

557
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,500
I mean we could put it on the slide it'd

558
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,580
be good

559
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,400
um but Bob if I don't I mean that was

560
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,559
not at that I'm warning Edwards do not

561
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,880
do it

562
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,000
um finishing up Bob if I can with you

563
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,580
you talk about the the kind of the

564
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,020
battle of Wales between the good guys

565
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,460
and the bad guys the people coming in

566
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,960
and using that as motivational Factor

567
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,059
one of the key things that teams would

568
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,559
need to understand is what's the

569
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,480
motivation of the bad guy

570
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,620
um because we would have always

571
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,140
continually said he's in it to make

572
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,220
money he's in it to to turn a book and

573
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,620
to uh go out and sell data or whatever

574
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,820
is that pure motivation now what's the

575
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,380
motivation well in the case of my

576
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,880
children it's to expand their screen

577
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,160
time or get access to my Amazon account

578
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,340
but I would say the motivation is really

579
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,440
pre-positioning for more of Ip

580
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,140
exfiltration as well as Nations did you

581
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,240
know in terms of industrial Espionage as

582
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,780
well I think that in a lot of cases

583
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,400
ransomware

584
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,840
uh what appears to be financially

585
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,419
motivated is obfuscation for something

586
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,220
much larger and again it's

587
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,960
pre-positioning for a larger attack and

588
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
also through QA testing their software

589
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,799
just like anybody else would they're

590
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,080
using automation or QA testing and

591
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,220
they're very smart people they're

592
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,660
actually sometimes they just want to win

593
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,799
and prove that they can take somebody

594
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,840
down so they can recruit talent because

595
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,299
again there's not enough people to hire

596
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,419
even for the Bad actors yeah so it's a

597
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,100
talent War so we cannot Point our

598
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,840
fingers to use your analogy we can't

599
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Point our fingers and go on it is the

600
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,419
Russians are it is the that's a cop-out

601
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,700
in a way because I mean what are they

602
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,280
gonna defend themselves some hours yeah

603
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,840
you know they you can't prove yourself

604
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,080
either way but uh no it's really uh

605
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,940
pervasive you know ransomware as a

606
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,160
service is coming on board right now but

607
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,419
a lot of it's not just for financial

608
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,600
gain it's it's industrialized everything

609
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,940
everywhere all at once well which we

610
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,299
hope doesn't win the Oscars yeah

611
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,860
it's been wonderful to talk you through

612
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,659
uh everything that we've spoken about on

613
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,100
stage would you please thank you our
