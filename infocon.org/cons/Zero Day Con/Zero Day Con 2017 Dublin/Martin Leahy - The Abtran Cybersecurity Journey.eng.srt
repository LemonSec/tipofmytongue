151
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,660
that's why I've kind of had to build

security layers between the two a lot of

158
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,700
upgrading a lot of patching and you know

159
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,230
quite difficult to merge data or ever

get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear picture of data and</font>

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,330
worried about that traffic what sort of

it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about data anymore it's</font>

293
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,609
forth we're very clear what

294
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,230
functionality is being hit we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

295
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:49,109
shut down disk arrays and scan them and

296
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,149
clean them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and you know</font>

297
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:54,089
what's missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here on this network that</font>

298
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,039
we had is there's no seam there there's

299
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,259
no monitoring we were in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects to get funding for</font>

302
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,850
afternoon the capital got approved and

00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:07,319
we we hadn't we installed there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> seam</font>

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,179
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon and pretty quickly the</font>

305
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,979
same started analyzing checking seeing

00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,929
what the problem was an actual fact the

307

same showed the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning then it's</font>

00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,949
taken a copy of the data back out

through your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your far wall we were lucky</font>

315
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,499
the reasons we survived that attack with

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus and dedicated team educated team</font>

317
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:37,560
we had the right tools and the seam came

318
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,570
in quickly

319
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an educated workforce with our</font>

agents on the floor who started

321
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,320
reporting started shutting down the

322
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,849
machines and telling us when there's a

323
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,500
problem with a very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font>

critically and this is really really

326
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,390
important we knew our data we knew where

it was we knew what was in the cloud we

knew what was local absolutely important

329
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:00,839
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the apt rent of today we have</font>

much more serious protection on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

good report there<font color="#CCCCCC"> shana what was that</font>

338
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,010
period for about two months was it our

339
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,810
annual eight months so over eight months

340
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,870
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a twenty one percent of our</font>

the fight against<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber crime Watson has</font>

we're way ahead of the attacks we can

357
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,230
recognize them much more easy and much

358
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,910
more straightforward way so that's kind

359
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,730
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story but I want to go back to a</font>

basic a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here similar area</font>

361
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,990
to me and it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the same it's</font>

problems we've always faced just a

367
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,060
threat to come from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slightly different</font>

368
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,410
area that's the only change and from our

369
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,420
point of view an apt ran we would

370
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,699
recommend these are the four key steps

371
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,490
you need to follow a point and train

372
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,980
your security function order and

373
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,720
classify your data and use that to get

374
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,339
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data you don't need if there's</font>

375
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,470
metadata there you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask yourself</font>

376
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,390
why if I got metadata what it is for is

377
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,760
it performing a business function is it

378
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,380
making me a my business<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal better and</font>

379
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,870
if it's not get rid of it put routines

380
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,019
in place to get rid of it similarly you

381
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,779
know
