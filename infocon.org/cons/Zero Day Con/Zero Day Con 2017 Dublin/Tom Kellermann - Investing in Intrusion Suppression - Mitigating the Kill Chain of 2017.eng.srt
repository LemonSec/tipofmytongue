220
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,039
noted through my work in a security

221
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,589
community for 19 years now is that

222
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,179
attacks have become more punitive more

223
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,999
and more destructive attacks are being

224
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:09,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">used as counter incident response as we</font>

225
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,969
modernize and become<font color="#CCCCCC"> more effective in</font>

226
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,949
our infinite response and our

227
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,379
orchestration and are reacting to the

228
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,999
adversary as we deploy technologies like

229
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,319
fire I to terminate command and control

230
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,649
because they have a footprint on our

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,939
system they become angry if you were to

232
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">wake up in the middle of night to hear</font>

233
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,749
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your house and to scream out</font>

234
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,789
I know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I'm calling the cops</font>

235
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:31,099
you're making an assumption that you've

236
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,049
scared them you're making an assumption

237
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:34,729
that this adversary will leave your home

238
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,429
you're making an assumption that's

239
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,199
critically flawed in today's environment

240
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,029
they might choose to set<font color="#E5E5E5"> your house on</font>

241
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:42,859
fire which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why you're seeing more and</font>

242
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,139
more wiper malware and more and more

243
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,180
ransomware being deployed not a part of

244
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,069
extortion or for the proceeds of

245
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,229
criminal gain but for the fact that it's

counter<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident response driven</font>

247
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,819
underneath those tactical shifts we must

248
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:02,120
respect that geopolitics now serves<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

apparent to us from my humble

407
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,060
perspective intrusive suppression is

408
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,800
best suited when you deploy things like

409
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,989
a deception grid when you apply user

410
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,729
entity behavior analytics when you

411
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,440
utilize adaptive authentication to

412
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,510
change credentials on the fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

413
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,520
escalate them up based on the fact that

414
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,110
they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been compromised to use</font>

415
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,790
things like memory augmentations you

416
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,680
hunt the adversary in real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at a</font>

417
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,390
minimum your lawyers have recourse or at

418
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,310
the minimum various law enforcement

419
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,170
organizations can leverage the

420
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">attribution that you've proven for your</font>

421
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,360
exercises and then lastly it's about a

422
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,310
corporate decision internally about<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

423
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will actively pursue a methodology</font>

like active response what I challenge

425

you here with today is simply this that
