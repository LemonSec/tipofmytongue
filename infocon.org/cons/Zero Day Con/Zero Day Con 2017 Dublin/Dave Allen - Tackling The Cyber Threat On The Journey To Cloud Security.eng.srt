00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,670
about the increasing scale and the

changing scale of cyber threat what

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,639
we're going to talk a little bit about

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,770
now is the changing nature of those

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,740
cyber threats and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implications</font>

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,359
particularly for cloud security will you

only to pressure places to be in a

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,449

to make this compelling and and a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,129
around cloud and cloud security so i

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,780
figured i would go back a little bit

24
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,530
first though maybe ask you a question

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">and start hopefully with a hopefully</font>

pushing the right button own okay what

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,060
first happen there we go so start with

it with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice mistakes or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

you remember the ascii text the blocky

text and you'd be putting in a boot disk

43
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,579
that talked all around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AIDS research</font>

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a somewhat disenchanted a man</font>

he would little a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen that</font>

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,960
would come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say hey so you could</font>

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,899
post me a check to this address in

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first examples of where ransomware</font>

57
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,690
came

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,640
so when I look to the concept of the

59
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,900
changing threat then I did a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,149
research from our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,069
intelligence and looked at what's been

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,290
going on potentially in Ireland in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,910
last 90 days I see the little chart on

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top there top right there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

66
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,069
starting from the first of September so

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,140
I just said let's have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

68
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,700
last few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months give you an idea what</font>

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of shows you in the middle CH</font>

70
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,030
are there you've got which industries

71
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,370
for securities and finance

72
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,450
unsurprisingly heavily hit on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">left-hand side there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of</font>

the most common vectors and where are

76
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,420
the threats coming from and what type of

77
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,620
threats are they and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important</font>

78
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,790
for you because if you look at all these

79
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,320
different hotspots of where they're

80
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,269
coming from around the world the

81
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,030
destination of that particular analysis

82
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,590
I pulled is here so that particular

83
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,569
threat analysis was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> around what's</font>

84
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,190
going on against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ireland in the last</font>

85
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,988
bunch of days and if you look to the

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,609
right bottom right-hand chart here the

87
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,780
reason i start with the ransomware story

88
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,580
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still one of the most prevalent</font>

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,880
things that showed up in our third

90
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,920
intelligence is is lucky so locking is

91
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,190
the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of malware and</font>

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,450
ransomware so so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

93
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,650
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> tempted to call the first light who</font>

94
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,060
did you annoy and the answer be

95
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,950
everybody in the world and then look

96
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,150
what they're all doing but also an awful

97
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,950
lot of the attacks he originated from

98
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,690
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks at about a quarter</font>

99
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,480
of a million transactions and around

100
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,579
about 45,000 unique malware versions

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,780
seen in that time it kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of drops off</font>

102
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest me just at the start of</font>

103
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,739
februari and you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low key</font>

104
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,209
perspective which probably means it's

105
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,269
being replaced by a different variant of

106
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,040
the same thing so so when you look to

107
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,930
what's changing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of in the</font>

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,700
world of cyber security and with the

109
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,049
world of threat the threats are evolving

110
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,600
the nature of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> these types of things</font>

111
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,370
are happening is changing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

112
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,019
same time in some senses there's some

113
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,430
consistency to it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

114
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,109
becomes quite important when we look to

115
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:07,049
to what the what the cloud is so what

116
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:09,720
are the guys looking for and the reality

117
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the data is the new oil so i think it</font>

118
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,200
was Martin at the very start talked

119
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,790
around no they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font>

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,140
getting in just to disrupt you they want

121
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,820
to get stuff out I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go steal</font>

122
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,529
stuff they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take things some of</font>

123
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,909
its inconvenience ransomware is a

124
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-billion dollar industry these days</font>

125
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">as one example but a lot of it is around</font>

126
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,870
packing crown jewels is obviously

127
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,340
all know government-to-government

128
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,350
espionage all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

129
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,400
around online voting and stuff came up

130
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,440
earlier there was something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font>

131
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,690
elections that's obviously been pretty

132
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,280
popular recently and so when you go back

133
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,510
to two thousand seven if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

134
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,640
small place in the Baltics called

135
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,870
Estonia then they had a bit of a dispute

136
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,700
with the Russians around moving a big

137
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,960
statue out of the city and<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing</font>

138
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,210
you know the entire country<font color="#E5E5E5"> is under a</font>

technologies are always wondering how

149
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,330
the hell to save<font color="#E5E5E5"> money because you're</font>

150
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,950
not supposed to delete it and then you

151
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,180
got a conflict coming up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> GDP are</font>

152
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,010
but that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tops in this discussion</font>

153
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,390
so one of the expectations<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">digital age I think this becomes quite</font>

timely given what's happened in the last

156
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,570
just in the last week in fact it's

158
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,219
everywhere it's hugely dynamic flexible

<font color="#E5E5E5">I pay to consume what I want and then</font>

160
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,720
this concept of secure by design and I

161
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the desire are not</font>

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,909

probably aware of Amazon's East Coasters

the storage infrastructure layer so you

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,670
know nothing lost ultimately all things

174
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,909
back online but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interesting</font>

Rick's presentation which I hugely

183
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,220
enjoyed it would simply be that he said

184
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,990
accountability passes out away from you

185
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,970
and I will argue that accountability and

186
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,780
responsibility never leaves you because

187
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,850
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> always be the one with the</font>

there's all the range of cloud security

206
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,490
providers that don't quite get that tag

207
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,680
of public cloud but in reality is still

<font color="#CCCCCC">outsourced services and outsourced</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an IDC an IDC survey to to the</font>

primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> barriers and both hugely</font>

relevant for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area that we're in</font>

214
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,550
right now security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one and the other</font>

215
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,160
which again<font color="#CCCCCC"> will come up again and again</font>

216
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,020
and this was this was conducted last

217
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,490
year but is around regulatory and

218
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,260
compliance issues and I know we're going

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to spend some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time this afternoon on GDP</font>

221
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,120
polarizing the the challenges around

222
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,580
security overall and making it less

223
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,100
deniable for companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations</font>

224
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,669
so security becomes one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

225
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest barriers to adoption when</font>

226
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:46,570
you think about what cloud has done

227
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,630
third for business then it's really

228
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,610
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility lines so there</font>

229
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,200
was a time when when the IT department

230
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,210
was responsible delivering everything

231
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,520
and that time let's say was seven or

232
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,810
eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago and then the this cloud</font>

233
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
thing appeared<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone said hey</font>

234
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,979
well I can get stuff faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

235
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,679
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to me by spinning up in these</font>

236
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,940
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> called Amazon and otherwise so I</font>

237
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,010
can get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card out and get a</font>

238
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,380
machine that whereas in minutes whereas

239
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,060
IT tells me six weeks to deploy and I

240
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,919
think that that evolution of that

241
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,110
process and the emerging rise of SAS

242
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,719
applications shall drop into in a second

243
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,849
have really<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed the control points</font>

244
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,650
for most organizations it's very easy to

245
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spin up services without ever</font>

246
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,310
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your IT department and</font>

247
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,930
specifically then within that even your

248
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,789
security guys there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of</font>

249
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,979
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pastor</font>

250
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,569
bypass those in theory corporate

251
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,370
controls think the other thing that's

252
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened at the same time linking to the</font>

253
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,240
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of IOT and otherwise is</font>

254
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,549
everything else has become networks and

255
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,260
increasingly networks then the the

256
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,910
threat landscape was the heroic term we

257
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,860
love to use the threat landscape gets

258
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,839
even broader control systems for power

259
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,790
stations with critical national

260
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,270
infrastructure all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things start</font>

261
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,949
to convert

262
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,720
in and around<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain types of network</font>

263
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,130
and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those necessarily we're</font>

264
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
going through some of the traditional

265
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,580
means that organizations had

266
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,460
unstructured in terms of how to go about

267
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,310
security so all of this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

reality for every world right now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

269
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,219
most companies you have a real mixed

draw the guy in the middle there with a

you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> control points of how they're</font>

294
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,060
doing certain things but in reality

295
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,170
they're consuming applications and

296
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,020
various different things in lots of

297
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,089
different ways our our research<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggests</font>

298
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,310
that most organizations think they're

299
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,650
using around about 60 SAS applications

300
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,290
but underlying they're using hundreds

301
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,209
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to an aerospace</font>

302
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,530
company last week<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're actually locked</font>

303
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,940
down with all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

304
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,980
same as the automotive guys we've got

305
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,020
super secure you dig into for a moment

306
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,340
as I thought guys emailing stuff around

307
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,160
the cloud and we know when are we using

308
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,690
365 okay well that's outside and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

309
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,980
they've got some stuff on dropbox and so

310
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,770
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alarm bells will start ringing</font>

311
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,270
and and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are those are done for</font>

312
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,280
good purpose the cloud offers

313
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,280
flexibility the cloud offers economics

314
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,470
and security like anything in life<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

risk evaluation how much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

316

spend versus the risk and the protection

317
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,620
I want to afford to myself so the

318
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,760
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what we see most times</font>

319
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,930
at the moment in all your gardener

320
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,910
surveys and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will tell you</font>

321
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,500
this is around about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five percent</font>

322
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">of companies now we're looking at almost</font>

323
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,270
completely in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public cloud the vast</font>

324
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,370
majority are looking at hybrid so some

325
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,930
form of I do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it myself and I use</font>

326
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,250
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I obviously consume external</font>

327
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,229
services some of that through

328
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,070
infrastructure consumption and some of

329
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,230
that through possibly

330
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:12,820
a specific application<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumption so I</font>

331
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,810
figured I would just maybe to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

332
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,310
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a moment just to make sure there's</font>

333
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,540
some a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical understandings i</font>

334
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,430
think around defining these three things

335
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,699
and this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> links back into that</font>

336
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,050
contact commentary around responsibility

337
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,210
so the first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the private cloud</font>

338
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,680
so the concept of in the private cloud

339
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,660
this is where you're doing it yourself

340
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,790
you're using a variety of technologies

341
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,290
probably most likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> in these days you</font>

342
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,360
are virtualized in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or</font>

344
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,020
you're providing a range of things to

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,060
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your users and you know that</font>

you're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your security you</font>

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes on inside your your</font>

351
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,990
cloud the benefit of private cloud

352

versus the old days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just data center</font>

353
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,280
really is virtualization technology has

354
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,579
provided flexibility and cost efficiency

355
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,589
in terms of consumption okay then you go

356
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,540
to the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where the lines</font>

357
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,030
start to blur this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no sorry / context i</font>

358
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,099
use Amazon and Microsoft as the two here

359
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,780
but you know they they own the

360
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,370
infrastructure the physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the</font>

361
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,810
layer all the things were on last week

362
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">no that was storage layer the network</font>

363
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,619
layer the server layer possibly up into

364
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the operating system and</font>

365
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,270
even the hypervisor you might be using

366
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,340
to consume it so but what Amazon and

367
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,510
Microsoft will tell you fundamentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

368
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,940
that they're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

369
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,470
security of the cloud this is where they

370
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,540
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about partnership in security</font>

371
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,850
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for your security in</font>

372
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,170
the cloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's a real</font>

373
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,070
nuance that people need to understand

374
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,479
which is why I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

375
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,540
responsibility piece doesn't really

376
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,040
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so so in that sense once you</font>

377
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,240
consuming the cloud you've decided to

378
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,949
consume infrastructure-as-a-service

379
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,840
you're going to stick workloads

380
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,610
applications data you're going to give

381
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,650
access to those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going</font>

382
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the one in control of that and so</font>

383
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,110
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

384
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,030
you've suddenly got to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

385
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,950
how do i secure myself inside that cloud

386
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,780
environment and the cloud offers many

387
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,430
things it offers all that consumption

388
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,630
flexibility but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

389
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,339
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a risk point and you need to</font>

390
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,350
think about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> your strategy for</font>

391
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,570
security will deploy you and take you

392
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,310
into that direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I think the</font>

393
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,340
last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the south side of thing so</font>

398
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,540
this situation those guys are taking

399
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,279
responsibility for the

400
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,959
employment of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform the</font>

402
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,930
within that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't take</font>

responsibility in reality for your data

404

nor the way that you use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so</font>

405
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,300
things like credentials one of them or

418
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,689
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit around email most people</font>

passing all your Excel spreadsheets

a posture you can use both on-premise

and extend into the cloud in some way

comment for the day is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

438
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,670
everything else in your life in case you

439
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,810
wanted any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ask your</font>

440
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,279
partner it was your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she's</font>

441
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,079
referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a moment so</font>

442
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhat contentious for for cloud</font>

443
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">suppliers but in a sense there is no</font>

444
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,050
cloud it's it's somebody else's computer

445
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,880
and then the amazon extort you know

446
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,529
shows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got matters of things</font>

447
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,819
around consumption and flexibility only

448
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,949
someone like an Amazon could release a

449
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,599
thousand new features a year so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

450
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:51,370
your the scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the magnitude what it</font>

451
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
has is huge but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just remember about the</font>

452
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,389
attackers they don't care far as they're

453
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,500
concerned you've helped you know and

454
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:58,120
monks all of us we've helps take all of

455
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,730
our crown jewels into a big place I can

456
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,130
go focus on an attack and so that's

457
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,240
argument me that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but</font>

458
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,250
their intent is pretty to gain access

459
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,660
and execute their goal that's all they

460
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,660
want to do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

461
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,389
it is so are the security risks

462
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,519
different and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it kind of the</font>

463
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,959
reality is no means some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

464
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,269
methods you know if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

469
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,170
you and infiltrate you and you know

470
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,490
there are the common thing in life only

471
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">two types of companies those have been</font>

472
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,150
hacked and those who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they</font>

473
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,930
have

474
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,870
I think that's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit pessimistic</font>

475
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,310
but the reality is that the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">will go through is similar in some way</font>

482
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,670
which is often<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the initial thing</font>

483
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they compromise okay Annie quite a</font>

484
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,229
common statistic this is where I think

485
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies looking to GDP are in having</font>

487
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,000
security and detection and analytics

488
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,220
because in most cases most companies

have been annotated for six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

scary thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so then they actually</font>

492
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,420
they go steal their data harvest

493
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,540
bitcoins which as we heard earlier is

494
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,459
worth more than golf so and build either

495
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,800
and build other things to actual tree so

496
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,570
in a sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same attack lifecycle is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">look at all of these different elements</font>

when you're looking at your overall

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to consider then malicious</font>

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,450
then there's one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's somewhere</font>

554
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,519
in here accidental data loss is one and

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,989
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes get told off for calling</font>

00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,519
that the dumb insider because that means

threats if you're if you're looking to

582
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,369
learn a bit more considerations so and

00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to declare what I need</font>

584
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,879
consider the same stuff my data where is

it resident what am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I doing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

obviously but you know personal health

identity the PCI side of things if

588
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:57,929
you're processing payments all of those

no matter where you're putting things in

591
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,909
the cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite often the first</font>

592
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,859
thing when we ask the customers is do

593
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,169
you even know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,029

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're trying to ball down to</font>

602
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,470
how to classify and how to analyze your

603
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,359

being consciously competent that you do

606
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:29,789
know where it actually is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

a massively subjective discussion right

you there's only so much you can ever do

but you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that you have</font>

done I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in specially for DDP are</font>

arguably literally arguably the most

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can or what you consider to be</font>

enough to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken all the due course</font>

637
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,460
and measure to drive that so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to drive if you</font>

little bit into into GDP are still in

644
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,940
contracts will need to be reassessed but

at the same time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going into</font>

not or you're planning to go this is a

648
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,000
massive massive consideration for you so

649
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,350
last couple of things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the art so we did a piece of work with</font>

them with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pwc some time ago to define</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call their kind of a cyber risk</font>

assessment framework and though<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

656
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,710
it's a set of steps and processes around

the priorities<font color="#CCCCCC"> to governance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to risk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I've already mentioned and then really</font>

660
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,699
when you get into how do I protect

661
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,379
myself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that environment the idea of</font>

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,150
observing everything visibility at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">and it has already happened you can't go</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to have visibility as part of that I</font>

668
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,780
think the days of you know email and

email and<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still very popular</font>

671
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,540
is very advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days and so we</font>

672
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,160
know you need to be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at users and</font>

applications and linking back to the

<font color="#CCCCCC">different things that that come together</font>

676
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,840
to help you using visibility and those

and those and analytics to find out

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,730
a practice if you're thinking about

cloud or whether it's even on premise

710
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,570
these are still the same steps you need

718
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,809
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and how you're doing a</font>

719
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:55,399
threat assessment overall so so in in

720
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,690
kind of closing up lots of different

721
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways to approach security in the cloud</font>

722
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,260
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the basic language in</font>

723
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,520
consideration is similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think most</font>

724
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,610
people going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up in in a hybrid</font>

725
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,870
environment so that's part one

726
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,729
segmentation is to segmentation meaning

727
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,979
separating out the financial systems

728
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,500
from the factory control systems from

729
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,720
the user access cell door the the sales

730
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,220
systems whatever those things may be and

731
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,799
in some cases in the virtualized world

732
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,630
we're talking around nano segmentation

733
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,490
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is I spin up a virtual</font>

734
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,960
machine for the moment really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need it</font>

735
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a transaction and I destroy it</font>

736
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,549
and move on the idea being to make it so

737
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,140
to minimize the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an</font>

738
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,149
attacker to find it see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do</font>

739
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,500
something for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it's moved on so</font>

740
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,699
you go into some areas in banking and

741
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">suchlike and they're looking at this</font>

742
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,110
this type of methodology using

743
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,419
technologies available to you but is

744
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,620
using them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so then</font>

745
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,029
you've got a pretty consider the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

746
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how you get in and out of the</font>

747
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:49,010
network world but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a gateway and</font>

748
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,539
access perspective but clearly also<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

749
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,220
your users are working outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

750
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:54,799
control and so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

751
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,659
that from a from a SAS point of view as

752
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,418
well most people are consuming something

753
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,860
in the in the SAS worlds and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

754
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,080
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network to do that so</font>

755
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,149
how do you have have inspection on that

756
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,350
our position on this would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

757
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:07,549
way to get all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and make</font>

758
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,529
it work properly would be to do

759
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,418
something is automated and integrated at

760
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,490
the prevention end because that's the

761
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:15,620
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way economically to actually combat</font>

762
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,820
the reality of the rising wave of people

763
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,340
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a start earlier around</font>

764
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,510
connectivity of devices in terms of how

765
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">many billions of things are connecting</font>

766
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,960
to the internet you think about users

767
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,370
took us really the last kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 20 years</font>

768
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">more or less to get about three</font>

769
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">billion users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet</font>

770
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,559
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> projections are take us five to get</font>

771
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the remaining three and a half to four</font>

772
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,580
billion so two great things that lots a

773
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,990
great opportunity for those of you

774
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,449
delivering services and finding clients

775
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,860
and using the web bad news at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

776
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,780
time that's bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> to proliferate a whole</font>

777
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,429
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new people also looking to do</font>

778
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,129
bad things on those on those networks as

779
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,240
well so it be wrong for me to be a

780
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,309
technologist not stick your crazy

781
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,330
diagram here like this so I guess when I

782
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:52,129
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a closing statement</font>

783
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,600
everything when you think about from

784
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,730
with your on-premise environments

785
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,929
through from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threat intelligence in</font>

786
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cloud how to understand what's going</font>

787
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,450
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage of all the</font>

788
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,160
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are happening</font>

789
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,230
around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world and learning from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

790
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,440
in an automated fashion has to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

791
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:09,170
the the endpoint through the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

792
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,390
and out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud in a consistent and</font>

793
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,570
integrated automated fashion that's what

794
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:18,140
we do and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think hopefully I'll say</font>

795
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:25,019
have a nice day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coffee down</font>

796
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,019
