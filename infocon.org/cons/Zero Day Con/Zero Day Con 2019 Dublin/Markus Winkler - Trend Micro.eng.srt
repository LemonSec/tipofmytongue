1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:09,460
let's talk about Devils there Segel's

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,930
containers humanities are using

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:16,090
humanities already cloud containers

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,369
container orchestration technologies

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,580
like that and I'm pretty sure you are

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:23,680
using it in a sense of DevOps lifecycle

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,520
everything automated for CSV pipelines

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,980
and security integrated you are the only

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:37,809
one at least brave enough to raise the

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:41,280
hand so the traditional approach as my

11
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:46,120
deduction were the site where the

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,479
product owner does decide on some

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:54,190
invention and some service to develop or

14
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:56,739
to change and tell them to do is

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:01,708
infinite and the developer as we all

16
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:07,090
know them as well lots of coffee and

17
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:09,660
cigarettes I was coding and having

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:14,080
changed in mind improvement in mind and

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,810
then on the other end I was not in

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,640
charge of driving my application so

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,260
there were other people in the

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,480
operations which were in charge of

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,640
stability driving my new service or my

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,670
adapted service and just before the

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,380
Lincoln in some cases I might have

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:37,300
thrown a new package of software over

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:40,690
the wall deployed I know the downside

28
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:45,460
was a beauty here is that the security

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:48,100
teams historically was not suddenly a

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,199
speed limiter no you can't deploy

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,350
because we need our security to drive

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,409
that securely or we need to be compliant

33
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,038
with this and there

34
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:02,750
decryption so it sometimes it slow down

35
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:07,759
the operations and then having in mind

36
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:09,769
the changing landscape of workloads so

37
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,900
I've broken the security since nearly 20

38
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:17,750
years and in dramatization but you only

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,519
use since cusses plenty of years and

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,519
then remember quite about all the time

41
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,739
when a cloud came up and nobody really

42
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,810
did understand what the heck is the

43
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,910
cloud is trainee there is it stormy what

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,910
why do we use cloud what's what is

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,519
benefit but a person now we all know

46
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,180
about the benefits of the cloud it just

47
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:42,080
takes seconds to start a fifty hundred

48
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,709
thousand something or to create a new

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:55,819
database because someone else is caring

50
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:58,190
for the backend and the cloud it was

51
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:01,488
quite rapidly and you could compare

52
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,970
potentially vacuum red star a try it

53
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,519
star which is rising very fast and is

54
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,120
getting enormous and then in containers

55
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,870
the micro services docker kubernetes

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,690
trial of me sauce you name it it's more

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,829
like a supernova

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,730
everybody who thought that the public

59
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:24,380
cloud is evolving at high speed

60
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:30,290
containers are doing that with

61
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:35,170
modernizing and that is of course

62
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:38,440
recognized by our CIOs or CEOs poor

63
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,089
containers and that funny thing

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,239
therefore I don't really understand

65
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,760
Bentley but in it should speed up our

66
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,190
production our time to market so

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,769
braces-girl for it and then turn the

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,270
operations to the driving force of the I

69
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:58,459
team they are the decision-makers now

70
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:02,180
because they need to begin to be more a

71
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:04,250
drive more speed Allah in putting new

72
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,980
services changed services into

73
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,330
production

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:15,290
Balaam contains they love demos it

75
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:46,389
enables you the company thousands of

76
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:46,389
changes per day so all the

77
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,849
organizational processes as well to get

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:11,150
benefits of that instant on web server

79
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:13,550
there's free build things we can and

80
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,539
ability to run the sons and one friend

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:21,590
over the clouds a bit changed across the

82
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:24,740
service model formally and I have to

83
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,590
admit in my in their own episode I have

84
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,810
some cats as well so servers driving my

85
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,060
own automation at least base with

86
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,110
finally taking care of it at the same

87
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,329
your IT infrastructure you

88
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:40,149
names like Asterix and Obelix Martina my

89
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:42,849
opponent whatever we all know the kind

90
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:46,029
of service we then can take care on that

91
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:49,889
service all services of course and if

92
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:52,659
there is a problem we nurse them back

93
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:59,559
but in the year of containers that you

94
00:05:52,659 --> 00:06:05,019
change just think on barbecue so so so

95
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:12,099
if I need one I take it if one is the

96
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:14,319
right so I really take care of meeting

97
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:15,819
each individual if I need another one I

98
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,549
just or another one

99
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,649
so that is continuous micro services so

100
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:24,638
come I don't fix anything anymore

101
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:28,779
I don't touch anything I just use it as

102
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,189
long as it doesn't work and their

103
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:36,189
believes us actually to the devops life

104
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:38,679
I'm I guess I would ask you to raise

105
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:43,539
your hands everybody has seen that life

106
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:46,299
cycle before cool so it's not a

107
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:50,169
technical thing yeah it's just about

108
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:55,419
organizational processes apparently so

109
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:57,128
the at the point zero there's a plan we

110
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,779
need to do something we need to build

111
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,309
something I tell the coders the

112
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:06,849
developers to code to realize and then

113
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:09,519
if something got coded it gets needs to

114
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:12,279
be built and tested for functionality of

115
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,289
course it then needs some kind of

116
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:23,679
release management to destroyed by the

117
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:26,469
pike stages problems whatever to induce

118
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:30,839
changes and since we are willing to

119
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:33,219
integrate all the known tools and

120
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,629
potentially innovative as mean tools

121
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:39,519
required to run that

122
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:43,200
so in that it's just a small little

123
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,020
fraction of technology is bad

124
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:56,050
in the space of their mouths and you see

125
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:59,460
well repository making dreible as build

126
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:06,250
tools testing tools like J units

127
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:13,919
selenium Jenkins skin happens all state

128
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:16,360
so complex but potentially one could say

129
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:21,130
plan might have something to do with

130
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:24,660
security or not yours all the rest it's

131
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:27,969
more or less building containers drug

132
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,030
running and deploying it there's no

133
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,070
intrinsic security inside there by the

134
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,429
it just works and it's fast the next

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,620
time and each in every day we get new

136
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,599
technology it's to Banaras everybody

137
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,000
should not be Panetta's given let us get

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,840
to release a major release each and

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,820
every three months

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:52,300
and cue bananas was that knowledge e

141
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,960
required just 17 days to get 15 million

142
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:01,089
users anybody know which application

143
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:08,770
that was running on human enters gaining

144
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:10,920
15 million users in 17 days no Pokemon

145
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,920
go

146
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:18,170
they're compared to Larry take the

147
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,620
detention at least 64 years people 50

148
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,360
million people going there so the speed

149
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:29,540
is enormous which you're gaining here

150
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,260
so security of course does not like

151
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:38,410
containers that much better Corrections

152
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,410
because the commonly used security tools

153
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:51,440
anymore before going with Cuban enters

154
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:54,170
for example so the parameter firewall or

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,390
IPS system does not see the traffic

156
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,269
anymore and it constantly constantly

157
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,550
changes the idea behind the things like

158
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:08,209
human Edison is that the container which

159
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:12,079
is on that 27 others as well may run on

160
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:14,390
completely different servers the next

161
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,489
day or the next minute so it constantly

162
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,339
changes in the network so the networking

163
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,630
the the node the type of communication

164
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:26,390
is in constant change and since

165
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,899
containers are known since 6 years

166
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:34,819
[Music]

167
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:38,200
driving up the building up webserver by

168
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:42,620
the use of container it's so easy just

169
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,620
download an image from dr. hunt and use

170
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:50,870
it drive your memory it never was so

171
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:56,180
easy but who does really verify is that

172
00:10:50,870 --> 00:11:02,690
container image you just download is

173
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:06,560
secure I take lots of the most used and

174
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:08,750
they all will contain high possibilities

175
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,439
but most people are not that we have

176
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:17,690
that so I said under images ran without

177
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,390
identities someone else didn't consider

178
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,220
this an HTTP demon very nicely I would

179
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,770
guess so because he is

180
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,840
not anymore I'm just using it so I leave

181
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,300
it as it is

182
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,220
you don't pet it and the internal

183
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,680
container network is a major issue for

184
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,950
them security which leads to vulnerable

185
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,560
code which leads to potentially included

186
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:44,390
murder from public sources and the

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:47,270
sequence commonly found in available

188
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,120
images integration privilege escalation

189
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:55,550
why does the container image needs to

190
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:58,310
run in criminals mode so there's

191
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:02,060
normally no reason for that and that was

192
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,219
as an attacker might just need to have

193
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,650
the chance to jump into a one specific

194
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,070
potato and traverse inside the container

195
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:12,199
network and may even reach the host or

196
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:19,450
in the data center from the container

197
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:23,450
rest world so what do we do now

198
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,940
so having all these nice fancy tools and

199
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,210
then laughs communities I always the

200
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,580
latest technology and then I don't I get

201
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,140
used to it talk about it and then start

202
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,590
searching for the next one so I love it

203
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:39,770
really what do how do we do it in the

204
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:42,790
secure in a safe way so that needs to be

205
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:46,910
some night changes the development

206
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,099
development container images doesn't has

207
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,199
the possibility any more than someone

208
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,050
else's probably didn't take the

209
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,720
responsibility for that he needs to be

210
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,229
rare that he buildeth and he runs it as

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,390
soon as

212
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,570
committing his code to build pipeline

213
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,720
the csv pipeline is driving is going to

214
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:10,530
the production and so each net without

215
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,690
change influences modifies production or

216
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,060
customers environment so the developer

217
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,720
needs to have that in mind the

218
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,239
operations needs to know that security

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,970
is essential even though we need to

220
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,340
speed up things even even if we need to

221
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,890
speed as much as possible because

222
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,100
someone else told us to do that and we

223
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,050
have the budget for that but very

224
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,180
important for the security as well it's

225
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,449
not only about compliance of course

226
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:43,260
compliance is really extremely relevant

227
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:48,720
would never tell to ignore and security

228
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:50,939
is absolutely relevant as well the

229
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,340
security needs to be aware of fact that

230
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,930
it's only a supporting tool for the

231
00:13:53,340 --> 00:14:02,340
value chain the company what security

232
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:07,140
you don't money as a company but you are

233
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,930
securing the possibility to earn them so

234
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,360
there needs to be some ways to be found

235
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,939
and to be integrated in here the

236
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,850
advanced life cycle and then deaths a

237
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,560
house lifecycle to support that from a

238
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:25,020
security point of view but them to slow

239
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:27,579
down from the nature edges that can be

240
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,800
done as a matter of fact

241
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,860
so of course the most dogs with the

242
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,640
coding and I'm pretty sure that in all

243
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,990
urine - and all your tea development

244
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,519
departments using follow security

245
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,750
they've had a secure development best

246
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,880
practices like reuse one of a born saw

247
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,990
aesthetic installs could analyze and

248
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,760
everything else which is required in in

249
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,940
software development and of course

250
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,170
educated security security wise

251
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:04,570
Education's developers for sure but then

252
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,029
if you can build something you should

253
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,140
analyze as well the second time from a

254
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,750
different perspective

255
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,399
you should analyze the building image

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,560
and just talking about containers

257
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,560
because everything else I'm told is

258
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:25,660
legacy so Richard is a legacy I we want

259
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:29,079
to get rid of so only containers for now

260
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:33,040
so you need to the very fire to validate

261
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:36,489
this bed just build image is build image

262
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,760
is secure in regards no member included

263
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,300
no credentials included no abilities are

264
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,850
critical for the politicus at least and

265
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,880
traditionally you pass that bill image

266
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:54,339
to a staging repository internal only

267
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:58,209
accessible for development and then you

268
00:15:54,339 --> 00:16:01,600
start your functional tests like is that

269
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:04,599
container behaving as it should be that

270
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,570
you are doing since a long time I

271
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,959
believe but the functional tests needs

272
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,880
to include security testing as well how

273
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,959
does the container behave from the

274
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,160
security perspective and then the

275
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,619
release management the release

276
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,630
management the driving force within the

277
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,980
csv pipeline the release management

278
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:28,899
actually makes the decisions when to

279
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,540
build something when to put something

280
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:34,940
where when to test something for

281
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,430
CUNY and functionality and so on and

282
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,760
drive it from the room so if the release

283
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:46,729
management would like get that agency we

284
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:49,370
are getting a report back that that

285
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,120
image has high critical vulnerabilities

286
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:57,980
then it should inform someone and not

287
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,050
let that image deploy dresses exam but

288
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,870
even if we go through the deployments

289
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:06,020
the stage can be insured being

290
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:11,390
responsible for deciding which critical

291
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:14,510
to you affordability included in the

292
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,440
image can be deployed in my state so if

293
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,990
it's potentially development stage or

294
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,080
testing stage I could allow high

295
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,730
critical ability for whatever reason no

296
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,230
please not for the production of wine

297
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:37,700
for the container engines needs to be

298
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:40,270
secured so someone is configuration of

299
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:47,350
that particle that's the engine itself

300
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:47,350
human ancestor if you are running your

301
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,900
container environment on friend you

302
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,330
still have a host which runs it which

303
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,150
needs to be secure for obvious reasons

304
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:02,080
as traditional service as well but

305
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:06,050
taking into account once containers

306
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,210
means or the container drivers is

307
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,750
running using containers in the public

308
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:15,050
clouds you need to secure container from

309
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:18,170
within that eks FASD KSR minute

310
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:21,919
and of course you need to monitor as

311
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:27,370
usual the container workloads

312
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:31,700
try running on trend or in the cloud so

313
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:35,600
to finalize it it is not enough to

314
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:39,630
secure containerized environment

315
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,168
on the right-hand side so the operations

316
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,330
[Music]

317
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:47,539
the operations you need to include

318
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,639
security from the beginning from the

319
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:53,059
coding potentially in the planning phase

320
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:57,830
as well and that makes it cheaper and

321
00:18:53,059 --> 00:19:00,320
more secure but the last slide with all

322
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,500
security with all of the requirements

323
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,210
about security it's about maintaining

324
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,260
the agility and enabling speed up

325
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:14,750
requirement in time to market and for

326
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:19,129
that we are using containers there was

327
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:22,669
CIT DS and 10 seconds life science or we

328
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,240
should at least use without getting in

329
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,980
the way

330
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,279
thank you

331
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,279
