1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,680
in theory the third time that's supposed

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,510
to be getting better by then so thank

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,239
you forgive me I think 20 minutes at the

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,290
time was about to start and there was a

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,850
long description of what I'm about to

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,410
tell you there with groanings

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,539
introduction inspires a few things for

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,960
me for thought I start with the whole

9
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,699
thing around movies bf machine smishing

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,949
fishing SMS fishing when you get the

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:32,800
text click on the Madison Chinese

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,059
medicine by Russian happen to me but the

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,279
one that in my mind was actually call

14
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:38,229
ahead America September time last year I

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,659
saw one agitated angry voice battle left

16
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:43,748
from a guy found it to be from HMRC and

17
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:45,248
Majesty's Revenue and Customs so saying

18
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:47,559
the basically all sort of things going

19
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:48,639
on my tax files lawsuits but it launched

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,879
against I needed to call them urgently

21
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:55,030
call them back they ignored the message

22
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,739
I then they phoned again many times

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,649
formed number was a passport for UK

24
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,269
number so they obviously have my mobile

25
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,119
again I ignored the message and being

26
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:06,220
somewhat aware I thought HMRC

27
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,050
and obviously to the mister it's a scam

28
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,580
as you expand phone up they say great

29
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,289
give us some detail to do all those good

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,090
things what I particularly enjoyed there

31
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,500
was the targeting profile that HMRC

32
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,420
shared because they said this is

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,340
typically age and the elderly and the

34
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,420
bone

35
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,560
so I said that I think you might fight

36
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,909
responded to them and madly in

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,490
cybersecurity about a pretty short

38
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,990
career so I'll explain there's a feeling

39
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,649
of talking a bit about some of the

40
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,429
things that the Jonathan mentioned

41
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,439
insecurity and a whole range of things

42
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,630
so obviously from a Palo Alto Networks

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,729
perspective I thought I started with

44
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,829
this and the concept of digital dog

45
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,360
wisdom is unkind for those who wait and

46
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,119
Ronan and you just gave a number of

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,520
examples of things and breaches and such

48
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,289
going on the leaving of keys on public

49
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,940
service is not the first time I'm sure

50
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,770
they're in this room right now

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,929
unknowingly giving things wide open in

52
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,950
public environments and such but also

53
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:59,170
the whole thing about digital

54
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,299
transformation digital disruption the

55
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,390
tension between organizations that need

56
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:06,369
to move fast the drive for IT and things

57
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,429
now to be part of revenue generation in

58
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,860
the business the perception the security

59
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,420
maybe a blogger or a barrier that's even

60
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,400
for those engaging security somewhere

61
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,569
during their design cycle because often

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,790
it's a bit at the end we need to launch

63
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,018
a service to come back and our security

64
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,760
now we're going to say there's lots of

65
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,400
problems with this or they just go live

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,590
anyway and they run the gauntlet and

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,450
ride the roller coaster and when people

68
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,040
look at all that the charm using one of

69
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,018
those people just things the cloud is a

70
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,679
great example everything moving to the

71
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:38,470
cloud I think I first came across the

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,780
the cast term caas at seven years ago

73
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,859
which is quite a service because

74
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,600
obviously so much of what's available

75
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:45,640
what's happening right now is Jenny

76
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,560
immediately available as a

77
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,819
off the dark web service knows ten and

78
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,890
thirty dollars to get a great customer

79
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,200
service downloading you know the malware

80
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,119
of choice and go exploiting drive so

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,649
it's incredibly easy all of the things

82
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,380
that we're trying to take advantage of

83
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,350
for scale agility and competitive

84
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,299
advantage in the cloud so in the other

85
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,970
guys so the guys with the dark masks and

86
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,730
search so this is just a just a fact and

87
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,590
the the pace to be moving is huge and

88
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,429
the paradigm is shifting is run instead

89
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,410
of the the interviews with massacre by

90
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,300
the you know by the embassy of the

91
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,070
Senate and also more recently the guys

92
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,630
from Google and otherwise as well and

93
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,950
just the fact that they're being asked

94
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,180
how can you run the business when you

95
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,488
don't really challenge anything and

96
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,050
these corny little Mark Zuckerberg specs

97
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,350
of you imagine if you ever saw any of

98
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:37,200
this

99
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:37,200
tiny which basically paraphrasing

100
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,200
and as well as the ball around data and

101
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,870
such types of data and records really so

102
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,100
what I want to do is go into the

103
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,410
security in the philosophy side of it

104
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,150
for a moment or two them so when what I

105
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,799
see no way you know is it as a as a

106
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,870
next-generation security company and

107
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,489
many ethnic in the room you look very

108
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,019
different types of technology deploying

109
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,640
and I think is easy to get ahead of

110
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,530
yourself and to believe that everyone's

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,238
in the next generation invading already

112
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,100
thinking further forward AI and she

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,209
learn all these great stands my

114
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,850
experience in talking to most

115
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,829
enterprises and most customers is that's

116
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,840
where the thinking and design may be but

117
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,940
the reality is a significant way behind

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,910
that and truth in fact many people have

119
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,560
bought next-generation technologies and

120
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,360
technologies through the classic things

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,770
where it seems to by tech then you

122
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,510
redeploy it to the place where we've had

123
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,400
young good times do the transformation

124
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:32,740
which is complex so you've got some

125
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,530
bigger fast to it in servers and

126
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,830
databases and other things ok insecurity

127
00:04:35,530 --> 00:05:30,409
the problem is what we do

128
00:04:36,830 --> 00:05:30,409
increasingly into a human issue the

129
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,400
scene somewhere and how we share that

130
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:09,150
but then particularly preventing new

131
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,679
threats and the sophistication there's

132
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,599
actually there's a lot to do in all of

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,000
this just the idea of whose ability ever

134
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,590
applications users content because it

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,510
used to be about ports and perimeters

136
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,710
and things but the world's changed you

137
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,120
know you look at the idea right now you

138
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,960
can't find a piece of malware you need

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,610
to look at that

140
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,020
there's an example to find out where

141
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,039
it's been because every type of area

142
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,719
come forward you want to be able to

143
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,099
block it within your environment because

144
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,990
your environment is not only one thing

145
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,250
your enterprise as lots of people most

146
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,810
likely these days traveling everywhere

147
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,370
with mobile devices and all those good

148
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,110
things there's a lot of you've got to

149
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,580
get a good expert in this space and

150
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,800
ultimately over time it's not something

151
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,030
that humans and can really do we need to

152
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,970
use the whole thing around machines

153
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,619
defied machines so when you look at the

154
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,599
web most most enterprises are right now

155
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,190
and when we see the old days that it was

156
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,378
nicely defined you area quarters that

157
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,870
the users and you had a firewall in the

158
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,400
perimeter that rivet is dead you know

159
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,409
what's happened now is we're consuming

160
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,770
things in so many different ways in the

161
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,090
cloud

162
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,549
we're in the cloud in some way we're

163
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,580
deploying things in Amazon AWS anybody

164
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,280
pound we're deploying with consuming

165
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,750
applications from the cloud box

166
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,008
yeah my Roberts priestly spine you know

167
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,659
you name those things of choice and many

168
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,159
people say we're not in the cloud until

169
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,930
you look at any one of their top ten

170
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:18,280
usable applications at least two or

171
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,080
three of them typically are chronically

172
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,460
and then of course building things in

173
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,258
the cloud but really here in the new

174
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,000
world we're gonna build and deploy in

175
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,740
the DevOps mentality the things that

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,349
many Amazon or as you or Google can give

177
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,729
its advantages and now you firmly in the

178
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,469
public cloud l'énergie all of their

179
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:33,909
infrastructure and you match something

180
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:36,880
else I think the roller mentioned around

181
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,130
there many customers hot you then get

182
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,650
caught in the shared security

183
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,090
responsibility which is Delvin secure

184
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,979
the cloud you know they'll be

185
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,479
responsible was guilty of it you're

186
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,789
responsible for your security in it

187
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,318
that's a critical distinction so that we

188
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:51,969
under no illusion any point in time but

189
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,259
the responsibility if your data what

190
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:55,779
happens to it later who accesses your

191
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,330
data everything is yours no matter where

192
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,009
you deploy so when you look at what used

193
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,270
to happen people would know go there's

194
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,819
any their current environment and they

195
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,560
starts deploying tools I need an

196
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,599
intrusion device here I need another

197
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,889
detection device in my cloud I mean the

198
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,050
intelligence the different part of my

199
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,969
environment and that in itself led to

200
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,310
proliferation of a Chinese you know some

201
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:19,569
more control arm you take the modern

202
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,830
world scale that out and now I'm trying

203
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:22,840
to deploy tools into environments I

204
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,789
didn't build into environments which the

205
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,719
infrastructure is identical in things

206
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:27,128
that are not great

207
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:28,419
actually one thing that hasn't changed

208
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,360
in all of this is the responsibility

209
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,889
still yours still belongs to your

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,169
company you're still the ones that we've

211
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:38,519
only minute me twelve hours 72 hours of

212
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,519
six months time in confessing to the

213
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,529
questions so where we're at is now

214
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,509
typically is in this a method in a place

215
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,800
where fragmentation is everywhere in the

216
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,689
in the enterprise both in terms of

217
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,609
infrastructure but it's very much in

218
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:53,889
terms of the security in the posture

219
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,689
association around at a comment process

220
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,459
is a very manual because the tools are

221
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:59,319
disparate so right now many cases the

222
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,209
tools and the correlation and the

223
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,189
coordination of those tools sits in the

224
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,279
users most original number of which we

225
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:08,800
can find and a very expensive departed

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:12,279
human error is key in all this human

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,540
judgments some of them the sake of

228
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,040
studies that we did this for their

229
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,110
security operating centers studies that

230
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
we did said in an average saw one

231
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,009
hundred seventy five thousand dollars a

232
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,579
week enough time and use to research

233
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:32,410
seven percent that he do the math

234
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:32,859
775,000 it's a lot and it really is not

235
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,420
gonna happen

236
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,949
so human error human judgment would come

237
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,569
into play there and then the whole thing

238
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:47,559
around you application architectures

239
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:49,029
like I see things into those areas so

240
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,490
we're grateful for were in a we're in

241
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,589
that battle we're in a battle where big

242
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,000
data starts to become come and play the

243
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,519
idea of visibility everywhere and

244
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,379
context in security becomes become super

245
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,639
important what the social media arrives

246
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:02,139
for Facebook's and these kind of guys

247
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,640
are doing taking all of our personal

248
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,440
days

249
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,720
really throw up every day using now to

250
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,700
target and profilers is effectively

251
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,500
happening in the network in lots of

252
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,790
different places the good news is that

253
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,560
Facebook has three billion dollars

254
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,300
roughly going in and delivering all of

255
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,770
our content from the enterprise

256
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,390
perspective you've got lots of disparate

257
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,770
things happening separately in lots of

258
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,670
different places do you need to somehow

259
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,840
be together it becomes leadership when

260
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,729
you look at the types of attacks that

261
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,560
are going on in reality as an industry

262
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,330
and I think in many cases some of the

263
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,209
known things we put pretty good of stock

264
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:37,980
we were pretty good at blocking we know

265
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,730
the terms certain things off even if we

266
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,560
do it by mistake

267
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,450
we know publicly access differed on the

268
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,650
web as a bad idea lots of things in

269
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,060
there and there are a number of

270
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,810
different ways of tools to stop some of

271
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,969
that but the further you get to the

272
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,319
right of this channel further you get to

273
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,110
the right of this chart and the warden

274
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,030
targeting profile it becomes one very

275
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,890
targeted social fishing the idea of

276
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,089
stealing the chief execs potentials and

277
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,980
doing things with man these things are

278
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,450
happening everyday they can be targeted

279
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,400
they can be slow and they can be really

280
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,400
sophisticated one of the ones I've had a

281
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,980
fairly enjoyed about to a degree was one

282
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,840
in a casino in the US where the breach

283
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,460
actually happened through the thermostat

284
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,590
and a fish tank that was on an S network

285
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,760
that was breached because most IOT

286
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,280
things occur pretty poor security

287
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,780
it was breached it was jumped from there

288
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,400
of the core network from there the

289
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,959
financial networks and command and

290
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,900
control things seen from the financial

291
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,390
systems of the casino you know from the

292
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,310
thermometer in the fish net so the

293
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,350
sophisticated attacks to take time and

294
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,939
otherwise and I think moving back to the

295
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,950
idea of national security nor the

296
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,450
Chinese banks and other businesses you

297
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,100
know one area that we see at the moment

298
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,860
around the concept of critical national

299
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,670
infrastructure so water supplies all

300
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,170
those kind of things

301
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,599
I don't want to give you doomsday

302
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,130
feelings but when you start to look at

303
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,450
what and then actually things mean in

304
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,220
those environments and there's a SCADA

305
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,230
and control environments is it right

306
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,980
that powers are going on 20 times I have

307
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,940
utility or wants everyone there

308
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,130
something's changing behaviors using

309
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,400
something moving it may warrant some

310
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,400
kind of

311
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,970
and when you look at the markets where

312
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,199
where teams are right now they tend to

313
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,660
be ad space staring at a bunch of

314
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,100
screens with a bunch of disparate tools

315
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,140
all flanking these alerts so there's my

316
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,580
twelve thousand others will be coming

317
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,990
lots of alerts are coming I need to look

318
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,430
at all sorts of different things take

319
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,860
the time I've got which is precious

320
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,689
anyway and there's got the where I was

321
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,430
finally gaps in between the screens here

322
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,610
and the gaps into thinking the captured

323
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,109
the policies in the gaps in the security

324
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,100
you know so you're asking to all sorts

325
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,040
things to go in here how do I

326
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,660
investigate something happened in his

327
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,400
network traffic masters I'll go there

328
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,900
I think it's directly going on this

329
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,120
users not something strange all these

330
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,370
things become different sets of data in

331
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,410
the current enterprise and we forced the

332
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,250
analysts to be the ones to bring it all

333
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:53,250
together it's more bang they're crazy

334
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,020
bright spots

335
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,279
so the world has changed and what a

336
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,449
fight machines with machines were in

337
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,529
that massive battle you've got to start

338
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,779
using the power of technology and

339
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,520
automation to bring that together that

340
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,660
really means the security context in

341
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,960
which data becomes one of the

342
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,550
foundations of making that success so

343
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,200
what we think the right approach is an

344
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,390
independent fully down into three

345
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,860
pillars great prevention so every place

346
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,420
that you can really can see something

347
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,950
and send something and monitor something

348
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,199
should also be a place where you can

349
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,020
take the opportunity to enforce some a

350
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,880
formal security posture that needs to be

351
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,030
dynamic it needs to be rapid it needs to

352
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,620
be responsive because machines move

353
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,880
quickly you're going to spin yourself up

354
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,260
a little server and Amazon right now

355
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,550
anyone in the room with your own credit

356
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,200
card without telling any of the friends

357
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,790
you do you'll meet somewhere between

358
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,920
three and seven seconds before the first

359
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,599
unauthorized brute-force - access

360
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,760
start coming quite often to Roman's

361
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,730
point through maybe the Far East type IP

362
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,339
addresses no it's all automated and up

363
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,930
so you need to be responsible at that

364
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:52,060
behavioral analytics as the attest it

365
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,130
more sophisticated from small reported

366
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,930
behavior of systems but missus area is

367
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,550
the favor of the users that the behavior

368
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:01,920
of systems as well anything that is

369
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,920
attaching to a network for instruction

370
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,569
and you would have this ability across

371
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,339
all of the layers across all of your

372
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,199
network across all than your endpoint

373
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,519
areas across the cloud in all those

374
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,660
different context and bring that

375
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,940
together maybe some kind of real-time

376
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,750
model in order to be able to take take

377
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,399
advantage and surprise to his pals

378
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,910
networks or say the good news is we

379
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:28,000
weren't wouldn't we have technology some

380
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,560
of which will be familiar with the

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,930
endpoint side maybe some of our cloud

382
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,760
technology bringing this all together in

383
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,479
a way that allows us to build a data

384
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,889
link results we pooled together

385
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,110
something we call the quartet States

386
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,089
base to the thinking Bailey massive

387
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,050
amounts of data millions of records

388
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,550
hundreds of millions of Records being

389
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,899
added every month into this the

390
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,740
correlation across 60,000 customer base

391
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,790
reading will add together into a way

392
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,260
that we can then start the correlate

393
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,779
sticks the data together in an automated

394
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,459
fashion so we can take the the constant

395
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,140
power and operating centers the

396
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:02,229
operating center worked and make that

397
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,939
easier to achieve and then really in all

398
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,980
of that integrating that back into those

399
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,260
network employment cloud points that one

400
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,320
sends duty news to read forensic lab

401
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,330
later

402
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,080
British texture responsible there's

403
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,940
things right away

404
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,830
so forensic level data but then

405
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,320
instantly owner take policy and we apply

406
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:24,240
into all or any of those points so this

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
is kind of fundamentally what we're

408
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,950
doing give an idea a little bit like

409
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,510
like this so in the campus and the Casa

410
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,310
campus or the main main area you may

411
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,290
have your the firewalls may actually

412
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,540
define parameters and things you control

413
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,459
in the branch and the robot office may

414
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,019
be using VPNs whether they need the

415
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,819
regular board of some kind of cloud gate

416
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,279
where they act at a point so for us to

417
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,019
make our local protective cloud service

418
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,480
on the endpoint we're using a

419
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,860
combination of thread level forensics on

420
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,720
the device along with machine learning

421
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,180
on the device and everything else

422
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,190
advanced real-time protection on the

423
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,019
endpoints themselves then he come into

424
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,970
the cloud virtual infrastructure virtual

425
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,250
firewalls in the cloud and integration

426
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,660
to the demo stack even down to container

427
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,769
level with security which so obviously

428
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,050
wants to follow up with deploying

429
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,579
services in the cloud way around that

430
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,469
being all that together into a

431
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,880
consistent telemetry point into the data

432
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,790
make so we can start to be very clever

433
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,250
things on top look at behavior posture

434
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,469
look at the commodity falls to track

435
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,670
things back right away to source because

436
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,320
that becomes very important you're

437
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,569
trying to work out where the weaknesses

438
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,579
and defenses are whether it's user

439
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,770
behavior keep clicking onto the phishing

440
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,109
emails etc bringing all that data

441
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,579
together gives us an opportunity to do a

442
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,170
number of a number of different things

443
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,729
but they're the critical thing in this

444
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,589
concept here right now is your automatic

445
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,029
station together the data it's not the

446
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,100
analyst staring at the six different

447
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,240
screens and being mindful to correlate

448
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,890
certain things themselves

449
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
bringing me together in a way with an

450
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,370
interface that means they can track

451
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
things excessively quickly and also to

452
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,600
some extent we can automate based on

453
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,910
what we are comfortable to do we can

454
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,649
automate the actual reaction of our

455
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,079
infrastructure to deploy security in

456
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,760
real time so something happen we know

457
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,529
who's blog that who that user turn that

458
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,709
cloud access piece off and by the way is

459
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:06,449
secure

460
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:12,599
automatic not necessarily human user

461
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:16,650
behavior direction so kind of this build

462
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,750
this build this out so this is the

463
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,280
horizontal aroni game of someone someone

464
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,809
gets their fishing mayochamp it's the

465
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,819
fishing whale having to click comment

466
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,170
you know took you to a web browser web

467
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,000
browser meanwhile is downloading the

468
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,950
malware or maybe the father's tile

469
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,780
attack files type of attack that started

470
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,580
to grow eraser some kind of external

471
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,170
connection good news is the files are

472
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,520
locked it normally would happen in

473
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,750
security is that the file will garage

474
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,000
potatoes something got in the file

475
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,010
that's good buddy engineer other stuff

476
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,250
to go to this node takes all the way we

477
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,010
regulate balances hmm maybe this is the

478
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,780
user training to do human smiler things

479
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,910
need to look at all of this done

480
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,240
effectively actionable integrated in

481
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,370
real time at the parent has the team all

482
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,350
of this using the firewall the endpoint

483
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,659
all those technologies deployed as a

484
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,010
platform so we get time to acts and we

485
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,929
really get it causality which when you

486
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,879
come to GDP are better how to achieve

487
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,590
compliance in how I respond I got less

488
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:17,580
shortened on window to respond if

489
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:18,899
something has to mean time to detect I

490
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,149
think he's still around about five

491
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,470
months in most enterprises right now so

492
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,820
this is a way to rapidly shitty tax so

493
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,470
I'm going to just kind of wrap it up in

494
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,360
the last I've got here so complex

495
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,770
diagram of the public cloud all the

496
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,510
different sensors and places that we

497
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,530
deploy technologies be they firewalls

498
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,730
and security all the things that we

499
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,928
bring those together when as soon as

500
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,080
things on there the way of trying

501
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:48,150
summarizes to you is to come back to the

502
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,159
the four philosophies of their security

503
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,110
complete visibility everywhere for that

504
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,520
you need to deploy some form of

505
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,320
assistive technology across all of those

506
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,320
areas so they can work together to start

507
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,270
we do that with all of the devices that

508
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,770
we fight they find that all the things

509
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,240
that we deploy a both senators and

510
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,410
points application bring the life

511
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,570
together and pray that they delay

512
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,160
normalize that so we can use it for a

513
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,810
variety of different things and then

514
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,610
security becomes about smart our wardens

515
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,679
well I see here some of those will be

516
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,540
asked some of those will not be asked

517
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,610
that the cortex model where this thing

518
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,560
we call the cortex hub and what that is

519
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,209
is an open effectively open to third

520
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,399
party application providers at which we

521
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,380
working with about 30 right now and 11th

522
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,910
currently posted applications to the hub

523
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,800
to do very different things

524
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,030
leveraging the visibility and the

525
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,409
residuals the infrastructure and the

526
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,360
intelligence to drive something new

527
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,310
medical devices to the chemical medicaid

528
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,679
going into the hospital going to put no

529
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,000
detectable price hours of the different

530
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,650
things coming to environment and

531
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,690
building policy around those through an

532
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,060
IOT item ICS car the tax department

533
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,370
cyber X they go and specialize in all of

534
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,129
the the IOT and control system side of

535
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,750
things leveraging all the things we do

536
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:01,290
one of the biggest problems in most

537
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:02,940
enterprises is so we can go and do this

538
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,270
if it's a great idea where should I

539
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,010
deploy it everywhere that's pretty tough

540
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,810
pretty expensive well this does is

541
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,610
shipped it to be an application so the

542
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,230
cortex hub model fundamentally means

543
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,909
we'll deploy the operating platform

544
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,770
we've got some small things that we did

545
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,080
we know we're not the only smart guys in

546
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,910
town think of this is the app store the

547
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,280
security for the future and the ability

548
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,380
to consume in a motion at pace my

549
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,899
security respected non-destructively

550
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,670
into an environment that's the modern

551
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,440
world I think aware of west acuity comes

552
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,140
all about to come and Robin is common

553
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,640
policy and common reporting so we're

554
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,310
working with organizations around all

555
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,940
this many gates libraries to that I

556
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,590
mentioned record in future others that

557
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,580
you may or may not know that a part of

558
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,280
various and things in the environment

559
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,260
and about 2000

560
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,730
innovating in security right now we're

561
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,020
trying to build a substantial platform

562
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,970
on top of which they can get leverage

563
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,470
because in most enterprises the

564
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,630
deployment of the sensory structures

565
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,040
it's only problem but how to make that

566
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,960
make that expandable an extensible

567
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,260
future so work with companies all around

568
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,030
is from our perspective is to close up I

569
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,260
think the only way to find them back

570
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,200
from the futures machines with machines

571
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,820
the only way so we control back in your

572
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,590
environment control back in beyond in

573
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,480
the cost protocol environment it's use

574
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,800
some form of operating platform we can

575
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,570
get greater leverage of terms for any

576
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,370
investment that you make and over time

577
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,200
start to bring down normalize that cost

578
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,540
of Defense is the cost of offense is

579
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,800
going down every day that's the

580
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,820
challenge or the cost of offense is

581
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,680
going down every day we need to

582
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,659
normalize that so lots of things in here

583
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,490
and the financial mechanical platform

584
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,760
approach a platform capability makes

585
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,680
sense so you know in a nutshell I would

586
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,830
say based on moments we share this hope

587
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,470
and talk about you know focus on those

588
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,820
four pillars of security and really know

589
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,010
your posture should be around these

590
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,060
things Prevention's right say focus on

591
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,310
it it's ultimately what you need to

592
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,179
achieve automatically attention rapid

593
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,159
investigation

594
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,930
pull those things and a very automated

595
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,850
authority the response and attachment

596
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:58,160
process in order to create a compelling

597
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,780
and hopefully ongoing security with that

598
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,260
model that says and other innovators can

599
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,330
come and leverage that too so access

600
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,580
I'll say thank you very much it's kind

601
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,439
we will be here some of the team here

602
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,699
today so we'll be outside so they will

603
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,380
have a chance to be some of you guys

604
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,220
later on during the day enjoy the rest

605
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,799
of your day

606
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,799
[Applause]
