1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:11,160
good morning and welcome to zero the

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,620
economy this is our or v zero daikon we

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,139
got acclaimed flies and it's return

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,790
Ireland after very successful zero

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,820
daikon which we ran in Washington DC

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,590
back in October and today we've got a

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,830
tremendous lineup of industry

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,330
professionals keynote speakers and

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,668
panelists we're gonna give you guys

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,579
their perspectives and their insights

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,440
into being in the industry and they're

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,829
gonna share with you their view are in

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,089
the service Kira's landscape the

14
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,739
disruptive technologies which were

15
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:46,980
seeing coming down the tracks to

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,230
influence digital transformation the

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,059
regulatory environment and how that's

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,498
gonna affect your business and of course

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,858
be the security risk that affects us as

20
00:00:55,499 --> 00:01:02,609
individuals that affects business owners

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,320
and indeed that affects those of you who

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,969
are empowered to protect your

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:12,089
organization's structure and to protect

24
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:15,449
our people from cyberattacks and from

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,340
cyber criminals in the evening we have

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,680
our afternoon water we have our

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,030
technical tracks and that will provide a

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,829
more intimate environment for networking

29
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,229
with your peers and also for asking

30
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,919
questions of the taught leaders who will

31
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,990
be running those individual sessions but

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,700
one of the things I like to do at every

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,469
zero their con is I like to maybe

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,420
reflect I think I've only got a couple

35
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:42,179
of minutes but reflect on some of the

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,720
talking points that we've seen from the

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,490
year before and my goodness it has

38
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,009
if we look at it from what we lost at

39
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,048
zero they come here last year in a smart

40
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,899
tech we walked the coalface excitement

41
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,880
security we can see the good the bad and

42
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,020
the the really ugly part of the industry

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,929
as of old I guess if we were to solve a

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,890
lot we would say that we see a

45
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,840
significant increase in the

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,929
sophistication of spear phishing attacks

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,300
on on on individuals and on on

48
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,310
organizations and that's primarily been

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,790
driven by the bad guys ability to

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,220
nybridge a IEM to leverage the amount of

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,429
data that's readily available on the

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,850
dark web the consequence of successful

53
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,880
spear fishing is that you tend to see a

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,280
lot of business email compromised that

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,790
tends to lead to things like invoice

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,980
fraud redirection and it also tends to

57
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,620
lead to pretty serious incidents of

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,619
ransomware attacks since the beginning

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,830
of this year we have been contacted by

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,680
or 20 companies internationally from

61
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,540
Australia to North America to Europe

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,150
who've been victims of ransomware

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,160
attacks it's a horrible situation find

64
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,510
yourself in and the type of ransomware

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,970
that they're being hit with it's not as

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,519
high profile as patch or wanna cry but

67
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,280
the consequences are just as devastating

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,170
and this is ransomware targets your file

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,209
shares the targets your data backup and

70
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,339
a lot of these companies are letting

71
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,040
completely impotent in terms of trying

72
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,100
to undress you then enter into a process

73
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,280
where you have to negotiate with Russian

74
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,200
extortionists

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,819
you end up provisioning Bitcoin which is

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,679
a pretty painful exercise and

77
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,358
transferring incredible amounts of money

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,959
to these guys in the hope that you get

79
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:31,170
your decryption keys back so the

80
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,079
industry dddd standard type challenges

81
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,388
are not going away we've also had to

82
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,100
make it reaches and in these mega

83
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,769
breaches you've all probably heard of

84
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,108
Star Wars or marriage and in that

85
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,590
particular breach it was really 300 and

86
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,150
500 million

87
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,489
passport details were stolen and

88
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,190
customer details it was an interesting

89
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,140
breach because of the nation that was

90
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,810
stolen it was five million passport

91
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,329
details that were unencrypted and then

92
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,840
it was 20 million that were encrypted so

93
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,120
Marietta done a good job except Mary had

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,640
left the decryption keys for that data

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,230
on the same server so the inviting the

96
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,619
bag going straight to the cookie jar

97
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,629
opened up and said helped herself what

98
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,370
was also interesting about Marriott is

99
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:19,039
that they're obviously commercially

100
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,168
commercial organization but it looks

101
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:24,770
like it was a state-sponsored attack and

102
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:29,960
in this case it was all fingers point to

103
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:32,780
China in addition with Mario's what if

104
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,150
we Illustrated to everyone is that cyber

105
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,989
crime and cyber attacks they're no

106
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:42,370
longer just a technical challenge there

107
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,470
are no also a financial challenge and

108
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,870
when organizations get hit with a cyber

109
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,270
attack we live in an era where hedge

110
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,400
funds and institutional investors are

111
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,560
watching for their ability to respond to

112
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,960
these attacks and in the case of Mario's

113
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,760
within two hours of the attack being

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,280
announced and the bridge disclosure of

115
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,889
coming out their shared place dropped by

116
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,539
10 percent and of course people will

117
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,270
argue that the share price will bounce

118
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:13,669
back in the most cases it does but I

119
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,500
wonder how often the people who are

120
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,539
involved at the helm in terms of the

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,020
breach I wonder often their careers

122
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:23,400
bounced back we also had a AG group on

123
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,969
British Airways

124
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,909
of that that that bridge was trimmer

125
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,449
made thousand users of those 380,000

126
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,930
users the hack was was was sophisticated

127
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,400
enough it was a type of skimming and it

128
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:43,410
affected anyone in between the 21st of

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,349
September and October 5th who transacted

130
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,300
on British Airways website what was

131
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,840
really interesting about this case was

132
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,270
that it was in the era of GDP are so

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,159
British Airways didn't even take the 72

134
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,560
hours they just came clean within a day

135
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,510
and said look we've been hit and it's

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,210
pretty sensitive information so your

137
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,860
payment details and for everyone that

138
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,250
was affected they didn't have to contact

139
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,770
Iceland and cancel their credit cards

140
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,000
and get them reissued and British

141
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,960
Airways dealt with it in terms of the

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,030
information is shared

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,919
it's questionable but at least they came

144
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,179
clean because if you look at all of the

145
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,099
breaches that took place over the last

146
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,910
three months six months nine months

147
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,669
lot of organizations never disclosed the

148
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,789
bleach so it shows that GT pure is

149
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,789
working but unfortunately farm I AG

150
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,889
group their share place as well took a

151
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,190
hit and dropped by five percent

152
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,990
unannounced went off the bridge

153
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,450
we've also had the circus with our tech

154
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,060
joints the googles and the Facebook's of

155
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,550
this world we see the first regulator

156
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,820
internationally in France the ANC saw

157
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,220
flexor muscles an issue detect join evil

158
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,639
with 50 million dollar fine fretted

159
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,280
alleged data privacy abuse it'll be

160
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,720
interesting to see other places and I

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,369
think this iconic photo of Mark

162
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Zuckerberg in Congress really

163
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,280
illustrates the profound problem that

164
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,909
the world faces when it comes to social

165
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,830
media what struck me about this was the

166
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,979
incredible discrepancy in the knowledge

167
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,349
base between the senators who were

168
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:21,030
interrogating Merrick in Congress and a

169
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,280
complete lack of understand

170
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,739
and Facebook generates revenue will

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,900
monetize the data which we voluntarily

172
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,430
serve up to them and the consequences of

173
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,340
nation states to influence the

174
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,340
geopolitical agenda in the u.s. in

175
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:42,479
Britain in mainland Europe is a scary

176
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,969
total we don't have the Mission

177
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,530
Impossible stuff

178
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,890
genuinely likely to come out of a movie

179
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:53,700
and it's where we see the attack on the

180
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:56,820
supply chain the big story of last year

181
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,099
was the Bloomberg story on super micro

182
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,940
was it a hoax or was it a hack we don't

183
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:06,150
know what we do know is that Amazon and

184
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,030
Apple had come out they stringently

185
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,979
denied that it's happened

186
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,380
typically bloomer wouldn't be associated

187
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,290
with fake news but they stopped by their

188
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:20,460
story so I do believe there's more to

189
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:24,000
play out in that we also have hollowing

190
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,359
which is the fascinating story and if if

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,960
you're following the the this story on

192
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,450
social media in the news it's getting

193
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,179
more and more interesting as the days go

194
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,550
by there's a doesn't does erase

195
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,030
internationally by organizations to roll

196
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:44,790
out 5g and a Huawei is a Chinese

197
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:48,270
business which has gone from the world's

198
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:51,089
largest telecommunication

199
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,370
how always acquitted and occupies every

200
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,070
step of the network chain between our

201
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,590
laptops and our phones treating the data

202
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,740
centers within the content which we want

203
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:05,580
to access although it says user devices

204
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,940
to its core business as network switches

205
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,030
gateways routers and bridges dedicated

206
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,150
that controls how and where data is sent

207
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:18,270
and this is the equipment that's causing

208
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:20,340
all of the force these infrastructure

209
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,260
devices touched every traverse in the

210
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,310
International and are critical to

211
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,270
function properly

212
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,829
as Huawei is the biggest player in what

213
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,949
is a critical part of modern

214
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,150
infrastructure it is an obvious and

215
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,890
necessary catalyst for scrutiny and

216
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,010
unfortunately that scrutiny for Huawei

217
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,290
is not going well

218
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:46,850
Western security officials have been

219
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:49,860
especially where China's foreign policy

220
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,490
including its alleged ambitions to use

221
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,130
business targets in foreign countries as

222
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,589
elements of warfare much of this

223
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,620
wariness can trace its origins back to a

224
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:05,010
book that was written in 1999 by two

225
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,990
Chinese Air Force squadrons the book

226
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,110
which was translated into English as

227
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,940
unrestricted warfare and is great the

228
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,690
strategy needed to win a conflict

229
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:19,500
against the US it for religious the idea

230
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,440
that non-military means can be used to

231
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,110
challenge a regulation including

232
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,150
attacking telecommunications

233
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,860
infrastructure our networks or what we

234
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,560
might call a cyber war academics and war

235
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,530
experts have suggested that the

236
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,060
translation title is more incendiary and

237
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:45,060
that the original Chinese face phrase

238
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,430
could be considered to be more fair

239
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,268
beyond boundaries but the assumed

240
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,209
sentiment has

241
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,070
Western thinking about with network

242
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,910
equipment could potentially facilitate

243
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,279
espionage

244
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,399
all the world has not been detected in

245
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,709
doing so any evidence would mean a mass

246
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,649
withdrawal of the technology globally it

247
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:08,079
would have to be a similarly time action

248
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:10,089
this has prompted the concern that the

249
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,069
equipment could be made not function by

250
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,089
the company or the Chinese government

251
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,760
essentially to take down

252
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,040
telecommunications infrastructure during

253
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,550
a time of international crisis and such

254
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,130
a move would inevitably compound crisis

255
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,250
and potentially have a critical damaging

256
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:31,360
impact on the West's ability to respond

257
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:35,440
to Beijing's actions in terms of looking

258
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,209
forward I think we've got a fight - -

259
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,829
some other time but defying five areas

260
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,839
in the report to look at assess the

261
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:43,930
cybersecurity industry with a tremendous

262
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,820
skills shortage it's estimated in the

263
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,310
region of two to three minimum fill the

264
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,589
vacancies by 2020 with a tremendous

265
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,319
diversity problem we do not have another

266
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,360
female as editor in cybersecurity and it

267
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,670
rolls the technical rules we see people

268
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,620
move into other industries here we're

269
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,199
seeing significant advances in

270
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,579
artificial intelligence bought on the

271
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,010
good side in the back side with

272
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:08,829
companies are innovating and delivering

273
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,020
incredible capabilities we also see the

274
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,189
bad guys innovating and the innovation

275
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,819
that they're doing is leading to

276
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:18,310
successful breaches within organizations

277
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,140
but 2023 forty percent of all teams will

productivity we're seeing an accelerated

281
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,079
in digital transformation and we're

282
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,360
seeing organizations driving operational

283
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:34,810
efficiency by adopting clouds to

284
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,390
accelerate the business and to 2020 at

285
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,279
least 85 percent of cloud security

286
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,920
failures will be the customers fault

287
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,079
that moves back to organizations trying

288
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,240
to drive the business faster utilize

289
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,779
cloud but not having these technical

290
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,449
skills and resources they

291
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,519
we're singing baby please in all k9 CSD

292
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:55,319
attack services increasing and we're

293
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,500
seeing organizations trying to secure

294
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:00,029
that way to attack surface and then

295
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,149
we're seeing a profound we're changing

296
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,350
already a tree environment we're seeing

297
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,220
primarily because of what we've seen

298
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,220
with Facebook

299
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,929
