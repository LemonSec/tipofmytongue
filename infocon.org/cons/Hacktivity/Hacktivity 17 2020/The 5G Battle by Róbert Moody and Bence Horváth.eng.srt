00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,280
hello everyone thank you so much for

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,080
joining our talk today the 5g battle

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,120
we're really looking forward to

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,519
presenting this topic to you a big shout

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,480
out to our hosts

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
it's been a really great event now we're

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,679
in day three

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,160
so let's kick right off into it my name

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,440
is robert moody i'm a threat

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,439
intelligence officer at one of the large

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,880
telcos in germany

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,039
my co-host is pence horvath i'll give

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
him a chance to introduce himself

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
hello everybody my name is spence

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,439
horvath i'm a

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,160
director at a large global consultancy

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
responsible for next-gen security

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,079
operations

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,200
and the advanced security

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,440
testing subpractice as part of our

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
technology consulting

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
cyber practice so let's

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
kick into our presentation um

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
with the deployments of the

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
5g infrastructure in the past really the

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,680
past

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,039
year or so we have seen the rise of

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,479
a quite unique threat landscape

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,799
um that's a bit different from what

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,080
we've seen by

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
telcos previously

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
and when robert and i have analyzed um

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,439
the threat landscape we have managed to

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,159
basically

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
group uh the major actors into

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
three pillars or you know buckets

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
the first group would be the counter 5g

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
activists these are

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
usually propped up by conspiracy

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,920
theories

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
and these are the same groups spreading

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
questionable information or direct

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,280
misinformation

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,320
online most of them have

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,960
a roots in in previous

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,920
conspiracy theories as well

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
well-established ones so these are the

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
same people who would be

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
um riling up against uh

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,680
anything from microwave radiation to

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,719
chemtrails

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,639
previously and now they switched on

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,200
to 5g either because of the newness of

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
the technology and

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,040
the lack of understanding or what we

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
have been able to

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
uncover is organized disinformation

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
campaigns

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
um supporting and sort of fanning the

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
flames of these

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
country 5g activists encounter 5g

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
movements

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,440
the second group that we've

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
pulled together our pillar would be your

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,360
traditional

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,000
high threat actors your your

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,160
nation-state-backed apts or very very

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
well organized and credible

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
and capable organized client groups or

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,239
ocgs

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,800
who would target the telecommunication

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,360
and

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,239
the high-tech sector working for

74
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,200
telecommunications companies

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,319
you know providing either equipment so

76
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
the equipment manufacturers or software

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,159
solutions or in any combination

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,920
of those and their goals

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
are are largely either political

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
diplomatic or the traditional signals

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,879
intelligence so trying to gain

82
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,920
unauthorized access to these networks

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,360
for monitoring perspectives so being

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
able to listen into

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
calls or data flows on the networks

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
capture them and excel trade them

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
or monetary gains so we

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,519
especially for ocgs of course

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,120
this is potentially a quite lucrative

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
endeavor to try and access a critical

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
communications network

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
such as telcos and either

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,920
ransom the network or threatened to

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,720
release

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,799
information anything from you know

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
snippets of capture traffic to

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
subscriber information the world

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
and the third group is

99
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,280
we label them as traditional corporate

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
espionage these actors are primarily

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
aimed at stealing

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
new technologies so as we've talked

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,079
before

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,839
5g is really a new technology

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
the this is really the equipment

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
manufacturers

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
in this space the largest ones are are

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
only a handful and they're located

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
in southeast asia or northern europe so

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
there is

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
a virtual arms race going on between

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
you know technology providers as well as

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
between telecommunication

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,400
as well to have access to newest and

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,720
latest and the best of technologies

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,290
as well as

117
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,080
[Music]

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
really experiences and and

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
methods to build up 5g networks

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
across the countries bench you're

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
absolutely spot on with that

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
to add on to that point the way in which

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
some of the

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
emerging groups and those those two main

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
categories you're describing the

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
european and the

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
southeast asian basically producers of

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
5g technology

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
are also working with the telcos and

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,880
then

131
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,840
other groups to apply this 5g technology

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,960
so

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
there's a lot of news in europe about

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
the big automakers working with 5g to

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,639
have smarter cars work with

136
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,400
some of the manufacturing groups to have

137
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
smart facilities

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
there comes a lot of benefit in stealing

139
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,000
this information to whether

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
reproduce it in a country that doesn't

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
quite have as advanced

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,360
manufacturing process or advanced

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
technology as well as the ability to

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
sell it like bench mentioned on the dark

145
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,000
web

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,919
yes so going into the groups the first

147
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,280
one that we mentioned

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
are the anti-5g sort of conspiracy

149
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
movement and and really it's it's what

150
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,039
we've seen is

151
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,160
uh a form of activism

152
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
online mainly propped up by various

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,440
social media networks you

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,680
one of those more affordable ones such

155
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
as facebook and twitter

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,840
or the more underground ones this

157
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
is 4chan and 8chan um where

158
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
disinformation and this information

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,840
is is really spreading like wildfire

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
there are

161
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,080
interesting um subsets let's call it

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,880
this way

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
of anti-5g conspiracy theories

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,479
a an alarming number of them

165
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
are connected connecting the new 5g

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,479
technologies to the global pandemic of

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,720
covet 19

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,599
largely because it has appeared at the

169
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,960
same time

170
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,840
but also because this new technology is

171
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
of course

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,039
being seen as something

173
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
that's potentially um dangerous and

174
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,840
and unknown and we know that you know

175
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,880
us as as as humans we we tend to fear

176
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,680
the unknown

177
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
and and things that we don't understand

178
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,039
so

179
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,199
um those links establishing between

180
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
uh 5g and coronavirus are

181
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,800
very weak and very

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
require a leap of faith in logic i would

183
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,360
say or

184
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
to to understand but

185
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,720
what is interesting for us is that we

186
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
have seen

187
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,680
some of these campaigns pop

188
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
up organically and spread organically

189
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
through the social networks

190
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,720
but we have also seen um evidences

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,400
of these groups being

192
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,680
uh organized by really

193
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
you know advanced methods in that

194
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
disinformation

195
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
and misinformation and actors who would

196
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,360
otherwise be active in

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,599
manipulation and misinformation on the

198
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,560
internet

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
would use also 5g groups

200
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,280
as well to uh you know

201
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
saw more chaos and and feed the

202
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,280
as we'll see some uh later sometimes

203
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
quite

204
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
literal flames of um

205
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,000
of discontent um in this space

206
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,519
again spot on bence and again

207
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,080
correlation does not mean causation and

208
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
the leap of faith you're talking about

209
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,240
is

210
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,880
being underpinned by some of the most

211
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,519
interesting

212
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,760
pseudo science i've ever read when you

213
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
start going on to

214
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
some of the change.org petitions and

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,640
reading

216
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,560
why 5g is causing corona or why 5g

217
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
is causing illness in children the

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
elderly

219
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
and animals i think there was a

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,080
big press release around birds exploding

221
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
in the sky around 5g towers and

222
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
turned out to be somebody was a really

223
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
bad person and going out and poisoning

224
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,279
the animals and

225
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,440
it just happened to be a 5g tower was

226
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
there and then

227
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
there's some of the theories same

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,000
because

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
5g went to wuhan and then um cove it

230
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,959
happened then kovit was created because

231
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,760
of 5g

232
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
it's it's just the logical acrobats

233
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
that some of these individuals are doing

234
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,480
is

235
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,240
is amazingly awful um but

236
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
yeah it has been mentioned that fire in

237
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
flames you can see

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
a burnt tower here

239
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,120
um yeah so as as i mentioned previously

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
unfortunately these conspiracy theories

241
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,560
have crossed

242
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,160
um the threshold from purely being

243
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,440
in the online and digital realms to

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
um do you protest in the

245
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
very physical real world and even

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,279
these protests have turned on to being

247
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,760
either

248
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
violent clashes with the police or what

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,279
we've seen

250
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,320
in germany in the uk and netherlands as

251
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
well as in the us

252
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
and some other countries as well is that

253
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,680
they have turned their anger

254
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
into actual destruction of uh

255
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
5g infrastructure and this is where we

256
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,800
have seen

257
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,160
um evidences of

258
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,959
you know organized uh misinformation and

259
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,800
disinformation campaigns

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
as we mentioned this this is

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
this is a rather new technology and

262
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
technical blueprints

263
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,399
are rather scarce i would say online

264
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,959
that are

265
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,959
available for just your average joe and

266
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,000
jill

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
but we have seen groups being

268
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,800
supplied with this information and

269
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,079
being organized very very well in

270
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,959
trying to hit and disable these

271
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,880
telecommunication towers

272
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,240
um with uh with an almost alarming

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
efficiency robert you have some

274
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
experience unfortunately in dealing with

275
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,000
this

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,959
absolutely working in a telco you hear

277
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,720
things and i know collaborating with

278
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
some of the other operators in germany

279
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
uh anti-5g 5g news is

280
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
really important to the board it's

281
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
gotten to be the point where this is so

282
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
newsworthy that um

283
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
your c levels are starting to ask

284
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
questions about this is

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,279
are we seeing this is this a danger for

286
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
us or should we be worried about our

287
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,839
technology

288
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
and even non-5g towers are being

289
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
attacked because

290
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
again the people that believe that 5g is

291
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
causing corona

292
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
also believe the world is flat and

293
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
vaccines are bad for you

294
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,519
so they're not the greatest experts when

295
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,480
it comes to

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
the difference between a 4g and a 5g

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
tower

298
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
there are cases where like in the uk

299
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,200
they slap 5g stickers on the 5g towers

300
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,480
that's a little bit more of a direct

301
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
marketing campaign that backfired when

302
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,680
those those towers were attacked but yes

303
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,240
uh

304
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,519
it's very highly prevalent also

305
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,320
in terms of news there back in april i

306
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
think it was the 25th or 26th

307
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,440
it was international anti-5g day there

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,079
was

309
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,040
protests being organized in the uk in

310
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
london

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in germany and berlin and in other

312
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,120
places across the board and

313
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
this is really scary for for a business

314
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,040
so when you have to start thinking about

315
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,959
do i need to protect my workers do i

316
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
need to protect my infrastructure

317
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
what is the monetary cost that can

318
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
result from these types of news stories

319
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
yes and unfortunately in the uk as well

320
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
we have had

321
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,519
several stories of uh you know

322
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
verbal and and almost physical abuse of

323
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
telco workers not even just installing

324
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,279
5g equipment

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
which as you mentioned the stickers were

326
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,440
on

327
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,480
on the uh on the towers trying to

328
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
you know used by that particular telco

329
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
company to

330
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
promote 5g coverage but also

331
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,600
we've seen workers putting in you know

332
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
cables in the grounds that would lead to

333
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,360
towers

334
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
being harassed by people and

335
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
and verbally abused and physically

336
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,959
threatened with abuse

337
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,279
so that they would stop their work so

338
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,680
this is unfortunately very much

339
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,959
uh a front agenda for uh

340
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,000
telco you know c-level leadership as you

341
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,279
mentioned

342
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
but let's go a little bit deeper into

343
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,119
the the

344
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
the use of this activist actors

345
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
and what tools techniques and procedures

346
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,839
do they use

347
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
so all throughout our analysis we have

348
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,600
relied on the

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
mitre attack framework to sort of create

350
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
a um an easy to use

351
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,920
visual matrix that we can present

352
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,639
to a variety of stakeholders a variety

353
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,480
of stakeholders can use

354
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
to better understand and you know

355
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
defend deter or deny the activities of

356
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,639
these various

357
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,920
actor groups robert you want to delve

358
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
into the activist lunch

359
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,680
absolutely um so using mitre we

360
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
we wanted to make it so that when you

361
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
look at these tactics and techniques you

362
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,160
can

363
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,079
uh hand it over to different security

364
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
teams so it's not just intelligence

365
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
exercise it's not just a security

366
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
operation exercise or a red team

367
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
exercise or white team exercise

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
we really wanted to categorize the way

369
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
in which uh the different

370
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
categories in the beginning we mentioned

371
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,800
the high tech

372
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
the espionage and the activists the way

373
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,199
in which they function and operate in a

374
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,639
common lexicon

375
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
so deep diving into the activists we

376
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,279
framed it a little bit differently than

377
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
we did the other two

378
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,440
this is more around some of the tactical

379
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,399
efforts they make

380
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,600
so creating a priority definition and

381
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
putting the planning together they make

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
a strategic plan of how they're going to

383
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
go about it

384
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
when you see some of the more organized

385
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,440
disinformation campaigns

386
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,959
there's a lot of structure and

387
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,519
leadership around these efforts because

388
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
there's a bigger play at hand when you

389
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,360
get the priority definition direction

390
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,440
you start to build out the specific

391
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
tasks for each of the members of the

392
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,399
group so

393
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,680
who's going to be in charge of social

394
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,839
media are we involved

395
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,880
state news what type of articles need to

396
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,000
be published

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,920
what type of celebrity faces do we need

398
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
to involve

399
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
once we once we have that type of plan

400
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
and playbook in place

401
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
it goes to more of the target selection

402
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
so where in the region or

403
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,279
do you want to go after do you want to

404
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
go after telcos in germany do you want

405
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
to go to telcos in the netherlands the

406
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,920
uk

407
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
the us where is your target

408
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
so and then once you have your target

409
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,360
you decide how you're going to go about

410
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,199
each of the campaigns you tailor that

411
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,480
for them

412
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
you begin the information gathering so

413
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,920
this is you

414
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,079
start trying to plan and understand your

415
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:22,959
adversary

416
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,759
in a sense so this is um what type of

417
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,680
technical information is there

418
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,040
uh things on linkedin facebook

419
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
is there people information so who are

420
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,240
the major players in the organization

421
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,839
some of the more organized campaigns you

422
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,440
see docs you know releasing of

423
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,639
information on

424
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,680
important members of of telco so this

425
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,480
the ceo

426
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
or the co or you start to see this as

427
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,320
means to rile up the masses

428
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,880
you also then go to identify weaknesses

429
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,519
in your adversary so

430
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,759
who um who's the best target in the

431
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,600
organization to go after

432
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
can you tie this back to any of the big

433
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
initiatives is there other geopolitical

434
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
things going on that you can tie it back

435
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,839
to

436
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,839
a big one here is kovit some of the more

437
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,439
organized campaigns

438
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,640
tied these 5g release to the virus

439
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
that's affecting all of us today and

440
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,720
when

441
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
people are scared it's a really good

442
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,520
weakness to exploit on

443
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
this type of activity so then once you

444
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,280
have all your information and your

445
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
weaknesses identified

446
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,080
the more advanced groups conducting

447
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
these types of activism

448
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
they perform up sex so they try to cover

449
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,200
their tracks

450
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
but more of the organic ones that bench

451
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,400
mentioned earlier

452
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
it's more a free-for-all these people

453
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
are happy to have their faces and names

454
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
put on it because

455
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
they believe they're doing a social

456
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,960
justice or a good

457
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
it's it's their set of beliefs that

458
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,240
drive them

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,679
so very similarly with

460
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
activists who are going against big

461
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,960
companies

462
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
they believe they're in the right so

463
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
that's why they go after these groups

464
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,400
so then once they have the opsec if

465
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
you're the more advanced groups

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
they start to build the infrastructure

467
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,520
or network so a lot of them

468
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
use change.org and other petition sites

469
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
to build their message facebook groups

470
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,720
are a big way to

471
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
to foster a following or foster a group

472
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
of people that will support you they'll

473
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,320
march

474
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
you start to build agendas and days like

475
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
the anti-5g day international which is

476
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,640
very

477
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
interesting i guess with the set of

478
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
requirements and then

479
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
you always leave that open-ended nature

480
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
of do anything you like to help

481
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
support the cause which that can lead to

482
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,080
the burnt towers we saw

483
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,280
a few slides back uh once you have all

484
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
of that in place you start

485
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
um testing your capabilities do you go

486
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
after the towers in a physical sense

487
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,039
do you start to um identify other

488
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,320
targets and other people

489
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
in in the space that's the pseudo

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
science space especially around 5g who

491
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
can you get as experts can get

492
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
doctors to support what you're having to

493
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
say and really that's the way in which

494
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,280
these actor groups

495
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,240
go and build these campaigns

496
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,679
yes so for the activist actors really

497
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,960
um the harm that they can can reach as

498
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
we've seen

499
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
um is mainly in the physical space i

500
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,919
mean

501
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,360
this equipment is

502
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
costing these tower equipments to

503
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
hundreds of thousands to millions of

504
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
euros and pounds and dollars worth of

505
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
damage as well

506
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
as um great um

507
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
you know monetary and reputational

508
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,799
damage to the equipment manufacturers

509
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,080
as well as the telcos so if we

510
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,600
switch over then to our second group

511
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,080
um the actors targeting

512
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
telecommunication networks and

513
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
high-tech providers um they are

514
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,640
of course a much more sophisticated

515
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
group

516
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,600
going after um the

517
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,159
access to really the access to these

518
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,440
various networks and

519
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,640
technologies and when we've analyzed

520
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
uh the traditional actors in this space

521
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
we have seen a very very

522
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,280
high attention being paid for defense

523
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,240
evasion

524
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
basically um if these actors

525
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,799
are able to gather

526
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,000
access into the network by

527
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
really the traditional means of of

528
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
gathering initial access

529
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,559
either you know gathering uh harvesting

530
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,039
credentials from the internet or using

531
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,760
uh fishing spear fishing or or even

532
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,159
whaling of

533
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,720
targeted users that they have done their

534
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,240
done their due diligence and

535
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
intellecting right down to

536
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
single individuals that they want to

537
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
target once they have managed to get

538
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,559
into the network establish

539
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,960
persistence and and gather high enough

540
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,000
privileges

541
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,120
a significant amount of their effort is

542
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,400
is to avoid detection and maintain their

543
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,360
presence

544
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,400
as uh as long as they can there are no

545
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
they're usually not there to

546
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,720
to disable uh access within the network

547
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
until the point in time

548
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
that they would be given commands to

549
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
some of these groups of course uh have

550
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,039
the um have the objective to

551
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,280
maintain their presence and listening on

552
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,640
their networks so

553
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,600
lateral movements uh to the point that

554
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
they have

555
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,919
enough high privileges to be able to

556
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,559
perform

557
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,159
interceptions on the network and then

558
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,960
have collections either from local

559
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,480
systems

560
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
or set up a type of automation

561
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,480
where they would be able to reroute

562
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,559
communication let's say from certain

563
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,919
selected individuals

564
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,440
such as vips to channels that they

565
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
control and they could be able to

566
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,720
decrypt as well um and as i mentioned

567
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,919
uh of course some of the aim is to

568
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,039
deny access to the networks

569
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,880
later so these actor groups once they

570
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,120
are

571
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
in the network there is a high

572
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
possibility that

573
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,200
it's basically a ticking time bomb on

574
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,080
your network for something that could be

575
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
really really bad and

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,159
robert you've faced some of these uh

577
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,000
teams and and can tell you tell us about

578
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
your experience with them absolutely

579
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,679
these actor groups the adversary types

580
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,799
are of course

581
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
a danger and a constant threat when

582
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
working in a telco

583
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,360
and these are things you worry about um

584
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,919
another unforeseen dark thought in the

585
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:02,880
back of our heads

586
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,679
is is around um data privacy and data

587
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,000
protection especially we're going into

588
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
really great detail about how these

589
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
actors operate and try to hide

590
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,720
they do go after the sense of

591
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
information and then

592
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
often their act on objectives is to get

593
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,679
that information

594
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,000
off of the network and into their hands

595
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
for more nefarious purposes

596
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,360
working as one of those groups that

597
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,720
could potentially be targeted you have

598
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
to worry about things

599
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,480
if in europe you're worried about gdpr

600
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,880
and

601
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
the different states you're worried

602
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,960
about that type of customer data ever

603
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,760
being

604
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
compromised because honestly

605
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
your phone or most people's phone sleeps

606
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
next to them it's charging next to your

607
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,159
bed

608
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,720
it does all of your banking it's

609
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
something that has such sensitive

610
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,159
information and it all travels through

611
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:50,720
the

612
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
telecommunication networks that you

613
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
really have to be worried about that

614
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,039
and the potential impact of what happens

615
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,960
if you do suffer a data breach or you

616
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,679
are compromised

617
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
another interesting tactic or technique

618
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,720
used by these actors is also

619
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
replication of fake networks so either

620
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,760
there was i think back in 2015 there was

621
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
some stories coming out i remember one

622
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
bbc article

623
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,799
about about these actor groups using um

624
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,960
adversary groups using stingrays which

625
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
is a really high powerful

626
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
piece of technology that makes a fake

627
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,240
network

628
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
and they were pulling information and

629
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
stealing that way so as these five

630
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
g towers go up and this type of

631
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,039
technology becomes more relevant

632
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,200
these actor groups can try to spoof that

633
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
so that

634
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,799
people think they're getting some really

635
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
high-tech powerful new network in

636
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,720
reality their data is being compromised

637
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,679
because

638
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,720
they connected to an insecure network so

639
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,200
moving on to the third group we have

640
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,559
and this is the espionage actors this is

641
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,520
more of

642
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,880
the theft of top secret information

643
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,240
these companies who are producing the 5g

644
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,559
technology as well as the telcos are

645
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
working outside of just the

646
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
telecommunication space so it's not

647
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,440
just your cell phone data being

648
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
transmitted at a different frequency

649
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
where you get better

650
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
information faster there's everything

651
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,600
from health looking to

652
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,760
health care systems using to look to use

653
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,720
5g

654
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
there's the automotive industry there's

655
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
smart manufacturing there's so many

656
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,080
different possibilities trying and

657
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,720
organizations and sectors trying to rely

658
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,320
on this new technology

659
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,640
to improve it and cyber security is one

660
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,440
of them

661
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,320
that um espionage actors are coming into

662
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,679
play because they're interested in

663
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
stealing this proprietary information

664
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,720
and

665
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
they're looking to get access to things

666
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
and help build

667
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,120
usually their state ties so they're

668
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
helping their nation or their

669
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,919
patriotism to their country and that's

670
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,279
why they're going about attacking the

671
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,080
way that they do

672
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
along those lines as bens mentioned with

673
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
the last group

674
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,400
they have a lot of advanced techniques

675
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
and tactics they use

676
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,440
they really look at basically evading

677
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,400
detection

678
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,720
establishing persistence as well as

679
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,760
establishing very

680
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
complex command and control

681
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,679
infrastructure so that they can

682
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,159
get the information out and in a covert

683
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,440
manner

684
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,279
a good spy would not be one that you

685
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,679
detect so in reality they're

686
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,200
trying to get the information out in a

687
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
way where uh you're too late to the

688
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
scene to even know that something

689
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,320
happened

690
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,679
uh bence is there anything you'd like to

691
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,320
add on espionage actors

692
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,760
indeed so espionage actors uh can

693
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,960
go into an interesting mix where

694
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,919
you know you you might not just acquire

695
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,960
somebody's

696
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,600
offline and digital persona but actually

697
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,400
go after

698
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,919
the person itself so we have seen

699
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,240
um basically espionage actors

700
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,279
bribing members of either

701
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,520
the equipment manufacturers or the

702
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,880
telecommunication

703
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,360
providers themselves to provide

704
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,480
legitimate

705
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,080
credentials or to steal and in an almost

706
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,440
james bond ask manner

707
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
exfiltrates information out of the

708
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
companies either by you know taking

709
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,120
uh pictures of of sensitive

710
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,000
deployment or stealing research and

711
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
implementation data

712
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
because of the enormous potential

713
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,320
and of course financial gain that could

714
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,640
be

715
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
won in this field as discussed

716
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,480
previously

717
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,240
so how does it all tie together

718
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,440
um robert and i have tried to pull

719
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
um together um some sort of

720
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
good tips and practices in applying

721
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
these matrices

722
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
when you're working in an organization

723
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,640
and you're trying to

724
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
you know defend the organization itself

725
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,679
your

726
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,320
supply chain uh probably you're working

727
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
at an equipment manufacturer and you're

728
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:04,559
also

729
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,120
you know trying to protect your

730
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,159
customers

731
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,080
as well as protecting the end customers

732
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
which is all of us it's the first we

733
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,840
mentioned it's the phones that we use

734
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,600
constantly it's it's the same network

735
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,880
that will

736
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,760
enable e-health remote doctors as well

737
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,399
as remote manufacturing

738
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,520
smart cars and smart factories

739
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,600
so when applying these matrices we

740
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,720
really identified

741
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,240
four teams uh that could work together

742
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
in this area

743
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,559
uh the grey team uh we call them is

744
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,120
is really your your cti team your threat

745
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
intelligence provider or the team in

746
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,640
your organization

747
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,679
who would be able to clearly use this

748
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,640
information

749
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,840
and help operalize the same information

750
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,360
that you have actionable intelligence

751
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,080
coming out of these active monitoring of

752
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,559
these

753
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,279
groups and robert as you've been part of

754
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,039
this team maybe you can share some of

755
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
your

756
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,799
experiences in this absolutely um

757
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
when trying to monitor the different

758
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,799
campaigns you try to set your

759
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,159
intelligence requirements or your

760
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,159
prioritized intelligence requirements so

761
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:16,720
that

762
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,559
you really look to go after and

763
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,399
understand the type of information

764
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,120
coming out

765
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,000
so with these more advanced actors such

766
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,640
as the

767
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,240
second and third groups we mentioned the

768
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,320
high tech as well as the espionage

769
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
you want to be able to understand how

770
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,679
these groups work

771
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,320
what are some indicators of attack or

772
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,279
indicators

773
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,159
of compromise and then how do they

774
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,760
function what are the social media

775
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
campaigns they're running if you're

776
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
talking about activist groups

777
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,240
as well as trying to to wheedle it down

778
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,039
of the greater threat landscape what's

779
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,320
relevant to you

780
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,080
and then with that information you can

781
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,399
then operationalize it and hand it over

782
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,480
to your red team or blue team depending

783
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,120
on

784
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,679
your function bench and i have worked

785
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,960
projects together

786
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,399
helping to build intelligence scenarios

787
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
for red teams so that they can go out

788
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and function and and test the

789
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
capabilities that

790
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,080
actors would employ uh on our

791
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,880
organization

792
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,000
or on our clients organizations uh bence

793
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,120
would you like to add anything on the

794
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
red teams

795
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,520
um yeah so this is something that the

796
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,760
financial services sector has actually

797
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,320
been

798
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,399
um doing and and the regulators in that

799
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,039
space

800
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,440
have been recommending for for a while

801
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,200
now but

802
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,960
especially uk and and eu regulators

803
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
are now coming up with very similar

804
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,640
networks to

805
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,679
almost mandates critical infrastructure

806
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,399
providers

807
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,840
so mainly telcos uh do a sort of

808
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,679
intelligence led penetration testing

809
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,760
so that the red team would use the

810
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,679
intelligence and use the

811
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
tools tactics and procedures

812
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,000
identified by the cti team

813
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,679
to conduct a very very realistic attack

814
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,880
and this is where

815
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,320
the um dictator between the red team and

816
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,120
the blue team

817
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,679
comes into play because they're all

818
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,760
playing from the same information but

819
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
using

820
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
common methodologies such as miter the

821
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,480
blue team

822
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,399
is also able to prepare better for these

823
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,440
type of very realistic scenarios

824
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,760
realistic actors by understanding

825
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,799
basically

826
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,240
where the attack would come from and

827
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,559
and what methods would an attacker use

828
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,440
your security operation centers are able

829
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,320
to create

830
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,360
advanced use cases to enhance detections

831
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,399
your physical security uh teams will be

832
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,120
able to

833
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
protect your sites that you are seeing

834
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,799
under attack

835
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,559
and you know you can more rapidly detect

836
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,679
anomalous activities from the uh

837
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,640
more capable and credible actor groups

838
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,159
mainly in the last two groups

839
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,799
that's so correct benson and really

840
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,880
going around building these use cases

841
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,519
and

842
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
starting to think like the adversary is

843
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,960
is something that

844
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,120
a lot of blue or security operation

845
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,880
teams don't get into they

846
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
they stay in their security bubble and

847
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,399
they work with the information and logs

848
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,360
they have

849
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,159
but taking this outside approach you can

850
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,200
start to build

851
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,120
what are the methodologies what

852
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
information what gaps do i have as a

853
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,159
blue team

854
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,320
and then based on that you can detect

855
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,360
anomalous activity quick more quickly

856
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,279
the white team which is the third group

857
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,519
or fourth group here

858
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
this this is your more strategic

859
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,279
stakeholders this is your senior

860
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,159
management

861
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,679
these are the decision makers in your

862
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,000
organization uh we alluded to

863
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
in the presentation that uh sea levels

864
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,159
were very concerned about

865
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
the potential for uh attacks by activist

866
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,320
groups

867
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,000
because that has an impact on physical

868
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,559
security brand and reputation

869
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,240
using this type of information in these

870
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,159
matrices you can

871
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,159
apply a more strategic or tactical

872
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,840
approach in which you look at the threat

873
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,799
landscape

874
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,399
identify shifts as well as know when to

875
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,399
engage law enforcement you have public

876
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,720
relation plans in place

877
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,760
and you know how to handle these

878
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,799
situations much better

879
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,360
indeed and with armed with this

880
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,640
information as well

881
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,919
you know why teams are are able to

882
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,240
scan the horizon and any changes in the

883
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,519
threat landscape

884
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,279
and be able to more proactively

885
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,880
basically put resources

886
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,080
either technical resources and

887
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,240
people that you are that they already

888
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,399
have access to in the organization

889
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
but also make intelligence-led decisions

890
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,919
on future investments

891
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,200
on how to better prepare themselves

892
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,840
against

893
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,039
these type of attacks

894
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,360
