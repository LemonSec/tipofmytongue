actually i'm eddie williams from g data

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
i'm a security evangelist but let's

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,079
first of all

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,279
let's go to our first slide

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,480
so actually i'm working virgin data if

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,519
you

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,880
haven't come to g data yet i advise you

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,960
to do so because it's a

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
very interesting over there we are based

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
in germany

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
we of course we are

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,800
have security solutions for home and

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,399
businesses

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,840
and we are actually available in uh

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
worldwide um

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
these are our offices actually

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,719
it looks very old but if you're coming

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,440
inside

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,480
it's very new actually so

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,840
uh if there are any star trek fans over

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,399
here

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,719
actually you would recognize more or

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,480
less the bridge

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,438
in our entrance and this is actually our

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,400
entrance of

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
our building so you see it's actually

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,240
like the bridge

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
of star trek more or less with some

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,479
imagination

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,720
if you don't know me i'm eddie williams

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
um i'm

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
a long time i'm already a long time

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
a security expert actually working for

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,720
several

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,240
companies um actually the most important

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,759
thing i've done in my life i think

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
besides

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,479
you know it's maybe

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
my job is of course writing a couple of

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,320
books actually

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,360
i you can even

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
try to find my books online at this

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,119
moment definitely cyber danger in

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,600
english

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,880
should be available for you as well so i

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,360
hope

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
you can enjoy that and you can try to

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,520
find it on amazon or

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
somewhere else anyway that's not what we

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
are coming to do today because today we

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
are going to tell you something about

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
the spy inside all of us

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,239
and if you look to all the threats and

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,959
all the major threats we see these days

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
um it's it's quite logical we see

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,200
over at least if you count everything we

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
see more like

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
one billion kind of uh malware threats

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
outside

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
and all of them are nearly invisible

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
actually the part we are going to

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
discuss today are completely invisible

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,599
as well the ones who are not visible

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,519
are actually the ones who are visible

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,120
actually is ransomware that's a

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
completely different

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
kind of malware of course which we're

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
not going to talk about today

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
of course the real reason why

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,720
malware like these exist is of course

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
malware game money game sorry

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
that's of course the real reason now

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
let's have a look to

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
what spyware really is spyware

77
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,400
is actually malware that aims to gather

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
information about a person

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
or organization sometimes with it

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
without their knowledge

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
and send such information to another

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,599
entity

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,959
uh entity um without consumers concepts

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,159
that's the definition of spire

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
at least in wikipedia now

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,799
if you look to what we are going to

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,280
discuss today this is very very

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
uh well more or less the same

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
actually what we're going to discuss

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,840
today is stalk aware and stalker varies

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
monitoring software or spyware

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
it's actually a kind of subdivision of

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,959
spyware

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,480
that is used for stocking the term was

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
coined actually when people started to

96
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,599
widely use

97
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
commercial spyware to spy on their

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,720
spouses

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,080
or intimate partners and

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
yeah that's what we see with stalkerware

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
so let's have a look to the

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,080
stalkers cyber toolkit actually

103
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
you most of us know this i think

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,760
like a typical ip cam this is ring

105
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,959
and a lot of users are actually

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
using this a lot of people are actually

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,238
using this

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,199
i am pretty sure that in the public

109
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,000
today

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
over here some people have bought this

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
actually this device can be misused

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
by a stalker because you can put this

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
everywhere actually and you can stalk

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,560
your

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
spouse or you can start your you know

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,960
friend or whatever with it

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,840
so this is a camera but there are so

118
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
many other cameras there are so many

119
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,160
other

120
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
tools which a stalker can use

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,080
this one seems to be like a video

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,720
recorder

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
but it isn't actually it is

124
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,039
a camera another one well if you look at

125
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
this this seems to be a cable

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
now well it is a cable but it is also

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
a camera you can see the small camera

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,080
thing over here yeah so

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
this seems like a clock but it is

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
of course a clock but it's also a camera

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
and if you put this in for instance your

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
bedroom well

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
you know what can happen this

134
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
is a camera it's also a clock of course

135
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,199
but it is also a camera so we have so

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,600
many

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
devices like this well this is not a

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
camera this is actually something like

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,199
to spy

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,919
and to amplify the sounds in in from

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,160
over a long distance so you can spy on

142
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
several people but it is part of the

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
stalker's toolkit

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,680
actually well you have a lot of gps

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
trackers which are actually used for

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,320
stalking people as well

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,240
and then there is the mobile phone

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
and that's the thing we are going to

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
talk about today

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
actually we're going to talk about first

151
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,039
of all the features of stock aware

152
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,240
sometimes we call it also spouse ware

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
so first of all it's usually installed

154
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,759
on android sometimes

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
ios windows or mac os

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
it stays completely hidden completely

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,919
operating in the background and it has

158
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,440
access to nearly

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,319
everything on your device of course it's

160
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,319
monitoring these but it's also

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,360
um uploading this to the cloud in in a

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,479
lot of cases so

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,639
video voice recordings everything

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
stealing phone calls logs

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,919
and it shares sensitive information with

166
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,880
the third party

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,720
the stock normally mostly the installer

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
of the software

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
so let's have a look to the divisions

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,479
between

171
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
what is stalker where what is spyware

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
what is parental control because

173
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
if you look at it there are a lot of

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
similarities between

175
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,120
stalkerware spyware and parental control

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,039
so if you look at it you see that

177
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,440
stockwear is mainly manually installed

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
that's exactly the same

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
what parental control software is the

180
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,080
is doing so spyware itself

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
of course is a little bit different

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
because it's automatically installed via

183
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,400
exploits

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
and mail social engineering or whatever

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
anyway it's easily found on the internet

186
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
which is typically as well for stockwear

187
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
and parental control

188
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
and in stock rates also supplied as a

189
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
service

190
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
and definitely it has a very vague

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
legal status it's a little bit the

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,759
problem with stock aware actually

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,759
actually starkville is really invading

194
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,479
the privacy without users knowledge

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
and it's completely silent there's the

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
difference with parental control

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
because there are a lot of notifications

198
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
all around

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
and that's the difference however let's

200
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,879
have a look

201
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
how these similar similarities

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,319
um you know um is is this the only thing

203
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,400
which we see between parental control

204
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
spyware and startware well

205
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,039
first of all let's have a look is star

206
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,240
career

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
really so special or new

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,840
well let's go back with me to 2005.

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
so this is a recording from 2005 when

210
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,279
uh the german television came to my

211
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,479
house

212
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
to talk about well spyware

213
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,880
which was actually

214
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
stalkerware so this is me

215
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
um about well 15 years ago

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,519
so you see that at that moment even

217
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
stalker

218
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
existed and it's not away yet

219
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,240
so it's old

220
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,440
and it's still here so why is it

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,480
still popping up well i think we are

222
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,959
much more privacy aware these days and

223
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
there was also eva gilbert which have

224
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,760
talked about this subject several times

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
there was actually a very good ted talk

226
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
uh about soccer so um

227
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
these things together the privacy aware

228
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
thing is one of the stuff and also you

229
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
know there is a lot of people who are

230
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
complaining about you know the me too

231
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
generation all that stuff well that's

232
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,760
actually the reason why

233
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
stock aware is becoming now more visible

234
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
in

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
you know in the world so it's better

236
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
timing

237
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
now let's have a look to the definition

238
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
of stalker bear from a technical

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
point of view first of all we call it

240
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
apps that share sensitive user data with

241
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
the installer without explicit content

242
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
and persistent notification of the

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
affected user

244
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,480
that is tonkaware so apps that present

245
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
themselves as a spying or secret

246
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,959
surveillance solution

247
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,720
and apps that are capable of tracking

248
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
users and monitoring user behavior and

249
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,160
do not provide

250
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
explicit explicit notification to the

251
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,160
users

252
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,440
so this is what we call stock aware

253
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
now um let's have a look to the

254
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
promotion and the advertising

255
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
if you look to stock aware we see that

256
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
well

257
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
it's like commercial spyware actually

258
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,680
which is advertised via online bearers

259
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,399
and social media very aggressively you

260
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,519
can see it really

261
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,600
everywhere you really look around a

262
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
little bit

263
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
it's also advertised on social media by

264
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,720
bloggers

265
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
with millions of views actually um

266
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
and the commercial spyware developers

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,120
even use

268
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
black easy seo techniques so

269
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
stockwear on itself can easily be found

270
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,959
after a quick internet search

271
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,600
if you type it in you will find it

272
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
definitely

273
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
but if you look to how it promoted

274
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,880
itself

275
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
it's completely different maybe because

276
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
stock aware well this is how they

277
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,279
advertise sensors

278
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,279
this is one of this is an example

279
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,920
and this is advertising themselves as

280
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
something like parental control

281
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
software so it's for parents it's for

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
yourself

283
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,240
it's even for employers pay attention

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,200
employers

285
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
yes and we have seen cases actually

286
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,200
where employers

287
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
are using it as well now

288
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
this is another example this is how they

289
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
advertise themselves

290
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
you know they show the features stealth

291
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,240
mode record calls

292
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
phone internet history track facebook

293
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,279
message track

294
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,639
sms whatsapp spy

295
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,200
you know tracfone location all these

296
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
things

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
this is how they typically advertise

298
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
themselves to the public

299
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,240
it's a parental control

300
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,079
software thingy now

301
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
this is another one so the world's most

302
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
powerful monitoring software for

303
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
computers mobile phones and tablets

304
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
well if i look at this flexispy actually

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,320
flexispy was also mentioned in the

306
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
documentary about which i showed a

307
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
couple of moments ago

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,680
15 years ago and it's still over here

309
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
it's still there actually if i look at

310
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
this how do i have it

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,800
isn't it well

312
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
maybe you should think twice anyway

313
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,680
the thing is how do they make money well

314
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,720
easy

315
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
because the pricing is mostly a service

316
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
and it's 25 euros a month that's

317
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
how they make money out of it

318
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,839
so is it difficult to install stock

319
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,720
aware or

320
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
how could you get infected with

321
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,920
starcover

322
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,360
actually that's maybe the strange thing

323
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,279
it is manually installed

324
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
in let's say most of the cases now

325
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,120
you should say or you could say wow okay

326
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
then it's not that simple to install and

327
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
that's right

328
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
so if you're not that technical

329
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,959
you know good in all those technical

330
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
things to install it on yours

331
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,440
on your friend's phone or whatever

332
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,639
well so if you want an easier way to

333
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
install flexi spy in this case

334
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,440
then just purchase the installation

335
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,320
service

336
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
and they install it together with you

337
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,519
so it's quite easy think about it

338
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,639
yeah and um so

339
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
you know they give more explanations

340
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
they give more even

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,360
ios is no problem at all say they always

342
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
have a possibility to install

343
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,240
the stock aware

344
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
so what about ios well

345
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
ios of course is much more problematic

346
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
than if you install something like this

347
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,240
on android so it's a much longer process

348
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
to install

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,320
the starcraft has less features

350
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
available

351
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
and for most functions the devices needs

352
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,480
to be jailbroken or installed via an mdm

353
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
the mobile device management system

354
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
but there are always possible

355
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
possibilities

356
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
to install stock aware on

357
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
ios devices this is just an example

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
and of course when there is a new ios

359
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,320
upgrade

360
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
this page is also replaced by new

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
possibilities as well

362
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
so do we have a lot of stock aware well

363
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,480
you have a lot of names these are a

364
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,519
couple of

365
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,199
them which we tracked down this is just

366
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,480
examples actually so

367
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,760
most of them over here are android stock

368
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,800
awares over here

369
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
there are a lot yes now i always

370
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
sometimes get a question

371
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,800
is stalkerware available in official app

372
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,079
stores

373
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,240
well i can tell you that um

374
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
the

375
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
stock aware is sometimes available in

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
some cases

377
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
indeed on the app stores however it

378
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,480
disappears

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,120
mostly very quickly but we have seen

380
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,240
cases where we

381
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,759
tracked down starker bear on those

382
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
stores however in most cases it's just

383
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,680
on the web

384
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
so you can easily find it on the web and

385
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,920
then of course you always can install it

386
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,959
by different

387
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
ways so what are the most affected

388
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,480
countries

389
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,279
or users actually well if you look at

390
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,600
this

391
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,320
well there are some specific countries

392
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,959
which are

393
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
seems to be targeted much more than

394
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
other countries and actually if you look

395
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,839
to this

396
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,079
it's like germany uk from spain

397
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,759
uh yeah well you know it's it's it's

398
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,160
a very big countries of course

399
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
and of course yeah with a lot of users

400
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,759
we don't know

401
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,639
why we see these things over there but

402
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,759
we see it a lot

403
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
also the u.s is of course in that list

404
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,759
i will tell you more about that soon

405
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,399
so the real problem is of course the

406
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,199
vague

407
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,920
legal status of stark aware in the

408
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,279
countries

409
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
you could say that career in

410
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
a lot of countries is legal because they

411
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
promote themselves as something like

412
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,040
parental control software however if you

413
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,920
look if you dig

414
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
down you see that it's much more

415
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,000
than parental control

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
software however in some

417
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,520
countries it seems to be legit

418
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,559
or they are sometimes what we call just

419
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,760
on the edge

420
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,520
of what is legal and that's the problem

421
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
now what really is worrying me is this

422
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,919
and these are things we see more and

423
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,200
more these days

424
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,240
like barclays installs big brother style

425
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
spiral on employees computers

426
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
this is not a good thing this is

427
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,720
something you should

428
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
think about twice if you see this

429
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
popping up

430
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,799
i don't know if this is really legal

431
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
this is not legal in

432
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,799
in most of the countries but yes it

433
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,320
seems to be possible

434
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,440
in the us um

435
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
this is a very strange article from

436
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
cnets one in 10 americans use stock

437
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
aware

438
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,480
to track partners and access

439
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,360
come on what is happening in the states

440
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,760
this

441
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
is not going into the right direction

442
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,440
so this means that of course

443
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
stucco very interesting to to to

444
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
to create it seems but it's of course

445
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,880
not good for us

446
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
or for the people who are stuck with it

447
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,559
a stock aware app leaked phone data from

448
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,080
thousands of victims and that's the

449
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
other problem

450
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,080
it seems that one of the apps we've seen

451
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,559
these days and we've seen also in our

452
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,880
presentation seems to be leaking phone

453
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
data because you are dealing with

454
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
okay a company but does it have any

455
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
security measures in place to guard the

456
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
data

457
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,240
well obviously

458
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
not if you read this

459
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,039
a stock where developer demands

460
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,320
techcrunch to remove

461
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,640
article detailing its leaking of

462
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,840
sensitive data

463
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
now this is definitely also not going

464
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
into the right direction

465
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,679
so this is not good this means that

466
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,600
some stockholm have done that seems to

467
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,280
be wanting

468
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
that that article is not published

469
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
so well you know i actually completely

470
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
against this kind of thing though so

471
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
maybe there is some truth in it

472
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
but this is definitely not a good thing

473
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,439
to do

474
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,679
so what can we do

475
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,400
what are the technical challenges and

476
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
what can you do

477
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
so let's first of all look to the

478
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,039
what i call solutions from us

479
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,240
well stock aware is sometimes considered

480
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
legal in some countries

481
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,039
and is not identified as malware however

482
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,360
when many security products detect it

483
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,679
and alert users about it

484
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,799
um so it is maybe changing

485
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,480
and also what we see is that mostly

486
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
that's one of the problems we have of

487
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
course at this moment we cannot

488
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,760
just only detect these kind of things

489
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,919
so what we do is that we mostly detected

490
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,679
it as a potentially

491
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,799
unwanted application so sometimes you

492
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,320
need to switch this future

493
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,039
on in your product to be able to detect

494
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,919
it

495
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,120
so it's a special category

496
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,720
so this is one problem we are dealing

497
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,200
with

498
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
in our products because of the legality

499
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,199
or the vague legal status

500
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,240
then secondly the security industry

501
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
problem the technical challenges itself

502
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
first of all if you

503
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,840
have something on your phone with this

504
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
well the security apps themselves can't

505
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,320
remove a privileged

506
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,840
app and most stock aware are privileged

507
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,159
apps an app with device administrator

508
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
rights can prevent its removal

509
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
an app can interact with the security

510
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,960
app user interface via accessibility

511
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
services so

512
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,039
you know it's like a game you know we

513
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,440
can't

514
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,720
do too much about it so what you need to

515
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,159
do is you need to call

516
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,799
actually your security provider at that

517
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,760
moment

518
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,919
now the classic danger the more security

519
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
apps detect stock where apps

520
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,200
the more difficult to detect they will

521
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
become

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,559
that's the other problem so what should

523
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,879
we do

524
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,960
it's not an easy answer i think

525
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,320
what can you do well first of all

526
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,679
protect the access to your device

527
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,520
meaning that you use uh you know

528
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,720
your fingerprint your face recognition

529
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,600
or already passwords of course if you

530
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,520
have a password or fingerprint don't

531
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,000
share those parts with fingerprints with

532
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,360
others even with your spouse even with

533
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,280
your best friend or whatever

534
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,520
because that's sometimes the problem

535
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,039
yeah because

536
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,280
they are installing the stockwear on

537
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,918
your system

538
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
install a security app at least if you

539
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,760
have a security app in place

540
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
you can detect that there is something

541
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
on the device itself

542
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,080
to get rid of it that's another thing if

543
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
suspicion

544
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
call your security vendor they are going

545
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
to help you

546
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
now if you still have a lot of other

547
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,720
questions what you always

548
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,400
can do get in touch with the stop stop

549
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,280
aware

550
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
organization and

551
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,080
this is interesting because you know

552
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,760
there is an organization i will show

553
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,080
that

554
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,200
to you within the next slides

555
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
another thing if you are well

556
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,120
if suspicion reach out to the police

557
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,200
because this is something for the police

558
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,760
to handle now stopstarkaware.org

559
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
is indeed an interesting coalition

560
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
against starkville

561
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,120
there are a lot of firms a lot of

562
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
security firms

563
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,240
and other groups which are

564
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
against this kind of software

565
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
these are just a couple of the founders

566
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,520
