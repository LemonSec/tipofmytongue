00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,439
hello everyone thanks for tuning in

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,600
my name is ignat and today we're going

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,640
to talk about

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
passwords and copy paste first a little

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,519
bit about myself

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
i work at cloudflare i do mostly

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,200
performance and security

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,440
i'm also passionate about crypto and

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
enjoy a low level program

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,960
okay let's talk about passwords first

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
passwords actually have

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,480
a very long history first passwords were

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
known to be used by old

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,320
ancient roman empire in their

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,360
military operations and

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
passwords are still being widely used

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,200
and it's

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
the most common widely used pillar or

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,320
authentication

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
and that's why passwords are still being

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,440
a valuable target for an attacker

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
so let's check out the most common

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,559
password attacks

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
the most simple and obvious one is a

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,000
brute force attack

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
where the attacker just tries every

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
possible combination

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,760
of a password until they succeed the

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,438
second

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,880
popular attack are dictionary attack

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
which is basically not what you see on

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
this slide

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
it's when the attacker compiles a list

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
of the most commonly used words as

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,320
passwords

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
create some automation and also tries

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,159
all of them

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
into a specific application or service

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,320
until they succeed

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
and finally we have services account or

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,079
hijacks or leaks and these can be

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,200
further broken down into the client side

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,520
where we have phishing emails fake pages

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,360
or social engineering

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
or server side where we can have

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
database links called vulnerabilities

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,479
and social

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,439
engineering as well

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
and to contract all these modern

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
passwords attack today modern

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
secure passwords should be long random

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,200
like

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
hard to guess and also most importantly

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,280
never

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,880
used for an website in practice though

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,280
what

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
it means that long means they're hard to

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,399
remember

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
random like they're mean it's hard to

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,840
remember hard to guess

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
means hard to remember and never use

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
where and websites mean

63
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,480
end times hearts to remember and the

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
more

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
the more the like sophisticated attacks

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
on passwords

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
are being developed the more complex our

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
modern passwords are becoming

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
luckily we have a solution to that it's

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
called a password manager

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
where to cope with this ever-growing

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
complexity of our modern passwords

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
so with the password manager you don't

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
have to remember each of your passwords

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,400
you

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
you take all your passwords and remember

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
they are unique for all

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
each service you're using then you take

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,680
a database

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
you store all your passwords in a

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
database then you basically come up with

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,560
a real

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
one really secure master password

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
converted to cryptographic key and

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
encrypted database

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
so with password managers you don't have

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
to remember many passwords you

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
have to remember only one secure

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
passwords and your other service

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
passwords can be as complex as required

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
because computers are better at

92
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,840
remembering complex things than

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
humans and your passwords also are

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,120
totally

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,599
random looking like and they can be

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
unique per service

97
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
and also it's very simple and easy to

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
use

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,879
that's it happy end and see you next

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,480
year

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,319
well not so fast right uh

102
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,560
only we we just password managers helped

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,879
us

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,519
to solve the ever growing complexity of

105
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
more insecure passwords but now we

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
started seeing instances

107
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,480
where uh some web service

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
developers starting to block copy paste

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
basically the basic assumptions around

110
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
the password manager that you can like

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,640
copy paste your complex password from

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
the password manager into

113
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
the some service uh password input field

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,280
but many

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
developers started blocking that and

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,200
back in the day

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,159
uh famous security researcher troy hunt

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
made like a so-called investigation why

119
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
what

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
service owners do that and most common

121
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,759
reasons he got was

122
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,478
the first one is that some developers

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,759
have

124
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,320
concerns about clipboard security so

125
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,800
they think malware may

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
intercept the password from the

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
clipboard but

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
for some reason they don't think about

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,199
that the same malware can probably

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
intercept keystrokes as well

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,919
some say they protect themselves from

132
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
password brute force

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
somehow they imagine that attackers just

134
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
manually type in

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,000
and first password by hand in front of

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
the computer

137
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,360
was probably not a really valid argument

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
some reference some compliance

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
requirements but when you ask them which

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,080
ones

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
no one really points out which ones

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
and like more obscure answers is because

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
it's our procedure because

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
this is how it works

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
luckily there is some rebel movement

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
around

147
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,520
to counteracting these services and

148
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
allow us to

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
paste our secure passwords from a

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,080
password manager and there are some

151
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,160
things you can do to

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,960
work with these services so the first

153
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,440
thing

154
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,520
you can probably do is if you're using

155
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
firefox you can set this config

156
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
option to false which will disable

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
javascript on copy and cut and paste

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
events

159
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
and so the web application will not

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
receive those events and those events

161
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,360
are usually used to implement all the

162
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
copy paste blocking techniques and

163
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
javascripts

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,960
and it's has no extra dependencies it's

165
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
easy

166
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,639
and but it's not very reliable because

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
there are some other events developer

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
can utilize to detect copy-pasting

169
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,600
activity

170
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,680
and it's not portable it's for firefox

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
only and

172
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,160
also it can break other functionality

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,680
so modern javascript reactive javascript

174
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
applications extensively use these

175
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,319
events for

176
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,600
other usability and functionality and

177
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
by disabling these events you can

178
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,440
completely break the web application

179
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,759
so this approach is not very great so

180
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
it's basically like cracking and not

181
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,039
with a sledgehammer

182
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,680
the second popular approach we can take

183
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,080
is

184
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
we can use some kind of specialized

185
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360
browser extension

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
to unblock copy paste and these comments

187
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
usually come in two flav two flavors

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,720
the first flavor is they just inject

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
more javascript into your document

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
object model which tries to contract the

191
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,840
paste block in javascript

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
these are most likely third-party

193
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,000
extensions and they

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,319
actually like unblock copy based

195
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
functionality in the web application

196
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,479
the other kind is they just manipulate

197
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
your docudocument object model directly

198
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
as you browse

199
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
the web and they uh prefilled passwords

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,639
for you

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,800
these come from the password manager

202
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
vendors themselves because they actually

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
need access

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,520
to to your passwords to to do that

205
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,479
uh yeah the pros for this approach is

206
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
it's easy

207
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,800
it's easy to install usually these

208
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
extensions are available in your browser

209
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,000
web store

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
and they usually require zero

211
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
configuration

212
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
the downsides are they're not very

213
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,840
reliable though they may not capture

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
all blocking techniques and again

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
they're not pro

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
portable uh usually these extensions are

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
available for firefox and chrome and not

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,880
for

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,919
more rarely used browsers

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,960
and again because these extensions mess

221
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
with your document object module with

222
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,879
your browsing data they can break other

223
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,440
functionality

224
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,919
the another downside for me for this

225
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,879
approach is

226
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
this basically when you install any of

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
these extensions you will get a similar

228
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,000
warning

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
saying that hey the browser extension

230
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,639
you're about to install

231
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,879
can read and change all the all your

232
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
data on the websites you use it so it

233
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,919
can manipulate all your browsing data

234
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,240
and basically it has to do that because

235
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
this is by design to unblock paste

236
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,919
the these extensions need to manipulate

237
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
your browsing data

238
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,639
but also think about the these

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
extensions around

240
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
running within the browser themselves as

241
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,240
well and they have full network access

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
so let's recap you're installing a third

243
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,360
party code

244
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,279
which can manipulate all your browsing

245
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,959
data and has full network access

246
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
what could possibly go wrong here right

247
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
and even though like most

248
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
of these extensions are not malicious uh

249
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
the developers of these extensions are

250
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
not malicious these extensions are

251
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,839
more likely to be hijacked by attackers

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,040
and then

253
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
like like achieving some kind of code

254
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
execution and then the attackers might

255
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,279
be able to see and manipulate all your

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,399
browsing data

257
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,600
which is not great

258
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
so yeah i was trying to solve this

259
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,360
problem and i was thinking like can

260
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,320
an operating system instead helped me to

261
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,880
unblock

262
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,600
the copy based functionality in such web

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
application

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,880
and there is hope and i came up with an

265
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,399
approach which i'm going to present now

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,800
so but before that let's like from a

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,959
like 1000 ppu

268
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
review how these space blocking

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,959
techniques work so you have like a

270
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,200
javascript enabled web application you

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
have some users

272
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
these users might try to paste the

273
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
password from a password manager or type

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
it in

275
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
so what this web application does it

276
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,519
usually implements some kind of

277
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
filter which tries to detect the paste

278
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,040
activity

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
and block it and just allow the typing

280
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
activity from the user

281
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,200
and the all these browser extensions

282
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
what they it's on blog page they what

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
they try to do is they try to find that

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,959
filter in the web application and

285
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,959
disable

286
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,440
and with operating system approach we

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,120
take a slightly different

288
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
uh strategy so instead of

289
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
trying to make the filter and instead of

290
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
pasting the password directly into the

291
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,600
web application

292
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
we paste our password into the operating

293
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,120
system

294
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
or some process in the operating system

295
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
and what that process will do

296
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,519
they will convert our page to typing

297
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,120
activity and type this

298
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,399
password for us so we will not try to

299
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
subvert the web application

300
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
space blocking filter but we will

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
instead just provide

302
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,640
the password in the way it expects if by

303
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
typing

304
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,519
the only difference is that the typing

305
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
will not be done by a real person

306
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,120
it will be done by your operating system

307
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
so i wrote a simple tool introducing a

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
pass kb

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,279
so again we have the web application we

310
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,480
have the users

311
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
we have this simple command line tool

312
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
where

313
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
you can paste the password from the

314
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
password manager there

315
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,519
and this tool on linux will use a

316
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,959
special w input

317
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,760
device and on windows it will use the

318
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,640
send input

319
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
function which will convert your

320
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
password to typing

321
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
and provided to the web application

322
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
let's see a short demo how it works

323
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
okay so i have three fields i have a

324
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:38,560
like

325
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
very poor password manager with a simple

326
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
document

327
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
so the green field allows you to copy

328
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,079
paste and

329
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
the red fields do not allow you to copy

330
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,440
paste and they use

331
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
two different techniques to block you so

332
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,480
let's try

333
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
the we see we can paste the password in

334
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
the green field but we cannot place the

335
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,959
password in the red field

336
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,600
so let's try to use my tool you open a

337
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,680
terminal

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
you launch the pascab tool and then you

339
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
paste your password there

340
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,279
and then you have five seconds to

341
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,920
transfer the cursor back into the block

342
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
paste block field and the operating

343
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,079
system types it in

344
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
let's try different face blocking

345
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,320
techniques technique again

346
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,600
let's launch our tool paste the password

347
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
return the cursor back and the operating

348
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,639
system

349
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,839
types it in

350
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
okay

351
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,000
yep so as you saw

352
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
the advantages of this approach is cross

353
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,079
platform it's fully browser independent

354
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
it works in any browser and beyond so

355
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
the operating system doesn't care where

356
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,959
to type

357
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
the password as long as the course are

358
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,240
in the right place

359
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
it has no access to your browsing data

360
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
because it's a separate

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
separate process it doesn't run inside

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
the browser

363
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,760
it has no network access you can because

364
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
it's a separate process you can

365
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,320
further constrain it sandbox it jail it

366
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,880
and

367
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
allow it only to generate typing

368
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,319
activity whatsoever

369
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,240
it has it follows the unix do one thing

370
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,360
philosophy so this tool only like

371
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
types the passwords and it's simple and

372
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,959
reliable

373
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
there are no settings to manage there is

374
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
no state there is no heuristics

375
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
and there is no regex to configure and

376
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,199
most importantly

377
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,639
the advantage of this tool now it cannot

378
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
be detected and blocked by

379
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,480
these websites because from the web

380
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
applications point of view

381
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
it sees a typing activity and it

382
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
technically cannot tell the difference

383
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
if the typing is done by a human or

384
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
by the i the application so there is no

385
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,839
way

386
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,800
a web application developer can now copy

387
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,760
paste

388
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,959
on their input forms

389
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,279
there are some downside of course it's

390
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,079
this tool

391
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,120
still doesn't work for mac os health

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
wanted

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,480
this tool doesn't work on mobile devices

394
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,880
uh

395
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
mobile devices are a bit different and i

396
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
think both android and ios have

397
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,079
now have already much better workflow to

398
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,079
pasting passwords

399
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,279
into these input fields so

400
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,920
probably even not needed there and as

401
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,560
you saw

402
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
from the demo the big downside is the

403
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,079
usability

404
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,920
you basically need to run a terminal

405
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
session alongside your browsing session

406
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,360
uh you need to some you need to do some

407
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,279
additional setup and configuring on

408
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,399
linux to

409
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,720
uh fix the permission of the special w

410
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
input device

411
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
and most most obvious that you basically

412
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
need to quickly switch windows to paste

413
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,519
the password so you need to paste the

414
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
password into the command line

415
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,519
uh application then switch the window

416
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
into the browser put the cursor

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,880
and like wait till the passwords

418
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
will be typed in

419
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,560
but other than that i think it's a great

420
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,199
start

421
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,720
to start using a password managers

422
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
with a website to safely start using a

423
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
password manager with websites who block

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
copy paste functionality

425
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
so what can you do if you are an

426
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
internet user and you still are not

427
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
using a password manager

428
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,519
definitely consider start using one

429
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,360
already

430
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
if you're a web developer and you're

431
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,519
developing a web service please please

432
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,199
please please please please

433
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,920
don't block copy paste because it

434
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,240
actually makes your users less secure

435
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
and not more secure because they can't

436
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,959
use the password manager

437
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,959
well please use my tool provide feedback

438
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,160
if you have the ability please help me

439
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,360
make

440
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,639
this tool help me to make this tool work

441
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,240
on my course

442
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
and finally spread the word with

443
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,839
this operating system level approach the

444
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,720
paste blocking javascript is meaningless

445
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,399
now because there is no way

446
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,160
you can block copy paste and detect

447
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,360
the typing from the store so just don't

448
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
do it anymore

449
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,079
we will not protect you will not make

450
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,199
your users more secure and this approach

451
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,720
can always be bypassed and

452
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
it's just like waste of time and

453
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,519
frustration

454
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,639
finally here are some links so the first

455
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,320
link is the link to the

456
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
troy's hand blog post i mentioned which

457
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
describes in more detail

458
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
about the research about the copy paste

459
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
blocking techniques on different

460
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,120
websites

461
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,160
the second link is useful in order for

462
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,959
us

463
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,039
to verify that we're not imagining

464
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,160
things these

465
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,119
are official recommendations from uk

466
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
government

467
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
to service uh operators not to block

468
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
copy based on password input fields so

469
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
even the government's advise you to do

470
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
that the third link

471
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
is the link to the web page with

472
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
which illustrates some javascript page

473
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,119
blocking techniques

474
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,919
i used in my demo and the final link is

475
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,240
the source code of my

476
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,840
kb tool on github please review the code

477
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
and make a pull request comment and

478
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,799
provide feedback

479
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,840
and finally i wanted to say that if

480
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
you're a web developer and still

481
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
blocking copy paste

482
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
we will find you and please please

483
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,400
please please please

484
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,760
don't do that anymore

485
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,760
that's it basically what i wanted to say

486
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,799
for now i'm now happy to take any

487
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,440
questions you might have

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,080
have a nice day thank you
