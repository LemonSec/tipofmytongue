00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400
hello everyone

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,200
my name is scott acai i help tech

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
companies close a soft skills gap

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,679
so they can maximize performance and

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,440
retention

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,320
i'm a keynote speaker and recently did a

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
tedx talk in hawaii entitled

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
saving soft skills from extinction

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,560
today i'll be talking about how soft

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
skills get hard results

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
but let me start with some context

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
in the it industry you were probably

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,640
hired

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
for a technical role based on your hard

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,719
skills

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
if you achieve well you get promoted

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,559
promoted to a middle management position

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,760
where now

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
your job is to manage the people that

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
you were peers with

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,879
it's a completely different skill set

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,199
and what worked for you before

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,078
won't work for you now let me explain

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
i'd like you to think back to your

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
favorite manager

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
and think of it in terms of this quote

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,119
people don't leave companies

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,600
they leave managers did you know that

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,159
micromanagers

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,360
cost companies more money in retention

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
and performance than any other factor

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
and you know why because most of the

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
time they lack soft skills

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
so go back to thinking about your

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
favorite manager

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,439
i bet if you thought about it things

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,479
that will come to your mind

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,119
are he or she listened to me

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,600
they appreciated me i felt valued

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,040
see these things are all soft skills

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
things that we don't always learn in a

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
classroom we definitely don't learn on

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,520
our

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,799
new orientation but these are things

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,079
that we learn over time

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880
through practice

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
so today we're going to focus on

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,239
improving your soft skills

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,239
and the three areas i'm going to hone in

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,040
on are communication

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,720
leadership and emotional intelligence

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,319
so let's begin with communication

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,599
communication how do you define it

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
the definition of communication is

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
simply exchanging information

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
the how matters more than the what

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
it's the reason why text messages

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,238
get misinterpreted

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760
it's because we put our own world view

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
and our own interpretation

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
on things that we can't visually see

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,720
but what we really need to do is we need

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,640
to learn how to actively listen to

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,200
understand

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,319
so right now in this pandemic

66
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
we're limited and really don't have too

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
much face time with people in person

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
so we settle for video calls

69
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
phone calls text messaging emails

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
the problem is is that as you go down to

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
something like an email or a text

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,519
message

73
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
we lose a lot of non-verbal

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
communication

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,840
you don't hear tone you don't see body

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,640
language

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,519
and it's really difficult to understand

78
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,959
how someone's saying something

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
and the question when it comes to active

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
listening is

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,159
are you listening to respond or problem

82
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
solve

83
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,480
because if you're not you're going to

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
miscommunicate

85
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
for example being in a relationship

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
with my wife a lot of times when she

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
wants to vent

88
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,959
she doesn't really want me to solve her

89
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,560
problem

90
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
she just wants me to listen and if i try

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,439
to solve her problem

92
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,840
she may actually feel like i'm not

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,519
listening

94
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,639
unfortunately i learned the hard way but

95
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,680
what i'm trying to get across

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
is that actively listening is really

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
listening to be curious

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,440
listening to try to understand not with

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
an agenda

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
not trying to fix a problem but actually

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,680
just

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
listening and trying to clarify what it

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
is that the person is trying to say

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,000
think about it in a work setting

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,720
when you think about your manager does

106
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,440
he or she

107
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,680
listen to what you're really saying

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
now eventually of course you want them

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
to give you the resource that's going to

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
help you do your job better

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,320
but in that moment what you really want

112
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
is someone just to listen to you

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
and a lot of times we don't think of

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
listening as part of communication

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,800
because we think it's all about talking

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
but some of the best communicators have

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,039
an ability

118
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,919
to be great listeners and that's

119
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,840
something that we all need to strive to

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,960
do

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
because we're in the situation that we

122
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,919
are right now as much as you can i would

123
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
highly recommend that you

124
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,199
set up video calls versus phone calls or

125
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
emails

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
and eventually when things turn around

127
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
and we're able to meet in person or

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
people feel comfortable meeting in

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
person

130
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
then i would definitely put that on the

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
top of the list

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
and the reason why is once again is that

133
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,080
you lose so

134
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,320
much when you don't have that in-person

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
communication

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
there's a lot that goes on with

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
communication that we see

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
and when we don't see those things it's

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
difficult to pick up

140
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
and really understand what the person's

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
trying to say

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
i think what's tough is communication

143
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
really is a two-way street

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
and if you really try to clarify what

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
someone's trying to say

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
that is truly what active listening is

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
honestly

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
the advice piece is actually optional

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
like i said before a lot of times people

150
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,319
don't want the advice

151
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,520
because ultimately if they're going to

152
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,318
stick with something

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
they want the information to make their

154
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,520
own decision

155
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,960
that makes their inf that makes their

156
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
decision a lot more independent

157
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,080
let's take a peek into a conversation

158
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
where active listening is actually

159
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,440
happening

160
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
so if you're having a conversation with

161
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
your boss and you're complaining

162
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,199
about one of your co-workers to them

163
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
the last thing you want them to do is to

164
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,599
take the other person's side

165
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,039
right now i'm not saying that your boss

166
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
should always agree with you

167
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
but what i am saying from the person

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
who's doing the communication

169
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,680
or the talking is that what you're

170
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,599
really looking for

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
is you're looking for your boss or

172
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,120
manager to hear you

173
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,560
out you really just want to vent at that

174
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,919
time you want to feel safe you want to

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
feel that that person

176
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,960
you can trust that person

177
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
and a lot of times what happens is that

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,039
a boss or manager

179
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
feels like they need to solve your

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
problem

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
and quite frankly even if they did is

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,680
that going to be the best solution for

183
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
you

184
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,240
no it's not

185
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,440
because they don't have the issue with

186
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
the co-worker

187
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,720
you do so the more they can help you

188
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
and resource you with the tools to be

189
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,560
able to solve your own problems

190
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,840
that actually empowers you

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
and by that are they really telling you

192
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
what to do

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
probably not they're probably just

194
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
asking the right questions

195
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,479
to unlock the answers

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
so your goal in terms of communication

197
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759
and being a great listener is to listen

198
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,120
for clarity

199
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,000
so when someone says something to you

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
before you respond

201
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
just clarify back to them what they said

202
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
and when you ask them for clarification

203
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
and they say yes that's exactly what i

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
was trying to say

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,880
from that point you've already made

206
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
progress

207
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
but a lot of times we just rush through

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,399
it

209
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
and we're so concerned about rushing

210
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
through the conversation or just solving

211
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
the problem

212
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,399
and that may be a band-aid that may get

213
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
the short-term

214
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
solution but in the long term

215
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
it doesn't do anything

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,320
so your goal as a communicator is to

217
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
help other people solve their

218
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
own challenges and problems

219
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
because ultimately that promotes

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
independence

221
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
and ownership on their part

222
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
let's move on to leadership

223
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
what's your definition of leadership

224
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
leadership is getting things done

225
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
through people

226
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,560
now that may sound a little harsh

227
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,080
even impersonal to a certain degree

228
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
but leadership has a relationship

229
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
component

230
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,560
and it has a task component okay

231
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
so think of a boat that's flowing down

232
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,320
a still lake or pond

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,959
and think about the wake that it leaves

234
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
it leaves in two directions

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
think of one side as a relationship you

236
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
have with people

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
as a leader and think of the other side

238
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,959
as the tasks that need to get done

239
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,200
under that person's leadership

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
leadership is being able to balance both

241
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
and quite frankly a lot of times it's a

242
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,040
lot less technical

243
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,839
than we may think so to go back to that

244
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,079
example

245
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,920
of when you got hired and now it's time

246
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
for promotion to middle management

247
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,040
you literally have to learn a new skill

248
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
you know why because you're in a new

249
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
role

250
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
so whatever skills helped you

251
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
get promoted to this position aren't

252
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
necessarily going to serve you as well

253
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
in your new role because now your job

254
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,399
isn't to be the best widget maker your

255
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,440
job is to

256
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
bring the best out of the widget makers

257
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,079
that are under your leadership

258
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,480
and that's a completely different

259
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
mindset shift

260
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,959
as a personal example years back

261
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,800
i worked at a test prep company an

262
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
online test prep company

263
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,959
and my role there was as a faculty

264
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,399
manager

265
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,040
i had about 30 tutors who were under my

266
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,440
leadership

267
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
and because it was a remote company

268
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
my first challenge was to understand how

269
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
to build

270
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,399
my relationship with them

271
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,079
so when i first met with each of them

272
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,360
virtually for 30 minutes per week i

273
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,040
wanted to build a profile

274
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,680
i wanted to ask them a lot of questions

275
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,440
i wanted to ask them questions about

276
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,839
themselves i wanted to know them as

277
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
people

278
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,639
and i think all good leaders

279
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
understand that each person is different

280
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,200
their motivations

281
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,839
their triggers their personality

282
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
and when you think back to your favorite

283
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,160
leader they probably treated you

284
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,600
as an individual not as a corporate

285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,480
person

286
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
not as a collective team

287
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,040
now i'm not saying that you always have

288
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,839
the luxury of that time

289
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,639
but what i am saying is that if you

290
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
really want to build that relationship

291
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
you really want to build that trust and

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
empathy you will make the time

293
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
as a leader because ultimately that's

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
what's going to help you

295
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
so going back to my example of building

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
a profile

297
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
of all the questions that i asked and i

298
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
asked plenty of them

299
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
the question that i found was the most

300
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,399
disarming

301
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,000
was how can i support you

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
i remember some of the looks on the

303
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,040
faces of

304
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,639
the people across the video screen to

305
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,040
this day

306
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
i think some of them were perplexed

307
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
i think some of them were caught off

308
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
guard

309
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,839
i think some of them weren't sure how to

310
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,720
answer that question

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,800
but the reason why i asked that question

312
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,519
is because i wanted to know how to deal

313
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,120
with that person

314
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
when things got stressful because they

315
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
were going to get stressful

316
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
and so my focus was more so

317
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,800
on the person over the task

318
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,000
because how you say something really

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,399
matters

320
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
i'm not saying that what you say doesn't

321
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
matter i'm just saying how you say it

322
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
really matters so when i was able to get

323
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
that answer from them

324
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
and understand okay when things get

325
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,279
stressful

326
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,519
do you want me to try to help you

327
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,639
problem solve

328
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,760
do you want me to give you space or

329
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
would you rather me

330
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
back off and check in a couple days

331
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,160
later

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,199
the answer to that question was so

333
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,399
helpful

334
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,680
because in the midst of tension i knew

335
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
exactly how to respond

336
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
and i think what we'll find

337
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
is that true leadership is serving

338
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
it's not from a position of power it's

339
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,040
not from a place where you're telling

340
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
someone what to do

341
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
i think great leaders actually feel like

342
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,839
the people that they serve

343
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,160
are more valuable than they are because

344
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
without them

345
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
they wouldn't be leaders in the first

346
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
place

347
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
leadership is a lot about showing versus

348
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
telling

349
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,480
i want to see my leader act out the core

350
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,199
values

351
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,880
act out the mission and vision of the

352
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
company i don't want to hear them spout

353
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
stuff off

354
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
and then be hypocrites and do the

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
opposite thing

356
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,639
that's called a politician

357
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,440
leaders value character over competence

358
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
think about it you may get hired

359
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,720
for things that are your resume mostly

360
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,480
hard skills but you get remembered

361
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
and or you get fired

362
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,560
for soft skills

363
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
that's sort of a sombring look at it but

364
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
that's the reality

365
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,440
leaders really try to get to know a

366
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,160
person

367
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,399
when you hear a testimony of a leader

368
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,880
who had an impact on you

369
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,920
it's always a personal story it usually

370
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,120
has

371
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
little to do with a title or position

372
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,240
but a lot to do with how that person

373
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,199
makes them feel

374
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,279
and influencing and impacting someone

375
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
based on how you treat them

376
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,519
is definitely a soft skill

377
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,240
in fact i don't want you to think that

378
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
leadership

379
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
is nothing but good stuff because it's

380
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,720
not quite frankly

381
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,199
if you knew the responsibility that

382
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,720
leader took on you probably wouldn't

383
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
want to do it

384
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,680
you know leaders who are really in it

385
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,079
for the right reasons

386
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,120
when they achieve victory they're going

387
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,000
to actually

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
pass the praise around to the team and

389
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,079
not take much of it

390
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
but the big thing is when things go

391
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
wrong even if they didn't do it

392
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
directly they're gonna take the blame

393
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
they're gonna take the hit for their

394
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
team

395
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
and for that reason alone a lot of

396
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,720
people don't want to be in leadership

397
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
so what i am telling you is that

398
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
leadership is a honor

399
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,639
but it's also a responsibility

400
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,199
in fact going back to the idea of

401
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,640
it not being positive but sometimes

402
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,240
being tough or negative think about the

403
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,039
idea of

404
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,799
having tough conversations

405
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
we all have to have those things and as

406
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,919
leaders i don't think anyone really

407
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,799
looks forward to them

408
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,080
but what i what i will go back to

409
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,840
is if you have built a relationship with

410
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,080
trust

411
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,919
great listening empathizing

412
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,880
then you've earned the right and let me

413
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
emphasize you've

414
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,480
earned the right to have those tough

415
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
conversations

416
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,290
those tough conversations that would go

417
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,640
[Music]

418
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
possibly far south

419
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,400
end up turning out pretty well because

420
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
you know why because the person even

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,880
though

422
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
the feedback or criticism may be harsh

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
they know it's coming from a good place

424
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,919
because they trust you

425
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,120
and they believe that what you're

426
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
telling them is only to make them better

427
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
that it's not personal that they're

428
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,480
trying to be

429
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
as objective as possible but they also

430
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
have a job to do

431
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,440
and you have to understand that

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
but what if they didn't have that

433
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
relationship with you

434
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,200
it's easy to take it personal

435
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
right if you consider your manager a

436
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,880
micromanager

437
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
really what you're saying is that you

438
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
don't trust them

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
and maybe it's because they don't trust

440
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
you

441
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,919
and the question would be how do you

442
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,600
earn that trust

443
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
and i think it's a mixture of all the

444
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,480
things that i mentioned already

445
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
so your goal as a leader

446
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,160
is to build trust and how do you do that

447
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
you do that through building a strong

448
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,520
relationship with them

449
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
it takes time

450
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,919
but from experience it's definitely

451
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,280
worth it

452
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,200
it's worth the investment

453
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
let's move on to the third point

454
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
emotional intelligence so emotional

455
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
intelligence is always

456
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,240
also known as eq and the question is

457
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,440
what is eq

458
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,799
well eq is the ability

459
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,360
to manage your emotions with others

460
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,000
that means that you literally sometimes

461
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
have to play

462
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,320
a third person to yourself before you

463
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,520
react emotionally

464
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
that's having extreme self-awareness

465
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,799
that's having extreme

466
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,039
self-regulation and it's also

467
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,480
sometimes slowing things down when

468
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
things are going really fast

469
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,919
it's really more of a choice and an

470
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,840
effort

471
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,679
than it is a skill

472
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,520
in a way listen to the stat

473
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,240
i think this is uh very powerful

474
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
daniel goldman he wrote the book

475
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
emotional intelligence at work he states

476
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
that

477
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,480
90 of what moves a person up at the

478
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,400
success ladder

479
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,840
is emotional intelligence

480
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
and people who are top achievers

481
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,520
in their role have two times as much of

482
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,240
it

483
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,200
as someone who is average while people

484
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
in senior roles

485
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,280
have four times as much of it so

486
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
emotional intelligence

487
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,640
is literally what's going to make or

488
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,039
break you

489
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,880
i believe that every great leader

490
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,840
regardless of the industry

491
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,760
is self-aware now

492
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
self-awareness can mean different things

493
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
to different people

494
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,679
but what it comes down to is how well do

495
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
you know your strengths

496
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,039
and how well do you know your weaknesses

497
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,360
you can't help other people if you can't

498
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
help yourself first

499
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,640
think about this what are you saying to

500
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,200
yourself

501
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
on a consistent basis what is the

502
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,440
self-talk

503
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
that's going on in your head

504
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,200
how aware of it are you

505
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,360
sometimes what we say to ourselves

506
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,199
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy

507
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,880
let me give you an example

508
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,480
for myself up until about five or six

509
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
years ago

510
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,000
i used to shy away from speaking

511
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,919
opportunities

512
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,960
granted i've had leadership roles

513
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,799
for a good part of my life and

514
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
i would do speaking opportunities but i

515
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,880
would do them really reluctantly

516
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
the problem is is that my mentality was

517
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
off

518
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
i was always telling myself speaking is

519
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,760
just not my thing but for some reason

520
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,960
the light bulb went off about five years

521
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,039
ago

522
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,559
i realized because i was telling myself

523
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,159
that i'm not a good speaker i performed

524
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,520
like a not very good speaker and so in

525
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
order for me to change that i had to

526
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,039
change my mindset

527
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
and i started saying to myself i want to

528
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
be a great speaker

529
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
now just saying it is not going to

530
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,080
change it

531
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,480
but that's really where it starts

532
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,919
because after that

533
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,559
i started to watch more tape on people i

534
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,000
watched ted talks

535
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,320
i used to look at stand-up comedians i

536
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,120
would pick up

537
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,840
things from speakers that i really

538
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,000
respected but really what got me better

539
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
is just getting out there and doing it

540
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,600
so i started volunteering

541
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,480
to speak and at first i definitely did

542
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,799
not get the results i wanted

543
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,080
and as i started to gain more and more

544
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,640
confidence i realized the next step

545
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
was to speak at larger gatherings

546
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
and also to record myself and watch the

547
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
video

548
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,520
and as humiliating as it was for me to

549
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,720
sit there and watch myself

550
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,640
there's nothing that beats visual

551
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,120
feedback

552
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
and eventually a year ago that's when i

553
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
challenged myself to do a ted talk

554
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,159
because it was a little bit more than i

555
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,080
was comfortable with

556
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,520
but that's what i felt like i needed to

557
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,240
do to get over that hump

558
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,159
and when people ask me why did you do a

559
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
ted talk

560
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,880
well one of the big reasons why i did it

561
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,320
was to prove it to myself now have

562
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,799
opportunities come because of it sure

563
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,720
they have

564
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,240
but really the goal of achieving it was

565
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,679
more for me than it wasn't for anyone

566
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
else

567
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,760
so what i want to do is walk you through

568
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
an activity

569
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,480
of self-talk because that really is

570
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,039
where emotional intelligence lies first

571
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,000
it starts with you

572
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
right and then it goes out to other

573
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,240
people so i'll use

574
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
the example i just gave you in an

575
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,919
equation

576
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,279
and this equation is something that you

577
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
can plug in and you can use yourself

578
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,400
because it's very flexible

579
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,240
so i'd like you to think of the three

580
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
letters t f a

581
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,320
and put an arrow in between each of them

582
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440
so t

583
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
flows to f and

584
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,320
f flows to a and you're going to put

585
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,679
two lines of that so tfa

586
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,279
on top tfa on the bottom

587
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,440
and here's why so t stands for thought

588
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
f stands for feeling and a

589
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
stands for action and sometimes actually

590
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,200
for inaction

591
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,440
so i'll use the example of speaking

592
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,640
so first the negative self-talk i was

593
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,960
saying to myself or the thought

594
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
was i'm not a good speaker or speaking

595
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,400
is just not my thing

596
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,840
how did that make me feel not very

597
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,039
confident

598
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
insecure sometimes feeling a little out

599
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,039
of place

600
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,679
how did it affect my performance or what

601
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,679
action did it have on me

602
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,240
well i would reluctantly take

603
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,320
opportunities

604
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,000
i would not look forward to them and

605
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,799
sometimes i would avoid them

606
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,440
now when you go down to the bottom row

607
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,799
where do i have to start

608
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,120
what do i need to change i need to

609
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,080
change

610
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,799
what i'm saying to myself so instead of

611
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,360
saying

612
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
speaking's not my thing or i'm not a

613
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
good speaker

614
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,039
i had to change it so i want to be a

615
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,679
great speaker

616
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
how did that change the way i felt well

617
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,799
it made me feel a lot more confident

618
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,159
i knew it was going to be a journey i

619
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
knew it was going to be a process

620
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
but it was something that i wanted to

621
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
change so i needed to change the way i

622
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,760
thought about it

623
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,679
and eventually like i said after

624
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,960
practice

625
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,159
and going at it a lot of times i feel

626
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
like i got a lot better

627
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
in a way doing the ted talk was more of

628
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,640
a relief than it was accomplishment

629
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
because i feel like my best speaking is

630
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,760
ahead of me

631
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,440
not behind me so essentially what i did

632
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,039
with that tfa

633
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,080
was i flipped a negative i statement to

634
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
a positive one

635
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,880
and in order to be or or

636
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
be at a level of high emotional

637
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,159
intelligence that's something that

638
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,480
you're going to have to do quite often

639
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,559
because you're going to have doubts

640
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,600
you're going to have things that are

641
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,880
intimidating

642
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
you're going to have things that are

643
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
going to stand in your way obstacles

644
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,440
but the only way to get over them is to

645
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,480
change their mindset with them

646
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
once again emotional intelligence starts

647
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,919
with you

648
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,039
and then it spills over to others

649
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,200
so the best way to approach it in a

650
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,039
systematic way

651
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,080
is to observe what you're doing reflect

652
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
on it

653
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,879
evaluate it then rinse and repeat

654
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
you know using a leadership example in

655
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
terms of emotional intelligence

656
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,840
is the reality is 50

657
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,559
half of a manager's time is spent

658
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,399
dealing

659
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
sorting out interpersonal conflict

660
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,720
so that means if you're working

661
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
50 to 60 hours a week as a manager

662
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,360
that 25 to 30 hours of your week are

663
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,039
going to be spent

664
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,919
with infighting

665
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
customer service problems

666
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,399
your your boss complaining to you about

667
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,840
stuff that isn't getting done

668
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,360
by your team once again i'm not trying

669
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
to scare you away from this stuff

670
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,159
i'm just letting you know that this is

671
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,520
why

672
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
emotional intelligence is a soft skill

673
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
is so important

674
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,480
because as you climb up that ladder you

675
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
actually need more of it not less of it

676
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,399
so the more you avoid improving your

677
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
soft skills

678
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,840
quite frankly the less chance you have

679
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,360
to achieve and get

680
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,640
higher up in your career now i realize

681
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,720
everyone doesn't want to necessarily

682
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,240
peak at a manager's role and that's fine

683
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,039
but think about it in your role right

684
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,520
now

685
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
how often do you deal with people

686
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,799
maybe you work solo maybe you work

687
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,559
contract you're probably working from

688
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,480
home right now

689
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,799
but that only gets you so far you're

690
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,399
gonna have to eventually communicate

691
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,200
with people

692
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
be on a team potentially lead a project

693
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
and if you're gonna do that and do it

694
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,559
successfully

695
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,039
you're really gonna have to improve your

696
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,840
soft skills

697
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
the goal in emotional intelligence

698
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
is to increase your self-awareness and

699
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,080
by doing that

700
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,960
it builds eq

701
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,240
and really the cool part about this is

702
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
that

703
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,320
focusing on your self-awareness is

704
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,760
focusing on something that you can

705
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,720
control

706
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,320
not something that you can't control

707
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,840
so let's summarize what we've learned

708
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,640
soft skills are learned or mastered

709
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,120
through practice and repetition only

710
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
so i like to say that soft skills are

711
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
not learned in the classroom

712
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,720
they're learned in the real world

713
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
so this picture this image that you see

714
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,520
right now is a picture of a gym with

715
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,240
weights in it

716
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,120
and the idea is is that if you want to

717
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
get stronger

718
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,159
there's no diet there's no

719
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,440
overnight program that's going to get

720
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,200
you the results that you want you're

721
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
going to have to work at it

722
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
you're gonna have to put in the reps to

723
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,679
get better

724
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,840
and so with communication leadership

725
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
and emotional intelligence as the three

726
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
that i chose to talk about today with

727
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,760
soft skills

728
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,640
those are things that you're going to

729
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,279
have to practice and if you're not

730
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,720
willing to practice you're not going to

731
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,200
get better at them

732
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,640
but understand that if you're willing to

733
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,159
make the investment

734
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,360
it's going to pay off dividends

735
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
regardless of the industry that you're

736
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,440
in

737
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,200
even if you decide to pivot into a

738
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,240
different industry later

739
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,200
you know there's no substitution for

740
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,640
real world experience

741
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,840
you only get better at human interaction

742
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,799
by doing it so right now

743
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,919
when we're somewhat isolated from a lot

744
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
of the people that we want to see

745
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
i actually think it's a perfect

746
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,600
opportunity for you to practice your

747
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,519
soft skills

748
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,960
maybe you won't get as much practice in

749
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,799
person but like i said before

750
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,440
we're all on zoom we all do virtual

751
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,720
meetings and presentations

752
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,799
hey hopping on a phone call is not bad

753
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,799
either

754
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
if you have to communicate via text or

755
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,840
email you gotta do that too

756
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,760
but if you want to improve your soft

757
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
skills you're going to have to put in

758
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
the work

759
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
you're going to have to put in the time

760
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,600
but understand especially in technology

761
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360
roles

762
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
that technology

763
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
is actually powered by humans they're

764
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,799
the ones who created the technology in

765
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,159
the first place

766
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,480
so as much as you feel like maybe you

767
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
know as an engineer or something that

768
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,440
you don't really need to deal with soft

769
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,720
skills

770
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,399
that's really wrong you do

771
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,480
so some industries i will say that

772
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,960
you maybe don't need as strong of hard

773
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
skills but

774
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,720
every industry in order to succeed at

775
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,159
any position really

776
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,679
soft skills are going to come in handy

777
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,720
so i'm hoping that today you were able

778
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,519
to take at least one thing away

779
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,720
that the importance of soft skills

780
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,279
is something that you can benefit from

781
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,840
for the rest of your life

782
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
that regardless of how things evolve in

783
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,679
your career

784
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,799
or even in your personal life you could

785
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,159
never get to the point where you can

786
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,919
improve your soft skills even more

787
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,880
so i want to thank you for joining me

788
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,799
today

789
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,240
and i hope that you're able to improve

790
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,080
your soft skills

791
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,039
and get those hard results that you

792
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,000
really strive to see

793
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,159
thank you and i'm looking forward to

794
00:33:52,159 --> 00:34:00,000
hearing your progress
