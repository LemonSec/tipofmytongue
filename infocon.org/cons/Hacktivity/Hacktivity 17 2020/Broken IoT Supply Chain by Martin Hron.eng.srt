1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,519
hi everybody

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,599
my name is martin herrera i work as a

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,679
senior security researcher by security

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,039
vendor avast

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,520
and this talk is going to be about

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
broken iot supply chain

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,480
but don't worry it's not that high level

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,359
as it may

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,960
may seem actually it's pretty

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,840
concrete or there is going to be a very

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,280
concrete example

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,000
of one particle iot device that is being

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
broken

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
because of iot supply chain

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,440
so traditional traditionally when we

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
think about the supply chain

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
this this may be

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
one simple example so

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
you've got a box of apples and you need

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,360
to get them

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
to the customer let's traditional

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
producer

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,280
consumer relationship right

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,960
so as it as simple as it seems

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
it's not actually that simple so

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
first of all and foremost someone uh

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
had to create that box right for apples

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
so we have a box com

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,680
factory as an input also

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
someone had to raise the apples

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
so meet joe he's a farmer and he rides

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,119
the apples

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
but to do that he

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
needed some tools right so we have a

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
hardware factory which

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,439
provides him tools he needs to raise the

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,720
apples

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,560
and obviously you already see here it's

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
even more and more complex so

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
the box factory and hardware factory

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,040
they have

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
their own input or inputs in this case

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,240
so in case of a box factory it may be

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
some sawmill so that's that's the source

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,320
of food

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,159
or steel works for hardware factory

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
maybe it's not that obvious from the

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,318
diagram here

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,920
but even the hardware factory and the

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
box factory they have a relationship

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
right because the factor

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
box factory needs tools as well

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
and maybe they also need

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,440
nails for the boxes to be created

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,480
so there are more

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
this is more than like a tree structure

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,599
a

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,800
huge complex network of relationships

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,319
between entities

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
and we are still missing one important

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
entity or

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
one important part here which is the

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,120
transportation

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,599
and we have like all different means of

65
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,720
transportation and

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
all of this basically means there is

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
another

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
supply chain involved and

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,640
maybe the last thing and least obvious

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
is that there is another

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,959
entity that basically that basically

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
is a part of the supply chain and that's

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
a joke because

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
in terms of risk management all these

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,159
relationships and all these entities

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,599
are kind of a risk so if anything

77
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,200
gets broken in that in this chain

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
the chain somehow fail or get broken

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
or won't function properly so every

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
single entity is kind of a risk

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
so from let's move into one specialized

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,480
version

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,799
of supply chain and that's a software

84
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,319
supply chain

85
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
the software chain supply the software

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
supply chain

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
is kind of specific and the specifics

88
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
here

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
is that the transportation

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,000
is much more faster right so

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
in connection in connection with this i

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
personally love this quote which says a

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
lot

94
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
and it's perfectly applicable to

95
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
to the supply chain or the software

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,599
supply chain

97
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
because the software supply chain like

98
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
the analogy with the previous

99
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
diagram could be the developer is joe

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,880
here

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,080
he created creates a code which

102
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,479
gets built uh on a built environment

103
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,240
which could be seen as a farm which has

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
its inputs which are like development

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,360
tools

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,800
operating system open source libraries

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
third-party libraries and even the

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
physical input in

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
in form of a hardware for the built

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
environment and build machines

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,759
itself and the output is

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,800
some software package that's

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
pushed out of the built environment into

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
a distribution server and from there

115
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,039
distributed to the users as i said the

116
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,680
main difference is all these

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
transportation techniques

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,840
are much faster because it's usually

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,720
over wire

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
over the internet and that also means

121
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,639
whenever there is any broken link or

122
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
broken relationship between these

123
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,840
entities

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
it gets propagated very fast you know

125
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,479
that very well especially in

126
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,759
av industry if you push out a wrong

127
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
update to the users

128
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,520
almost immediately many users

129
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
get affected

130
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
so speaking about supply chains you can

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,039
think

132
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,039
uh of risks as a vulnerabilities

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,520
so basically there are i would say two

134
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
types of vulnerabilities in supply chain

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,000
or

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
especially in cyber supply chain if you

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,639
if you want to so these vulnerabilities

138
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,120
are

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
are either intentional or unintentional

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,880
i mean intentional vulnerabilities are

141
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
usually kind of a attack to a supply

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,600
chain

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
or even exploiting the

144
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,080
unintentional vulnerabilities but

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
generally a supply chain cyber attack is

146
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,600
a

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
attack that seeks to damage an

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
organization by targeting

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
less secure elements in the supply chain

150
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,360
network and

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
very often for example to steal an

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,160
intellectual property

153
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
from the company we won't go

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
any further with the supply chain cyber

155
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
attacks

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
we will more because that's completely

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,520
different talk

158
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,319
we will more focus on let's say

159
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,840
unintentional vulnerabilities in supply

160
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,319
chains

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
that are usually present without

162
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
even anybody knows about it right or

163
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,120
knowing about it

164
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,759
so from the one more thing from the

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
perspective of attacker

166
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
like the reason why attackers

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
attacking supply chains and why we are

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,039
also

169
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,800
seeing so huge spike in supply chains

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,919
uh recently is because you get a huge

171
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,560
volume of

172
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
victims very easy very easily

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,759
and with a very reasonable price

174
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,720
sometimes the price is even zero right

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
it depends

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
when you atta where uh exactly in the

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,919
supply chain

178
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,560
are you attacking to so if you if you

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,800
are an attacker attacking to a very

180
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,080
let's say low tiers of a supply chain so

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
that's the place where where let's say

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,080
the upper

183
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,440
tiers share the most

184
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,639
common uh entities or or

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
if you wish components then you'll get

186
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,479
better results you you'll get a huge

187
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
huge outcome out of it

188
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080
so as i said we will focus more on the

189
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
security of iot devices and the supply

190
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,440
chain

191
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
with unintentional vulnerabilities in

192
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,599
this case

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,840
when we're speaking about iot devices in

194
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
general i think we are living

195
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
exciting times uh we are we are

196
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,720
at the brink of of completely new era

197
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,120
because

198
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,440
iot devices are slowly getting

199
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
everywhere

200
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
it's like the the one phase of evolution

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,919
so you can think of it

202
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,360
like there were many different

203
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,440
important events in planets history that

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
basically

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
that basically meant a

206
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,880
huge step either backwards or forward

207
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,920
so maybe the iot

208
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,480
could be one of these events right

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
but i think we got from the evolution

210
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,720
already into a revolution in case of iot

211
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,600
because if you think about it the iot is

212
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
everywhere and we are

213
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
putting more and more

214
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,080
smart functionality into devices

215
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
that don't really need them i think

216
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
that's that's insane like the explosion

217
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,800
of number of iot devices and the

218
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
types of iot devices is really really

219
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,399
huge

220
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
but it obviously comes

221
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,720
with uh with its downsides right

222
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
so speaking of iot we have

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
four main programs

224
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
right now uh because the iot is still

225
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
like from the security perspective the

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,959
iot is still like

227
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,560
in its infancy so we have like four

228
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
most prominent problems out there with

229
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
the iot the first one is out of the box

230
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
problem

231
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
which basically means that many of these

232
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
iot devices

233
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,839
are created in a way so they are easy to

234
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,640
use it's like

235
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
plug and play but there is a problem

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,560
with that

237
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
because that usually works like a

238
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
prominent example could be

239
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
router you take the router out of a box

240
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
connect

241
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
you connect then and lan

242
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,959
interfaces and it just works usually it

243
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
doesn't need any setup

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
so many of these devices uh

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
end up with with the default

246
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
configuration

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
which can be pretty

248
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
risky because if it's a default

249
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
configuration it's

250
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,079
usually documented in manual and if it's

251
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,320
in

252
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,839
manual you can definitely find it on the

253
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,240
internet

254
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
the second big problem is most of these

255
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
iot devices

256
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
are using outdated protocols and the

257
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
reason for that is

258
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,000
probably because most of these protocols

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
came from the pre-iot

260
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
era from from the era of scada

261
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
and industrial automation and

262
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
also at the beginning most of these iot

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,279
devices were

264
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,839
pretty limited in terms of computation

265
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,320
power

266
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,040
i think it's not the case anymore but

267
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,800
still we are dealing with the iot

268
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
devices

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,519
uh which are using for example telnet as

270
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:23,839
a

271
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,600
communication protocol without any

272
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
authorization authentication or another

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
plain text protocols and and that could

274
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
be a huge problem as well

275
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,160
even modern iot devices sometimes they

276
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,480
are

277
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
just equipped with the debug interface

278
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,079
or debug telnet

279
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,640
open unintentionally because some

280
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,000
somebody

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,399
forget forgot to to close it

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
uh there is also the problem of volume

283
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,839
and

284
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
it be and it basically builds

285
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,079
on top of the previous previous two so

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,880
if you have

287
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,079
that poor security in iot devices

288
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,120
and that a huge amount if

289
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,519
out there there is a study which says

290
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,839
that by

291
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,920
2025 there should be around 21 billion

292
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
iot devices out there

293
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
and what it's more important is that 95

294
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
of them will be other devices than

295
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,440
computers and phones so we'll get like

296
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
21 billion devices with no screen or

297
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
almost with no screen

298
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,639
using weird protocols with questionable

299
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,440
security

300
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
that could be a really huge problem

301
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,839
and the fourth problem which we are

302
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,720
interested in

303
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,399
uh in this talk is the problem of the

304
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,040
supply chain so many devices are being

305
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,920
quite labeled or share common components

306
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
and if there is any security failure

307
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
anywhere in the supply chain

308
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
it gets pretty fast propagated

309
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
and will scale at the end the problem is

310
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
we don't have really

311
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,680
proper frameworks uh to

312
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
to let's say do a proper assessment of

313
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,040
every

314
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
input or security assessment of every

315
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
input into our own supply chain or

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,680
into our production so that's that's a

317
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,040
huge problem especially in cheap devices

318
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,240
nobody really

319
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
nobody really does the security

320
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,839
assessment or

321
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,560
any lsa qn qa

322
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
on the output

323
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,920
so this could be a very good example of

324
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
how it looks like so you see three

325
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,360
cameras they look alike

326
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,800
uh you should be thinking these are from

327
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
the same factory from the same

328
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
production light

329
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,160
line the truth is these are completely

330
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
different cameras from

331
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
three different vendors but obviously

332
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,760
they share

333
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,199
common properties and in this case the

334
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,639
common properties here

335
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,480
are the dps of the board inside

336
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
also the os obviously the

337
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
the main cpu which is ingenic t20 i

338
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,920
think

339
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,600
in all three of them and it's obvious

340
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
that they came from the

341
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839
same factory they have the same drivers

342
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
they are built on the same

343
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,800
or similar sdk and

344
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,040
if you open them and connect to a debug

345
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
board you can easily

346
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
or

347
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
or basically you can you can easily

348
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,959
through the debug port

349
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
uh get a route with the same password in

350
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,240
the

351
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,600
all three of them like to a certain

352
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,880
version of a firmware where they realize

353
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,920
that that's an issue and change that but

354
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,319
yeah that's that could be an example

355
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,560
so i like to show this picture

356
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,440
uh during my talks because this is my

357
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,079
mental image how the iot security

358
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,440
looks like and to be fair

359
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
it's getting better i think it's it's

360
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,800
getting better it

361
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,079
we get we are getting like more

362
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,199
new stuff more authentication schemes

363
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,720
proper encryption but still there are

364
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
uh holes and these holes are usually

365
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,120
coming from

366
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,920
the problem of the supply chain so it

367
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,480
means

368
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,519
there are usually

369
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,800
the debug headers non-restricted

370
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,759
debug headers or even the open terminal

371
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,480
protocol

372
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,519
on on device that seems to be

373
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,040
pretty recent and with decent security

374
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,600
or even even the update of the firmware

375
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,959
on the device is

376
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
unsecured even though the device has a

377
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,079
proper

378
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,639
security and uses tls and and

379
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
certificate pane

380
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,440
so we are not still there but hopefully

381
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
we are getting there

382
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
and to illustrate the race of the number

383
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
of the devices

384
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
uh i've done several years i think

385
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,600
three years ago uh i done this research

386
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,519
on mqtt servers that are

387
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,160
widely available on the internet with no

388
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
password at all

389
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
and it turns out

390
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,639
that the number of these servers

391
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
is rising over a year over year

392
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,800
is rising and you can see it

393
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,240
almost resembles the rise of a number of

394
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
iot devices

395
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
and the reason for that might be that

396
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,639
mqtt servers

397
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,920
are usually and very often used

398
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,279
for integrating the iot devices

399
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,800
from different vendors

400
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,079
so now let's get to the main point of

401
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,720
this talk

402
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
and main main thing i want to

403
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,920
tell you the one particle device

404
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
i was speaking of at the beginning

405
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,480
is gps tracker so the gps trackers are

406
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
basically devices

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,319
often targeted at the children elderly

408
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,280
people

409
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,799
or to secure your car or

410
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,880
for you to know where your pet is

411
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,799
and they are often being marketed as

412
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,319
bringing peace of mind

413
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,000
they are usually pretty cheap

414
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,199
these are like examples of these devices

415
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,760
so they

416
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,160
really they really come in different

417
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
shapes and colors and and versions so

418
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,919
you can see there is

419
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,960
like watches for kids uh equipped with

420
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
the gps trickers

421
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
uh there is a gps tracker for your key

422
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,160
rings and

423
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,799
the right one is a gps tracker for car

424
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,160
which has even the ability to

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
control your immobilizer so

426
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,880
you can basically kill the engine

427
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
remotely through it

428
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,039
so the whole infrastructure of the gps

429
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,400
tracker usually

430
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,440
works like this so there is a gps system

431
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,880
with the gps tracker on

432
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
the input the gps tracker communicates

433
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,720
through the gsm or mobile network

434
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,280
somehow

435
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
either through lte or gprs with a cloud

436
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,640
and then on a user-facing side there is

437
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
that web application

438
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,080
or mobile application that user

439
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
uses to control uh the tracker and to

440
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,840
get

441
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,120
to get the data

442
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,880
so inside of the tracker there is

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
usually like three distinct and

444
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,280
important components one is system on

445
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,000
chip or if you wish main processor

446
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
and then there are two modules one is

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
for gps and the other one is for gprs or

448
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,760
lte it depends on the version

449
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
and these are connected together by

450
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
using a serial buses

451
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,039
usually

452
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,720
so let's have a look on one real

453
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,200
gps trigger and its analysis

454
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,120
so we started with this one it came from

455
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,640
ebay for 43 bucks

456
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,360
it was nice package and the onboarding

457
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,559
process itself

458
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,840
is pretty simple but what i like to

459
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,039
mention here

460
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,840
is that for a first use you need to

461
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,639
login by

462
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,600
imei number

463
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
or actually it's not the imei it's just

464
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,440
a part of the

465
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,080
imei so you have some id which is on the

466
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,799
box

467
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,440
and you have to use that to login into

468
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,400
the application for

469
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,360
first time there is a version obviously

470
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,480
for a web

471
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
and then there is also the android and

472
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,440
ios application

473
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,880
what is also pretty interesting is that

474
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
the default password is preset to one

475
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,679
two three four

476
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,880
five six that's exactly the case of

477
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
out of the box problem right uh

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
what's more concerning here is that

479
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,280
user can't really create his or her

480
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
username so or

481
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,919
only the only way how how to create

482
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,679
to create the username you need to

483
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,080
directly contact the reseller to create

484
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
it for you which is kind of a strange so

485
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,960
it's pretty pretty obvious that most of

486
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
the users

487
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
are going to end up with the default

488
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
password and

489
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,520
the id as login name

490
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,400
so when you go to the web application

491
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,799
you

492
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,000
see several red flags already here so

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,799
the web application is over http no

494
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,760
https

495
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,480
is available so anything you type in

496
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,200
goes

497
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,799
unencrypted through the network

498
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,880
when you look into into the traffic here

499
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
you can easily see it uses standard

500
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,240
ajax json scheme for communication

501
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,080
and you can see that after the login

502
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
you'll get your user id

503
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,799
and the device id the device id number

504
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,240
uh doesn't have anything in common

505
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,120
with um

506
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,520
so so this is how it works on the web

507
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
application but we will dive more

508
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
into the into the android application

509
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,679
because this is basically just a subset

510
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,480
of

511
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,240
the what the android application does

512
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
so when you open the interface in the

513
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
lab it looks like this

514
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,320
it's pretty standard you can issue a

515
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
commands to a tracker so you can for

516
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,120
example make the tracker to call

517
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,159
another number or to send an sms from

518
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,640
here

519
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
or you can even upload a firmware to a

520
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,919
tracker

521
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,880
so this is a close-up you see that the

522
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,039
yeah

523
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
i m e-m-e-i-m-e i number sorry uh is not

524
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
uh it's not actually the real number

525
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
it's just a part of it

526
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,559
so that's the id which is on the box

527
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,480
and if you open the tracker you see

528
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,159
there is like the full

529
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,000
ima number and and the id

530
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
just a primer how how the main number

531
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,240
works

532
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,080
uh it's basically very similar

533
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,880
to mac addresses so you have like the

534
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,240
prefixed part

535
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,960
uh which is our order prefix which is

536
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,640
basically allocated by

537
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,159
region by vendor and by a particular

538
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
product then there is six digits of

539
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
serial number which varies among the

540
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
devices and then there is a control

541
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,120
digital control number at the end

542
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,240
so if you map that into a number we had

543
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,679
you see that the 1703 is probably

544
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,080
fixed prefix and all these devices in

545
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,440
the same batch

546
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,480
will share this prefix

547
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
so from that you can also see there is

548
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
one simple attack you can issue

549
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
and that's basically the enumeration

550
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
attack because like

551
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
enumerate through one million possible

552
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,080
serial numbers

553
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
is not that hard right

554
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
so let's have a look into android

555
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
application and its communication with

556
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
the cloud

557
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,080
so this is how it looks like it's pretty

558
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,200
standard again you can log in

559
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
using either id or or your

560
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,480
username and password but as i said you

561
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
don't have a chance to create a username

562
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,919
by yourself

563
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,000
so you are stuck with the device id

564
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
when we put this application into apk

565
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,200
lab io which is

566
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,159
a nice tool we developed a last which is

567
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,840
kind of a

568
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
threat intel platform for android

569
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,600
applications and what it does it

570
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
basically runs the application inside

571
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
the emulator

572
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,080
and create a final report about basic

573
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
features of the application so you'll

574
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
get aesthetic features as well as

575
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,039
dynamic

576
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,720
so you can see here

577
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,279
that sorry

578
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,120
you can see here that it communicates

579
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,480
with this endpoint

580
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,200
so it talks to open api v3 smx

581
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
with the command login and the whole

582
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,200
payload is unencrypted

583
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,919
what's important here you can see as i

584
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,760
said because it's http you can see

585
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
like the the username and password

586
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,799
encrypted

587
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,440
but what's pretty important here is this

588
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
key at the end

589
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,120
and this key is basically baked into the

590
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,919
application

591
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,039
so it's constant it doesn't change with

592
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,600
every login so that's a constantly you

593
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,279
key you need to provide

594
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,799
so after the initial

595
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,320
let's say reverse engineering we

596
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,279
set up a real proxy so we can see the

597
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,480
real traffic or

598
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
from the real application when when

599
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
somebody is using it

600
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,600
and we'll get this wireshark lock and it

601
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,320
basically

602
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
proves everything i said so you can see

603
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
that the open api v3

604
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
is the final endpoint for all the

605
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
commands that the device is able

606
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
to pursue you can see that it started

607
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
with

608
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,320
login 3 version in this case

609
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
and if you look into that particle

610
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,720
http request you can see it's

611
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,919
basically it's basically the post

612
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,840
form we filled

613
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,720
this information and the key at the end

614
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,840
so this this is all you need

615
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,880
to log in into the api

616
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
and because the password is constant

617
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,279
it's 30 yeah this is a close-up

618
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,600
so you can see there the password is one

619
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
two three four five six

620
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,520
the name is the id uh login type

621
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,480
basically just

622
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,679
uh distinguishes between the login by id

623
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,039
or login by username

624
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
and yeah what's important here to

625
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,960
mention

626
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
is the key remember that i will come to

627
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,039
that later

628
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,320
so and this is the response when you

629
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,080
do a login uh against the

630
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
against the endpoint and you can see

631
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,919
you'll get

632
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,360
few more detailed information about the

633
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
tracker which is the model uh

634
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,520
also the model encoded in like

635
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,960
let's say decimal number and then

636
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,159
this key is a session key you should be

637
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:48,720
using

638
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,480
for any other request to the rest of the

639
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
api

640
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,440
so this is for example a way how you can

641
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,919
get

642
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,480
the last position so the get tracking

643
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,520
info

644
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
and by issuing this command or this

645
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,440
request

646
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,679
you'll get for that particular device id

647
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
you'll get this which basically says

648
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
what was the last position recorded for

649
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,000
for that particular device and a bad

650
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
battery status status

651
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,279
uh okay so let's have a look

652
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,600
how the tracker actually talks to a

653
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
cloud because that's another path

654
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,480
we are quite interested in right so what

655
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,399
are the options if you want to sniff

656
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,960
this traffic actually there are several

657
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,399
options to go

658
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,960
pro probably the most obvious is to set

659
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
up your bts station

660
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,760
to slip the traffic but

661
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,960
you can do that definitely but

662
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,240
uh we found out that there

663
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
are uh more let's say

664
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
there are easiest way uh

665
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
to go and we decided because the tracker

666
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,640
was

667
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,760
pretty big and was uh like nice

668
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,320
like the pcb was nicely accessible we

669
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,720
decided to sniff the serial bus between

670
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
the gprs modem

671
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,679
and the main cpu and because

672
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,240
all the data that goes to the cloud they

673
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,799
the data has to go through the gps modem

674
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,919
as well

675
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,480
so we opened the tracker and we found

676
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
out that there are two sets

677
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,679
of test pads nicely

678
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,880
labeled so it turned out that one of

679
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,080
these

680
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,320
one of these sets is for gps modem and

681
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,720
the other one is for gprs modem so by

682
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
trial and error

683
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
we found the right one and got all the

684
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
traffic

685
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,120
between the modem and the main cpu

686
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,760
but at the end it turned out that there

687
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,320
is

688
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,960
even easiest way to go or easier way to

689
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,919
go

690
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,399
and we found out in a documentation

691
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,640
pretty interesting sms command

692
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
because the trigger can be set up by

693
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
sending an sms to it

694
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,399
so you can basically by issuing this

695
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,520
command

696
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,279
set up and cloud endpoint so basically

697
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,360
you can set up an ip address on the port

698
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,159
where all the platform the tracker goes

699
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,120
so that was

700
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,679
the easiest solution for us right so we

701
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,360
set up a proxy again

702
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,159
uh we use that sms to change to change

703
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:30,880
the api

704
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
ip address and board and the tracker uh

705
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,000
sent all data through us to a cloud so

706
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,880
we got

707
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,679
all the traffic very easily without like

708
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,520
dismounting the device

709
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,000
and what we've seen here is another

710
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,360
plain text

711
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
so it turned out that the whole

712
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
communication protocol

713
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,240
is basically based on this texts or

714
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,600
comments

715
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,760
and you definite what you definitely

716
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,279
what you can't see here and actually

717
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,960
what's not here

718
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
is any kind of authorization

719
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
there is no password at all and you can

720
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,960
see it's pretty obvious what the command

721
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,840
does

722
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,520
so you see the id at the beginning then

723
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
size of the comment itself and the

724
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,039
comment in this case

725
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,559
this command tells the tracker

726
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,520
to call to deal up this particular

727
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,000
number

728
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,720
and make a voice call to this number so

729
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
just by issuing this command you can

730
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
easily

731
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,120
spy on the owner of the tracker

732
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,399
and using different various commands

733
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,520
like this

734
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
uh you can basically even spoof the

735
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,279
location of this record you have

736
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,480
if you if you manage to get into or tap

737
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,159
into the communication between the cloud

738
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,760
and the tracker you are

739
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,480
on full charge and you can you can do

740
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,200
whatever you want

741
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,120
so and as i said at the beginning

742
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,200
because uh

743
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,399
we did that sequential or enumeration

744
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:04,880
attack

745
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,399
on that prefix just to have a

746
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,799
clue how big the problem is for this

747
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,840
particle

748
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,080
vendor we found out that there were like

749
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,960
231

750
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
000 devices with default passwords and

751
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,159
for

752
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,720
160 700 000 we were able to obtain the

753
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,360
last

754
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,559
gps location i also turned out that

755
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,360
there are

756
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,240
29 different models of trekkers so this

757
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,200
cloud is

758
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,679
is being used for different all the

759
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,200
different versions

760
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,799
uh that this particular vendor

761
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,840
sells so this is just

762
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
just a big

763
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,039
variety of devices we are

764
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,760
talking about

765
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
and this is a map for this one

766
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,080
particular vendor you can see

767
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,399
there is not many of them in the united

768
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,000
states but

769
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
these devices are definitely being used

770
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,600
out of

771
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,640
china as you can see

772
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,159
there are pretty heavy load of them in

773
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,679
europe as well

774
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,360
and when you put that api endpoint we've

775
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,799
seen in previous slide

776
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,919
into slides into a browser directly

777
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,279
you'll get this nice self-documenting

778
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,720
ui so basically it gives you all the

779
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
commands that the

780
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,200
cloud infrastructure is able

781
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
able to able to do

782
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
and there is also a link to basically

783
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,679
this uh confirms to

784
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,720
a soap protocol so you can using tools

785
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,039
for

786
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,039
soap you can basically get the whole api

787
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,360
very very easily

788
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
so there is one important thing

789
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
here so as i said at the beginning there

790
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
is the session key you need to put to

791
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,799
every command of the api after the login

792
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,279
so you need basically two numbers

793
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,559
because the time zones

794
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,799
doesn't really matter you need a device

795
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,039
id and then the key

796
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,559
the problem here is that we found out

797
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,760
that if you put the baked

798
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,039
in key instead of a session key

799
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,480
it works too and in case of this command

800
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,559
it gives you a nice overview of

801
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,200
all the pictures taken by this

802
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,039
particular gps tracker because in this

803
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,000
case it was a gps

804
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,720
tracker with the camera and also also

805
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,320
very convenient

806
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,159
image url you can get all the pictures

807
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,600
so basically it reduces only to knowing

808
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
the id of the particular device but

809
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,120
because

810
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,360
the ide is again only six digits long

811
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,240
you can easily enumerate all of them

812
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
which is a huge problem

813
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,960
and by diving deeper into the

814
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
applications

815
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,359
uh we were trying to find uh

816
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,159
application with the same static baked

817
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,399
in

818
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,440
key and it turned out that there is like

819
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,280
or there are like 75 of these

820
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
applications

821
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,839
in our database already

822
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,760
so that basically uh means

823
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,679
that there is probably more to this

824
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
story so

825
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,800
it seems that this cloud infrastructure

826
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,399
is not used just by this particle vendor

827
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,879
so we did a kind of a hack we did a

828
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,079
virtual research

829
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,719
on this particle device so basically

830
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,320
what we did is

831
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,440
we found some another tracker on the

832
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,639
internet

833
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,679
and just by trying

834
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,560
to get the home page and trying to get

835
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,119
the money

836
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,440
from the internet without like really

837
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,599
getting the device itself we

838
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,079
tried to assess the security and find

839
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,880
out if

840
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,400
it shares the same cloud so

841
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,200
we found the application on the home

842
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,359
page there is a link to a gps tracking

843
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
system which is the web version and

844
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,240
also to android application so it was

845
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
pretty convenient

846
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
we dive into analysis right away because

847
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,640
we didn't have any like

848
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,920
real id to use we just

849
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,200
typed in like random number into a login

850
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,240
form

851
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,880
and we were trying to see what what's

852
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,960
gonna be the traffic going out of the

853
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
application

854
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,040
so this is the application we put there

855
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,560
we put there our fake

856
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,560
id uh and

857
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,119
this is this is the analysis uh from the

858
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,400
ipk lab io

859
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,520
and you can see here a thing that

860
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,200
basically proves our suspicion

861
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,520
that the name of the endpoint seems to

862
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,680
be same open api v3

863
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,640
smx

864
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,599
so we open that url and

865
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,839
you can see it's almost identical

866
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,440
identical to a previous lender

867
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,920
and if you dive more into a manual

868
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,400
manual or the leaflet

869
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,040
for the tracker you can even see there

870
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,440
are

871
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
similar sms commands that basically set

872
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
up the endpoint

873
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,520
for the fully tracker

874
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,200
so we started to be suspicious about how

875
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,720
all of this working so we tried

876
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,040
the first thing that that basically

877
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,599
also on our mind which is basically

878
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,320
searching

879
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,680
the google for open api v3

880
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,000
and it turned out that there is a lot of

881
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
links

882
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,160
indexed by google to a different uh

883
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,880
let's say vendors and versions of that

884
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,000
cloud

885
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,520
and we found this one where the browsing

886
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,800
was allowed so

887
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,520
we got a pretty good picture about how

888
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,680
the whole thing works

889
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,160
you can see there is even like the log

890
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,200
log either the

891
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,240
log directory and the directory with the

892
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
zk images which in fact contained the

893
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,880
images from the trackers

894
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,760
so it was browseable we got everywhere

895
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,079
we

896
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,800
want to and we were particularly

897
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,599
interested in

898
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,320
logs because this is usually a very good

899
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
source of information

900
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,359
so we opened one and there was some

901
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,560
exception information record but what

902
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,040
was

903
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,480
interesting for us was so it

904
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,839
was this particular information which

905
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,760
tells us the name of the binary

906
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,400
that basically runs or operates the

907
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,119
whole

908
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,880
whole logic so it seems it's a

909
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,640
asp.net library so we did it again

910
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,320
uh google is our best friend we tried to

911
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,880
find

912
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,839
find another websites that share the

913
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,800
same properties

914
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,160
and it turned out we found another

915
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,079
site with the browsing allowed so we got

916
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,520
all the binaries from there

917
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,160
and by putting them into either we found

918
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,920
out that there is one particle binary

919
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,400
which

920
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,440
is named sent comments

921
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,440
dll which basically contained

922
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,640
a lot of supported models

923
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
of gps trackers and their protocols

924
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
that basically means that this

925
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,160
api and this cloud infrastructure is

926
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,800
very

927
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,640
i would say thorough and it

928
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,359
implements a lot of different models so

929
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,480
it's heavily

930
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
compatible with all the hardware on the

931
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,240
chinese

932
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,280
market and from that

933
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,640
we deduce is this name of hardware

934
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,599
manufacturers

935
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,800
and affected mobiles

936
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,520
let's get back to an api for a moment

937
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,160
remember this so you can see there is

938
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,720
that

939
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,359
user account id but this is somehow

940
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,440
strange right because we didn't create

941
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,560
any user

942
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
account because there is no possibility

943
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
how to do that so i was quite curious

944
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,680
what

945
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,440
this is what does this mean right

946
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
so it turned out there is an

947
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,599
api function that tells you a user info

948
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,800
by user id

949
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,599
so we put there the user id and again

950
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,920
the pre-baked key

951
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
and the output was like this now you can

952
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,359
see it's definitely not

953
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,160
my account or account of my tracker but

954
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,960
there is

955
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,359
there is this login name right

956
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,119
so once you put that login name into a

957
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,640
login form

958
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,119
in this case login by an account

959
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,800
you'll get this so basically you get

960
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,520
the administration interface of a vendor

961
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,640
who sells these

962
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,720
trackers and you can do whatever you

963
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,760
want from here

964
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,480
you can export everything to excel you

965
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,040
can

966
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,560
reset the password you can even charge

967
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,240
the user if there is

968
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,280
any charge policy or if it's running on

969
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,400
lte plan for example

970
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,040
this is really really really bad and you

971
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,160
can see

972
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,800
there is that there is that number of

973
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,920
trackers for that particular vendor

974
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,880
which is like

975
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,400
10 000 trackers

976
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,599
so we were trying to reach out to vendor

977
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,079
but unfortunately they didn't respond

978
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,200
but they were

979
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,640
slowly fixing the issues anyway and we

980
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,760
found out that

981
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,880
they introduced this dialogue so

982
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,720
whatever you are trying to use the

983
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
password one two three four five

984
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,040
six it asks you to change the password

985
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,960
or even if you are creating a

986
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,040
or if you are logging for a first time

987
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
it basically makes you to to change the

988
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,920
password

989
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,800
so from there's our site this should be

990
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,640
problem solved right

991
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,280
but the program here is the api is still

992
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,319
vulnerable

993
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,560
so if you use the get a device list for

994
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
example with the username id

995
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,400
or with the user id in id here and the

996
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,160
pre-baked key again

997
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,359
you'll get again a list of

998
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,800
all trackers that belong to

999
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,079
that particular vendor or user

1000
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,359
so you can see here is like 13 000 of

1001
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,240
them

1002
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,160
in a nicely formatted json

1003
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,200
json file

1004
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
so we concluded that there are

1005
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,640
approximately 500 models and 30 plus

1006
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
cloud instances

1007
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
these share the same api and

1008
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,000
vulnerability

1009
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,640
and from that we roughly roughly

1010
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,359
estimate that

1011
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,400
this affects almost 5 15 million of

1012
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,240
devices

1013
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
and so this is a map of just a quick

1014
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,079
scan of another word

1015
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,200
vendor so you can see in this case there

1016
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,520
is

1017
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,359
a lot more devices in america's or

1018
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,160
in the united states and south america

1019
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,480
in general

1020
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
and it also turned out that this is not

1021
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,319
a problem not only

1022
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,040
just in china because we for example

1023
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,200
found this tracker which seems to be

1024
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,680
pretty decent you can buy it on amazon

1025
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,400
it's almost

1026
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,839
best seller it for at the first site it

1027
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,240
uses https

1028
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,000
but if you run the analysis you'll find

1029
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,040
this endpoint which is not called

1030
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,880
open api anymore it has another prefix

1031
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,640
but the content is again the same

1032
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,079
and all this led us to a company

1033
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,280
that basically is behind this all

1034
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,800
and the company basically runs

1035
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,520
the cloud infrastructure or on-premise

1036
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,000
provides

1037
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,040
the infrastructure to vendors or

1038
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
resellers

1039
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,200
and everything is basically documented

1040
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,599
here

1041
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,200
even the protocol itself which is

1042
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,640
like the open api version three

1043
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,680
and there is really no no

1044
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,880
mention like no security at all there is

1045
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,520
even like like there is basically no

1046
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,800
security if you run through the

1047
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,640
documentation

1048
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,680
it really doesn't have any security

1049
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,440
and the most concerning thing is that

1050
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,640
down on these pages you can find

1051
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,400
this proclamation that for the moment

1052
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,319
more than 200 enterprise customers

1053
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,680
across the world

1054
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,599
chose our software and over 7 million

1055
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,200
gps devices

1056
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,680
were registered on our server and that's

1057
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,240
the information from 2004

1058
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,359
14 so you can you can see that

1059
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,200
the issue is really huge

1060
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
okay so how to conclude this talk

1061
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,480
actually i wouldn't

1062
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,800
i didn't put any conclusion here because

1063
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,880
the research is still ongoing

1064
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,040
right now we are cooperating with more

1065
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,400
researchers who are

1066
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,800
basically doing very similar research on

1067
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,400
different other companies

1068
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,640
but it seems that the program is really

1069
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,680
huge and

1070
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,920
all of this should just illustrate

1071
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,040
how bad the situation is and how

1072
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,319
our supply chain in this case

1073
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,839
can lead to a very serious

1074
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,880
security consequences and issues and i

1075
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,359
would say

1076
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,800
at a huge really huge huge scale

1077
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,920
okay so i hope you enjoyed the talk

1078
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,599
even though it was like back with the

1079
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,200
information and

1080
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,400
i'm a little bit over time so

1081
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,880
if you have any questions don't hesitate

1082
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,040
to reach out to me either directly

1083
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,319
or wait for a q a session here

1084
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,520
at the activity conference thank you

1085
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,839
very much
