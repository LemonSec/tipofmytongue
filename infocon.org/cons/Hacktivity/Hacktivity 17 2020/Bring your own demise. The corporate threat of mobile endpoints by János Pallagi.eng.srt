00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,240
hello activity my name is janusz pologi

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,920
and i will be talking about mobile

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,919
threats and mobile security for the next

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,559
20 minutes

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
this is me i am a security researcher at

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,120
whitehead id security

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
where i do incident response malware

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
analysis digital forensics

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,199
and i like to take part in vulnerability

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,439
research projects as well

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
i'm an instructor of whitehead certified

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
defect training

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,720
which is our enterprise defense training

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,000
and we are really proud of

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,079
it i also have master's degree in

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
mathematics and the twitter account

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
let's begin with a short disclaimer

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,480
during the talk

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
i will be using software and tools

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,520
developed by the imperium

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,840
but feel free to substitute your own

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
favorite mobile threat protection

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,079
software

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,320
whenever you hear or see zips or

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
imperium mentioned

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,920
because the adversary tactics and

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
techniques that are showcased here

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,239
are applicable regardless of what

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,480
defensive solutions you have

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
also while we are here i would like to

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
thank and give a huge shout out to

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
richard from zimperium who helped me

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,080
create this demo and presentation

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
with that being said let's jump right

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,760
into our topic of this talk mobile

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
devices in corporate environments

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,560
not too long ago a typical corporate

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,520
network was like a hard-boiled egg

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
the yolk being the internal secure

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
network with the dmz

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
and the perimeter around it and the

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
internet being the wilderness it is

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,560
in those times if we had a decent

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
overpriced network firewall

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,360
we were fine but how about now

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,439
when company assets started to move to

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,720
the cloud

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,000
first websites accounting ticketing

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
and then project management file sharing

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
collaboration tools virtual machine

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,320
machines

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,479
and so on and then the users they are

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,520
working from anywhere but the office

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
mainly they are working from home yep i

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,799
said working from home now you can check

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,640
it in the conference bingo you're

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
welcome

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
so basically no more assets no more

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
users in the internal network

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
well we can obviously force them to use

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
our corporate vpn

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
to make use of our overpriced firewall

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,599
and have some visibility

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,560
but what we can do with mobile devices

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,520
also

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,840
does our network now look like a soft

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,959
boiled egg

68
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,239
well nope it looks like a scrambled egg

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
a very scrambled egg

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
but wait we've heard this a couple of

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
thousand times already

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,000
the bad news is this paradigm won't

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
shift itself

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
and also saying identity management or

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
zero trust policy in the mirror three

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,599
times

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
won't prevent adversaries from attacking

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
your assets employees or users

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
but what we can do to protect assets

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
that are accessed from mobile devices

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
if the devices company should mobile

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
device management solutions can be

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
deployed

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
but honestly no one really likes having

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,120
two phones at the same time

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and giving smartphones to every employee

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,159
is often not even feasible

88
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,239
so let's look at the case in the bottom

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,519
right corner

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,680
this is the most dangerous and at the

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
same time most common case

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
personal devices with company access

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,080
those are used for corporate emails

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,879
instant message

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,319
messaging collaboration banking

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,400
two-factor authentication or

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
authenticator apps

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,799
company social media accounts and the

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
list goes on

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,720
of course we could prohibit employees

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
from accessing any company resource from

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
their own smartphones but

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,799
let's face it almost no one is willing

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,599
to do that

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
because productivity i mean

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,879
we have whole fields and departments

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,080
even like i.t

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
risk management for example because iit

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,200
security

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,159
among other things is sacrificed for

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,879
productivity

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
yes but how does blockchain solve all

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
these issues

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,358
it does not moving on

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,919
so really what we can do

116
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
because so far it is advantage to the

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
attackers

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
but to understand how we can protect

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,919
mobile endpoints first

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
we should know what the attackers could

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,759
do

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
if only there were a collection that

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
enumerates

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
adversary tactics and techniques for

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
mobile endpoints

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
but hey there it is so enter the matrix

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,840
namely enter mitres attack matrix from

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
mobile

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
while there are a lot lots of adversary

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
techniques around

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
these are the ones i wish to showcase to

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,320
you today in the demo

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,880
this demo scenario covers almost all

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
steps in the mobile field chain

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
here are the techniques but don't worry

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
they will be back during the demo

137
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,120
so this week in pre-recorded live demo

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,160
please keep in mind that this is a

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
simulated

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
attack so the time frames are not going

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,320
to be

142
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
realistic and while there is endpoint

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
protection on the vulnerable iphone

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,160
we are attacking let's just assume there

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
is not

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
this demo simulates a targeted attack

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
where the initial access is through a

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
rope wi-fi access point and dns spoofing

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
and it goes the whole way in the kill

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
chain

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
we know and we can imagine most of the

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
attacks today

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,319
are not targeted and almost exclusively

154
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
start with some kind of phishing

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
and ultimately social engineering users

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
into installing malicious apps

157
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,199
i also have to mention that no banking

158
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,960
accounts were harmed during the shooting

159
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,000
of this demo

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
so without further ado let's see the

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
speed run of

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,000
10 techniques in less than 10 minutes

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
this is why we are here

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,759
after all let's hope the gods of

165
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
pre-recorded live demos are with us

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
today

167
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,919
so we have the vulnerable iphone of nick

168
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,479
cash

169
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,720
who is the cfo of the victim company

170
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,479
called acme corporation

171
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,960
as we can see the device is kind of okay

172
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,840
except the vulnerable ios version

173
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,840
so let's fire up our rope wifi access

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
points

175
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
let's give a nice name to our network

176
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,159
personalized to our target of course

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,280
and as we have the stronger signal the

178
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
victim connects to our access point

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
and we have the first technique

180
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,880
of course zips detected instantly but

181
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,479
for the sake of this demo let's

182
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,240
ignore these alerts for now

183
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,199
so the access point gave an address to

184
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
the phone and

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,479
let's just type in for our backdoor

186
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,319
later on

187
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
and while the spoof domains are all

188
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
reset

189
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,479
if nick visits a website nothing happens

190
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,479
unless it is one of our spoof domains

191
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,599
and we spoofed acme.com which is

192
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:41,838
nick's own corporate domain

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,040
and now nick browses to acme.com

194
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
and this lures our victim to install the

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
contact tracing app

196
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
they are developing but

197
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,600
this app also jailbreaks the phone which

198
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
involves persistence

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
elevation to root naturally

200
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
as you can see there's persistence

201
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
privilege escalation

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
too bad they don't have protection

203
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
installed otherwise

204
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,000
it would scream that the device is

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
already compromised as you can see

206
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
all the threat logs triggered by the

207
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,519
exploit

208
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:51,839
in the app

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
we also have a remote shell we have the

210
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
highest privileges already

211
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
so now we can do virtually everything we

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,279
would want

213
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
but this is a hacker conference i don't

214
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,320
have to tell you this right

215
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,000
moving on moving on to our compromise

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
device

217
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,000
let's gather some data like

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,440
whatsapp messages

219
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,399
this example shows that end-to-end

220
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,760
encrypted channels

221
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
have at least two weak points they are

222
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,279
the

223
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,680
two ends obviously now

224
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,000
now we know some personal stuff about

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
nick as well as some

226
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:47,839
trade secrets

227
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
and of course if we check what's up on

228
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
the phone

229
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,519
you would see that these are in fact the

230
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:15,839
messages we just saw

231
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
and while we are here dumping some

232
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,160
wi-fi passwords are easy now

233
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,360
just like collecting the contact list

234
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
which we

235
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
will use in a minute

236
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,399
now and this is really frightening

237
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
we see that nick has a banking app on

238
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,320
their phone

239
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
so let's send them a spoofed email and

240
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
see whether nick opens the banking gap

241
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
or not

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
of course we could just launch the app

243
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,760
but that would be rather suspicious i

244
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
guess

245
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,040
checking if nick saw the message

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
yes this is this is robin's scammer from

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,519
cbd bank so this must be legit and also

248
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
urgent

249
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
um

250
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
we take a screenshot to see if nick saw

251
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
the message and

252
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
yeah they saw the message

253
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,519
and now nick opened the banking app of

254
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,079
course

255
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,120
real mobile malware has this screen

256
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
capture feature

257
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
automated of course but

258
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,639
we can see the app is open so we can use

259
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,040
our

260
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,439
final technique login keystrokes

261
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
so we hook the app with the keylogger

262
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,399
some of you probably have already seen

263
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,320
keyloggers being used on desktop

264
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
environments

265
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
but i hope seeing this on a smartphone

266
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,880
live

267
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
is more unique and interesting for you

268
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,519
now we see that nick meets the password

269
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,560
complexity requirements

270
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,720
and also they have two-factor

271
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,920
authentication enabled

272
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,760
but to beat two-factor authentication

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,720
we can kill the app at the right moment

274
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,199
and

275
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,279
wait for the message to arrive with the

276
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:02,079
one time password

277
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:17,839
it is so we collect these as well

278
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
and of course whenever we wish to log in

279
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,399
with nick's

280
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,800
credentials again all we have to do is

281
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
capture the screen or

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
read the message with the one-time

283
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,760
password and

284
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
sadly the same goes for authenticator

285
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
apps

286
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,720
that uses that use the the six-digit

287
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,959
one-time password so

288
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,360
for this case i recommend using the

289
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,839
approve feature of authenticator apps

290
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
ah here is the second

291
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,240
one type password

292
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
and finally we choose adam smith

293
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,160
from the contact list we just acquired

294
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:13,839
and sent him an email

295
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
notice that we are not just spoofing

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,560
nick

297
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
the cfo of this company but

298
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
we are nick when we send this message to

299
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
adam no logs will be able to tell that

300
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
this message was sent

301
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
with malicious intent as there are no

302
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,120
access

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,199
and security logs from this device

304
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
this message contains a link and we are

305
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,800
supposed to fish

306
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,839
adam's credit card data by the way

307
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,240
i guess this counts as lateral movement

308
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,959
but we already have the 10 techniques

309
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,839
in the bag

310
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,839
meanwhile here's adam and his android

311
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,560
device

312
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
he got the message from his boss

313
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,439
and when he reads it

314
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,399
more closely when he reads it

315
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
and

316
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
perhaps the arbitrary phishing link

317
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,519
we've just sent

318
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,399
is endpoint protection alerts instantly

319
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
too bad nick didn't have zips installed

320
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,959
i guess

321
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,279
because we would see the whole picture

322
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,720
through the threat logs otherwise

323
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
like this

324
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,079
so this was our pre-recorded live demo

325
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,359
and um i don't have much time left

326
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,160
so here are my conclusions and takeaways

327
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,599
for you

328
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,720
as we could see zips stopped or could

329
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,079
have stopped the attack at

330
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,039
basically any step in the kill chain

331
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,319
second of all

332
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,679
no visibility hurts the most and

333
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
most companies have no visibility

334
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,119
regarding

335
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,799
their employees phones being used

336
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,919
for accessing company resources

337
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,400
and to make things worse here here are

338
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
some stats for you

339
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
so 50 of company resource accesses

340
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,880
are from mobile devices already and this

341
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
will only raise from this point

342
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
also of all devices 60

343
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,120
are mobile devices namely smartphones

344
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
and among these smartphones majority of

345
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,480
these

346
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,799
have operating systems after their end

347
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,840
of life support

348
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,720
so they are we they will be always

349
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,360
vulnerable

350
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,039
another conclusion if mdm is out of the

351
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,840
question

352
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,760
at least consider using some

353
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
containerization solutions

354
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,840
like samsung knox and finally

355
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
endpoint protection is not really

356
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,000
effective

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,760
unless you have the logs and alerts

358
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
collected and analyzed

359
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,520
by trained and experienced security team

360
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,559
and i believe it's go time because the

361
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,679
next presentation

362
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,840
will be about reversing malware written

363
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
in go

364
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,160
and with that thank you all for watching

365
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
and listening

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,000
if you have any questions my twitter dms

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,720
are open

368
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
you can find me on linkedin and it's

369
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,080
really hard

370
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
really not hard to figure out my company

371
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
email address either

372
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,480
so have a nice conference everyone
