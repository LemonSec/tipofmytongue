1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,000
state of the art fishing my name is six

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
and i'm an ethical hacker and my hobby

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,719
and also job involves a lot of phishing

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,679
attacks

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,039
and also my main topic is i.t security

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,080
awareness

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
this is how it came to my mind that

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,840
activity

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
would welcome this kind of presentation

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so let's jump into uh the topics and

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
what i am going to present to you

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,680
i will start with a short introduction

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,160
to

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
give you the basic idea of fishing and

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,320
generally social engineering tricking

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
humans

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,239
then we go through the basics and look

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:48,960
at some

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
examples of mass fishing what is

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,879
happening nowadays how it is happening

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,719
and how you can use this

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,079
examples to build your phishing

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,760
scenario for a penetration test i will

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,960
show techniques here for both

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,560
the technical and non-technical people

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
so both groups will understand what i

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,119
will speak about

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,520
but i will not give you copy-paste

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,560
examples

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,560
to avoid the abuse by script kits

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
so you will see the techniques you will

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,600
see how

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
it works but if you want to do the same

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,920
ethics

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
i am presenting you will need to do it

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,680
yourself

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,960
and take effort into them we will look

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,680
into

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
wishing techniques which is nowadays

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
becoming a biggest threat

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
or an even worst threat compared to what

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,720
it was

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,399
a few years ago then we will go through

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
smishing look into the security of

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
sms messages and how you can bypass

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,799
multi-factor authentication if

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,119
this is used then the next one will be

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
a full fishing scenario when we are

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,920
going for the big fish

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,879
or the ceo in the past it was called

52
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,840
seal

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,760
fishing or coffroud nowadays it

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,120
is more commonly called whaling then we

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
will look into

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
excel macros because five years ago or

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
something like that that was quite a big

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,519
trend

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,720
and see if it still works and if it's

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,760
still a valid attack vector in 2020

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,879
then you will get the references

62
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,000
repositories links

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,239
and useful tools that you can

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,160
use after this presentation or read

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
other phishing examples to

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,599
educate yourself or people around you

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,360
so let's see what do you think what was

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
the oldest trick in the book

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
when we are speaking about fishing i

70
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
give you a few seconds there to figure

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,640
out

72
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,239
and you might remember amazon this

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
is the the example i'm bringing to you

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
i think everyone around my age

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
had this screen on his windows machine

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,879
back then

77
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
and received similar messages and

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
the funny part about that this kind of

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
phishing attacks where we just send the

80
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
url we don't even need to you

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,519
say a sentence just drop the url

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,720
by statistics this is one of the most

83
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,519
successful fishing vector in 2020 still

84
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
people are curious and those who are not

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,959
educated

86
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
against phishing then they will not

87
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,319
know they shouldn't click they will

88
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,360
click and they

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
will even try to login into the

90
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
phishing page if it looks like a website

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,519
they are familiar with maybe a company

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,159
website

93
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,238
they work for or well even facebook or

94
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,720
or google and this is how the statistic

95
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,280
looks like

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,840
so out of 152 34 submitted data

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
and this was just an attack without any

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,520
big

99
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,800
effort doing anything that is like

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
taking a lot of time it was just really

101
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,199
sending an email to those people from

102
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
goldfish which is like a really good

103
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,440
tool

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,240
and i recommend for those who are doing

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,160
fishing campaigns

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
and yeah that sounds pretty nice and

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
well the presentation could stop now

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,840
because

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
yeah that's fishing that's how easy it

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,120
is right

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
well not actually this is an interesting

112
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,199
um this is an interesting example

113
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
on how to do fishing and it works a few

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
times

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
but if you are really going for a

116
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
serious fishing if you want to do spare

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
fishing

118
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
and and do something very very advanced

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
then this is not the technique you will

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
use but this is a good

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
technique for introduction

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
so let's see the mass fishing and its

123
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,199
state

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
what is happening nowadays where do all

125
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,479
those

126
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,000
spam and other messages come from

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,320
in many cases those attackers and now

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
i'm speaking about mostly

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
about the bad guys the blackhead guys

130
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,919
who are sending the emails

131
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,600
they are using cloud services or hacked

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
servers

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,039
or anything they can have access to

134
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
most of the cases these are not advanced

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,240
attacks

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,319
and just many script kits

137
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
most of them i i think are are script

138
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,759
kids because

139
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,720
they can't even configure their email

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
servers

141
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,919
and they send messages that are

142
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,360
giving you the uh the errors

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
that the authenticity

144
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,440
is not bullied and so on i will give you

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,479
some examples

146
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,199
from my fishing collection in the next

147
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,080
slides

148
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
but if they are a bit more advanced

149
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
maybe they use the cloud services

150
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
because these are more

151
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
trusted by the companies and by the

152
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,360
people

153
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,000
think about an example where you have

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,199
google drive

155
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,960
or onedrive used in the company

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,319
i think a few companies maybe

157
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,160
have the one drive and because of

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
its microsoft service and microsoft is

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,680
pushing to

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
use it for the companies and then if

161
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,280
they are

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
storing their malware their their final

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
payload on the on the cloud services of

164
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,759
onedrive

165
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,039
then this can be quite a pain to

166
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,160
avoid that so

167
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
let's move on and see some examples

168
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,000
and let's see what's going on

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,880
so google drive onedrive dropbox google

170
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
sites and so on they saw work

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,479
for storing your malware on that if you

172
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,160
are doing the fishing

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
and if you are the bad guy and if you

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
are a good guy you can also use days

175
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
for your penetration test and

176
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
this is an idea on how you should do

177
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
when you go for such a

178
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,759
such a test so first of all you don't

179
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,639
want to

180
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,199
store your payload on the email you are

181
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,840
sending

182
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
back then it was the practice but

183
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
nowadays it doesn't work anymore

184
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
you should use a decoy document or make

185
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
some redirects

186
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,479
or or do something not to

187
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
immediately send it with the email

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
because

189
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
all the endpoint security antivirus

190
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,759
software and or filters everything is

191
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,360
looking deeply into

192
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
the email itself it is not really a

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
practice anymore to just

194
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
drop the attachment and please open it

195
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,000
uh

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
it will be code it will be

197
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
going to the junk and spam folder most

198
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,919
of the time so it's too risky to do that

199
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,320
but if you are using a decoy document

200
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
through cloud provider

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,559
or you make some redirects there is a

202
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,120
new

203
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,399
really clever idea also where

204
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,320
the attackers send the

205
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
google search url to the victims

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,279
and the google searchers shows you

207
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,560
results which actually leads you

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,000
to the fishing payload or the fishing

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,959
page

210
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,160
it can be done with some little seo

211
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,720
tricks

212
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
or if the website is hacked and

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
it already has some reputation so it's

214
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
mostly the bad guys tool but if you are

215
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,000
a whitehead guy then you can

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
still use that if you are

217
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,120
if you have time to build such a

218
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
seo for your website

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
so if you go

220
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
with the configuration of phishing mail

221
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,160
servers there are a few things

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
you should know and you should

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,959
not miss even the smallest configuration

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,560
otherwise you will easily get

225
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
blacklisted or get into the junk folders

226
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
especially it's hard with the microsoft

227
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
products because

228
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
they do not just put you the

229
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,279
phishing attacker into spam they even

230
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,240
put the

231
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
legitim senders to the spam if it is not

232
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,120
coming from their

233
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,839
uh own system they they just don't like

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,040
anyone or i don't know

235
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
what is the reason even if

236
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
i try to contact them i didn't get any

237
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,760
um

238
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,800
any answer from their side so

239
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
you have to be very good in configuring

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
your servers and you need a reputable

241
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
provider if you are using a vps

242
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
you will get an ip address from the

243
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,480
provider pool

244
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,800
and if it's an ip address that was

245
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,279
abused 100 times in the past

246
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
then this won't be a good address for

247
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,680
you

248
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
also true for the domain you need a good

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,959
provider

250
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,880
because some security

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
companies also check which

252
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
provider the domain is uh is from

253
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,040
so you need to need to make sure that

254
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,760
this are

255
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,040
in the correct place rtfm

256
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
very import important read the manuals

257
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,959
because nowadays

258
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,240
less people do that and if you are

259
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
configuring

260
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
your own things you really need to know

261
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
what exactly you are doing

262
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
so take time and read how to do it

263
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
why you are doing it why it's important

264
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
and

265
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
and be very careful with that

266
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
of course you will need a certificate a

267
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
tls certificate

268
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
um third boot let's encrypt can help you

269
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,399
for that

270
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,079
and you need to configure spf and ptr

271
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,240
you can be sure that without days all

272
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
your mails will be

273
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,440
sent to the spam folder dkm

274
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
dmarc also important but

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,839
if you do not configure it probably you

276
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
won't get into spam just because of that

277
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
but this this gives you a good

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
or a better reputation for sure when it

279
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
comes to you

280
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,200
where your emails are landing

281
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
and you should generate some legitimate

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,639
looking

283
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,600
traffic for sure not too many emails but

284
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
if you get some answers from

285
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,880
people that legitimate addresses

286
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,160
uh to google hotmail and so on then

287
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,120
it will also help your reputation to be

288
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
to be better

289
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,519
and not to get into the spam and

290
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,560
also you need to wait one month

291
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
because if you are not one month

292
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
old with the server and the domain and

293
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
the configuration and whatsoever

294
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
then you are very likely to not

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
be trusted by any providers

296
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
my experience is that actually it is

297
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,600
easier to

298
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
fish companies who host their own mail

299
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,519
servers

300
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,120
if you are sending phishing mails to

301
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,839
to like google and hotmail and this kind

302
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
of services

303
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
because unfortunately smaller companies

304
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
in many cases use use these services and

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
and then if you are doing a test for

306
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
such a small

307
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
scale company then it happens that you

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
might need to send

309
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,200
phishing to gmail and it will be harder

310
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,880
a bit than than really the company

311
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,480
filters so

312
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
some very simple examples from

313
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
nowadays or from this year at least

314
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,199
so this is just the standard uh

315
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,519
phishing email i receive hundreds of

316
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,320
those

317
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,959
it's from twitter to verify your account

318
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,880
otherwise it will be

319
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
disconnected from the server it's really

320
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
general

321
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
nothing to speak about this is an

322
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,600
example where

323
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
they could not even send it

324
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
correctly it's not just flaw it just

325
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
it wasn't just arriving to spam it even

326
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,320
told me that

327
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,040
the message is involved this so this is

328
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,600
a

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
very unprofessional configuration or

330
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
or this is this is what you want to

331
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
avoid

332
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
this kind of messages

333
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,959
this is a standard story this is a

334
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,959
kind of phishing that they want you to

335
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,079
answer

336
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
and then they engage you in the

337
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
discussion and in the end

338
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,720
they will get to the point where

339
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,160
they ask for information and

340
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
here is my favorite they tried to

341
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,199
translate probably an english text to

342
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,399
hungarian

343
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,079
but hungarian is not an easy language

344
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,360
so they failed there really hard

345
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
because well if you are hungarian you

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
probably figured out that

347
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,639
there is no not divert passport or

348
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,680
or anything like this but which

349
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
a hungarian person would not know what a

350
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,880
posser is because it's not a valid

351
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,160
hungarian word

352
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,920
they try to translate if you are male or

353
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
female or or the sexy itself but

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,279
they actually translated it literally to

355
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,160
sex

356
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,920
so yeah this this was probably not

357
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,440
their best try but this was i think the

358
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,959
second or third email

359
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,120
which i received from them it's my

360
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,199
practice nowadays that i answer to this

361
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,519
emails to see just what happens

362
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,560
i do it from this mailbox and

363
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,920
funny things like this happen sometimes

364
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
okay so let's look into wishing

365
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,680
so wishing is basically the

366
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
same thing as fishing but over voice and

367
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,839
nowadays

368
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,759
it is become becoming a more

369
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,240
uh more of a threat because

370
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,360
it is not just a normal coral

371
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,279
animal anymore it's uh using now

372
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,639
ai if i want to use any buzzwords and

373
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,800
also machine learning and so on

374
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,399
but in fact they use

375
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,920
the fake voice which is actually an

376
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,519
open source tool uh which you can find

377
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,639
on github

378
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
diffic and then you are able

379
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
with some trickery if you spend enough

380
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,360
time

381
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
playing or with deep fake then you will

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
be able to

383
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,399
imitate other people's voice replace

384
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,000
their faces

385
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,279
on the on the on the videos and so on

386
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,160
so if you will follow the relevant

387
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
articles

388
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
down there you will see two examples

389
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,720
one of them is how twitter was hacked

390
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,160
and how wishing was used in that

391
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,319
case and the attackers

392
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,359
got the access that they were looking

393
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:09,679
for

394
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,640
actually so wishing is nowadays really

395
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,039
uh

396
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,520
becoming a scary thing for the companies

397
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
and of course the old-school wishing

398
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,000
techniques that i am from microsoft

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,039
and you have a virus on your computer

400
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,559
so please install any desk or install

401
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
a teamviewer give me access to your

402
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,120
computer so i can fix your virus

403
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,400
then this kind of scam also

404
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,640
is on the trend in different countries

405
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
probably it is more common nowadays

406
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,360
where

407
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
people speak english or that's what i

408
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,200
guess

409
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,960
but for sure it happens in hungary we

410
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,679
don't have

411
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,200
a lot of days because just as in the

412
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
previous examples hungarian is not an

413
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,960
easy language so we are more lucky with

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
that

415
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
and of course in many cases the callers

416
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,039
spoof ids so they can also trick

417
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,200
support teams so an example is to

418
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,640
call a company

419
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,080
which is providing some services to the

420
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,200
target which has an account you want to

421
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
get into you spoof your caller id

422
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
you call the uh company support

423
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
after you have collected all the

424
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
information about the target

425
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,480
like an example with the previous emails

426
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
or you did some pretext thing and

427
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
and so on somehow you figured out his

428
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,400
name birthday

429
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,720
signature how it looks like and so on

430
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
and then caller id

431
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,440
comes into the picture

432
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
mostly there are darknet services which

433
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
are providing this kind of spoofing

434
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,320
but if you are actually doing legitimate

435
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,240
legal penetration testing and you have

436
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
the contracts and

437
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,240
and the authorization you can also do

438
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
this kind of

439
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,640
color id spoofing in some cases in some

440
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
countries

441
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
so it's doable as a penetration tester

442
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,039
too

443
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,919
and the last one not really wishing but

444
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,840
the worst to mention is when they just

445
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,559
call you

446
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
and wait for the callbacks and when you

447
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
they when you

448
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,840
call them back you will have a really

449
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
expensive bill to pay at the end of the

450
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,559
month

451
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,480
so this is just another trick it is also

452
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
more on the illegal side of the of the

453
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,039
topic so uh let's not jump into that

454
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,480
it's also not really

455
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,919
into wishing so it's just something i

456
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,000
wanted to mention there for you

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
that this also exists smishing

458
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,039
and bypassing multi-factor

459
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,000
authentication

460
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
sorry for the picture it was a gif where

461
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
the guy is

462
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,559
basically rapidly typing messages and

463
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,440
spamming

464
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
but it looks like that this

465
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,039
gif is not opening on my linux

466
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,960
pdf viewer so

467
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
if you are interested in the gif contact

468
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
me and i will send it to you

469
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
alongside with the fuelings huh so

470
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
uh basically similar cones and

471
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
techniques like standard fishing

472
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
but the trends are a bit different they

473
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
are mostly looking the bad guys

474
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,799
for social media accounts like uh one of

475
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,840
the biggest trend

476
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
now is instagram and they are sending

477
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,120
you the text messages that hey

478
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
you should log into this page with your

479
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
instagram profile

480
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,200
instagram fake page pops up they try to

481
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
log in

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,919
and then if you have multi-factor

483
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,760
authentication then there is another

484
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,799
message

485
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,520
and then they ask you again to type that

486
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,000
message

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
in and then you will type the message

488
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
into the

489
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
into the fake page and bom account

490
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,760
stolen

491
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,280
so yes this can also

492
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,679
happen with standard phishing and this

493
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,559
this is

494
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,360
something which you can do uh for a

495
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
bypass of multi-factor

496
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
but the environment users are using

497
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,600
their phone it's more handy for them

498
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,799
to get into these tricks

499
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,760
and get trigged when they only have the

500
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,679
phone in their hands and they are just

501
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,440
typing so

502
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,080
this is just the common things there are

503
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,559
more

504
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,080
interesting examples and especially

505
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,960
this year we had a few stories in

506
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,919
hungary

507
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,520
where the attackers stole one of the

508
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,559
attack was like nearly a hundred

509
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
thousand dollars attack and the other

510
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
one was

511
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,320
a bit more than that maybe 130 something

512
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,280
like that but

513
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
the po a lot of money that's the point

514
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,200
and they were targeting

515
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
people who were trying to

516
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,559
buy houses or in one house per person

517
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,600
so what was happening

518
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,159
in the first case the attacker asked the

519
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,200
client to install any desk on the

520
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
machine

521
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
because the the guy introduced himself

522
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,320
that he

523
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
is an it professional so i am an iit

524
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
professional so please install any desk

525
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,559
and give me access to your computer

526
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,480
please do that

527
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,520
then the victim did that

528
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
so that was the first

529
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,799
part and the victim didn't realize that

530
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,440
something bad is going on at that point

531
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,240
so they

532
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,360
took all the data because of that trick

533
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,880
and then they had to do some sim

534
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
swapping which is basically

535
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
going to the telephone or mobile

536
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,679
provider giving you the documents

537
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,200
they request and then

538
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,720
you say okay i bought this new sim card

539
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
and please transfer the phone number to

540
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,559
this new sim card

541
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,799
and then they do that if you

542
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,400
authenticate yourself

543
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,520
as the legitimate person

544
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,039
and then the other sim card will stop

545
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,679
working and probably that was the point

546
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
where the victim realized that something

547
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,440
bad is really going on

548
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,039
when his phone got silenced

549
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,440
because the attackers got the phone

550
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
number and because they had access to

551
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,320
the

552
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,760
computer also they could all steal the

553
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
passwords and all the data

554
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
which they used for the sim swapping

555
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,440
attack

556
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,039
so they stole all the money

557
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
through bronc transfers and cash outs

558
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,679
at atms so that's how

559
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,200
it was it this is an attack which

560
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,320
maybe sounds simple but it actually

561
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
takes a lot of preparation

562
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,320
and and the attackers were very clever

563
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
with that and the similar case is

564
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,120
happened

565
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
uh if you follow the links below sorry

566
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
for the hungarian but

567
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,760
i could not find any any english

568
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,360
versions of those

569
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,640
but our hungarian

570
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
guys maybe maybe they will translate it

571
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
for you but i

572
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
told you what was happening in a

573
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,880
nutshell is just

574
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,880
with more information at this urls

575
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
so basically you can ask users to

576
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,320
type the code they received to the

577
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,360
phishing sites

578
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,080
and that's that's the that's the bypass

579
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
if you have

580
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,320
password managers and

581
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,120
if you have hardware keys for

582
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
multi-factor authentication

583
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,400
it is nice but still if the users are

584
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,720
not

585
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,120
ever what they are doing and you ask

586
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
and you ask them to give access to their

587
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,559
computer

588
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,720
and you give them the access they will

589
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
also use

590
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,960
their multi-factor authentication keys

591
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,600
to

592
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,320
to let you into their account so there

593
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,240
will be always a trick for that

594
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,559
so they they must be aware of what they

595
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,440
are doing

596
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
but that's on the defense side which i'm

597
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,279
not going into

598
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,320
the point is that even if you have uh

599
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
multifactorator indication then this can

600
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
be triggered

601
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,279
in some ways it is harder but still

602
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,919
possible

603
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,279
and it is still happening so we are

604
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,400
going from the

605
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
for the big fish sent from my iphone

606
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,000
it's an example of a signature

607
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,240
that helps you to make more successful

608
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,039
fishing campaigns if you are going for

609
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,240
the big targets

610
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,039
because i have seen many cases where

611
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,799
high value value

612
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,400
cc targets send emails

613
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,360
with just sent from my iphone so if you

614
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,480
just

615
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,880
fake their sender or you register

616
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,360
gmail address with their name and some

617
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
numbers at the end

618
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,600
then you will be able to send messages

619
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,400
like them

620
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
so it's another funny thing but it

621
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,039
will work against those targets who have

622
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,640
low level of awareness okay let's say

623
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,480
they are a bit more ever so we are not

624
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,039
going with

625
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,559
such an easy scenario

626
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,880
so first of all we need to decide the

627
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,840
objective

628
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,640
what do we want to have what is the

629
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,919
point

630
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
in this case i chose not the standard

631
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,600
and

632
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,120
cliched finance phishing because

633
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
you will have information about that

634
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,520
everywhere

635
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,000
but a topic which is inside their

636
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
trading

637
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,360
that topic is not really

638
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,840
emphasized as much as it should be i

639
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,640
think

640
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,399
because this is a real thing this is

641
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,080
happening and

642
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,600
there is even a black market or more

643
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
black markets on the dark net if you

644
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
look around

645
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,080
and their goal is to get insider

646
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,440
information

647
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,399
so you should be careful about this

648
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,360
topic

649
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,880
and you should definitely do fishing

650
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,080
and and educate people

651
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,200
about that and

652
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,320
education is the best when you when you

653
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,080
make some practice with them and you

654
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
fish them and show them the results and

655
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,720
then they will be

656
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
more resistant so what we are looking

657
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,919
for

658
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,039
is the ceo's email account

659
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,159
webmail probably uh we do not know at

660
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
objective zero or or

661
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,039
decision the zero step because

662
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,279
we just tell us what we want to do

663
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
so we are looking for the contacts the

664
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,120
company

665
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,159
connections the plans maybe org

666
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,440
charts what they do when the price goes

667
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
up when the price

668
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,520
goes down what are the estimates so we

669
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,240
we want

670
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,919
information from the ceo why the ceo

671
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,480
because

672
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
probably he has the more and the most

673
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,799
value

674
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,919
able information for us or maybe there

675
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,159
is a fallback which is his assistant we

676
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,919
do not know yet we will go through the

677
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,799
steps

678
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
and and we will figure out maybe it's

679
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,320
enough to

680
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
hack the assistant's email account and

681
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,240
then

682
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,440
she or he will have all the information

683
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,000
that

684
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,399
the ceo has because this is really

685
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,679
common that

686
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,360
they know more or less the same things

687
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,559
so after we have the objective what do

688
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,919
we do

689
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,240
what kind of preparation do we need to

690
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,120
know so we do some

691
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,640
some awesome uh some some search on the

692
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,520
internet

693
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
for the company its connections who do

694
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,600
they work with

695
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,039
public conferences facebook

696
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
twitter all the information that we can

697
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
collect and figure out who is who

698
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,440
and who we should uh who we should uh

699
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,320
think about when we are building our

700
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,200
phishing

701
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,679
email so after we have collected the

702
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,000
the available publicly available

703
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
information

704
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,399
then we look into the target environment

705
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,840
that means we can for example send some

706
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,360
emails to the hr department that

707
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
we are really really enthusiastic and

708
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,559
want to work for your company

709
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
at the ux team or

710
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,640
maybe at the finance team or wherever

711
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
but the point is that you

712
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,039
send some messages them that you want to

713
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,720
work there maybe you should

714
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,480
even ascend uh fake not maybe actually

715
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,919
you should send

716
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,520
a fake cv to them the

717
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,320
fingerprints their environment so we you

718
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,520
will know

719
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,640
their versions of some software

720
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,080
pdf reader or you will

721
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,200
maybe figure out if they use the

722
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880
office 365 or they have another version

723
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
if they use windows or not or

724
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,840
maybe mac many of those nowadays use mac

725
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,960
2.

726
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
if you are lucky maybe you will be able

727
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,080
to

728
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,159
figure out what kind of antivirus they

729
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,279
use and so on

730
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,320
so you can go a little bit deeper

731
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,200
by messaging people and if you get into

732
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
an email conversation

733
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120
with them it's also great because you

734
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,000
can

735
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,360
see what kind of signature the company

736
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,000
uses

737
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
then you will be able to to copy the

738
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,760
signature

739
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,799
so this is just by not doing anything

740
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,559
but talking to them

741
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,240
mailing chatting on lindy maybe and so

742
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,960
on

743
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
you will figure out if you are doing

744
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,279
this kind of job as just a few ideas

745
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,000
the point is to get as much information

746
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,360
as possible

747
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,840
and

748
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,320
okay so you have got all the information

749
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,600
and then we move on evaluation of the

750
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,480
information

751
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
that was collected now we figure out who

752
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,840
we attack okay the ceo in this case now

753
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
we collected everything we figured out

754
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
that we know a lot of things

755
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,679
favorite restaurants where he goes

756
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,440
friends because he shared everything

757
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,039
publicly on facebook

758
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,039
so we all know all the things

759
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,080
but these were

760
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,279
now not enough to build a good scenario

761
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,840
there is an even better scenario which

762
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,039
is about

763
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,480
mandatory texts reporting at the end of

764
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,399
the year and we are actually

765
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,360
at that time and all the companies are

766
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
afraid of that and they are preparing

767
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,320
and so on

768
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,600
so you can build up a really good

769
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
phishing email

770
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,159
based on text reporting if you

771
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,559
have some signatures collected from the

772
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,159
company or

773
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,720
from other companies they work with or

774
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
maybe you

775
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,960
find some templates how the text

776
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,360
report request looks like which is sent

777
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,080
to them

778
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,200
then this is the email you you can

779
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
send to them so we decide to go with

780
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,720
this

781
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,799
this text phishing email and we say the

782
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,039
following

783
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,159
dear ceo we

784
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,440
there is there is this text reporting

785
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,200
for the company which is mandatory

786
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
and we see that you haven't

787
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,399
prepared the preliminary documents

788
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,519
and it is very important to stay

789
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,440
in time so please login on this url

790
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,039
and verify that you are

791
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,279
the authorized authorized person

792
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,399
in the company and blah blah blah

793
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,919
so there is some more

794
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,240
there there are some more messages it's

795
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
just something that was coming out

796
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,080
of my mind now but there are like a lot

797
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
of

798
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,320
ways to to play around this text

799
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,399
reporting is just one example

800
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,039
the point is that we send the url to

801
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,679
their

802
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,720
webmail or actually to the

803
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,880
phishing page which is their

804
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,240
webmail login looking like page

805
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,880
so that's something we copied and

806
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,919
prepared

807
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,960
for the for the delivery

808
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,599
and then we just wait until he logs in

809
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,839
well if this is prepared really well

810
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,359
and if the text reporting

811
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,960
and the message is sent at the right

812
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,159
time and not just at this

813
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,199
right day but the right time at the day

814
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,159
so you can figure out if there are like

815
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,760
higher workloads

816
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,239
at different times in the company and

817
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,280
maybe

818
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,719
it is better to send the email

819
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,159
on monday at 10 a.m because

820
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,239
there are like a flood of information

821
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,159
and people are last ever

822
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,879
at those times if you are sending it on

823
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,760
wednesday afternoon they will be

824
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,000
probably more ever because there is less

825
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
workload it's it's just something

826
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,240
general

827
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,880
i'm saying but this is an experience

828
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,200
that this is how it works in many cases

829
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
also another interesting time to send is

830
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,240
the

831
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
end of the work on friday because

832
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
everyone wants to go home

833
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
and they just click on that and log in

834
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
and okay

835
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,839
i have done what i need to do i i logged

836
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,960
into this text

837
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,560
reporting whatever it was verified and

838
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:22,880
now

839
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,359
i go home i do not care and then you

840
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,640
will have the whole

841
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,000
weekend for you as an attacker to

842
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,880
do something with the with the access or

843
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,200
well

844
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,200
in our case write the report because

845
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,240
we do not experience exfiltrated data as

846
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,400
we are penetration testers

847
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
but we do report it

848
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,880
so that's the point basically

849
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,240
so all the things that i have described

850
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,599
in the basics and the and the mass

851
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,640
fishing

852
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,599
this can be used and should be used as

853
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,320
techniques

854
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
when you are doing spare fishing the url

855
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,599
direction

856
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,720
cloud services all the things to

857
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,680
avoid getting detected and in case of

858
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,000
spare

859
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,440
fishing you should prepare much more on

860
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,040
on what you send and when you send and

861
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,839
how you send

862
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,760
so what about excel macros as an attack

863
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,280
vector in 2020

864
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,079
so this is not as easy as five years ago

865
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,280
or

866
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,720
even more years ago octavirus

867
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,400
software even report those files that

868
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
are unarmed full

869
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,400
for example i tested with cog.hexa and

870
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,359
powershell.exe and so on

871
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,160
if you just pop those then you will be

872
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,880
flagged by

873
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,079
antiviruses if you are using auto open

874
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,240
then you won't be stealthy at all so you

875
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,200
should be

876
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,000
avoiding using the auto open function

877
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
which is an excel

878
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,800
macro function so you should make sure

879
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
that the user will click on at least a

880
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,599
button

881
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,040
in excel itself and in the workbook

882
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,079
otherwise you will again get easily

883
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,920
detected

884
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,880
well in the end it is still a feasible

885
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,000
vector

886
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,480
but you need to do some obfuscation and

887
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,200
the tricks

888
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,040
and again you should not uh send the

889
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,680
payload

890
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,119
itself that executes in the attachment

891
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,800
and in the document

892
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,400
itself so how to

893
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
do the bypass and how to make it still

894
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,920
working

895
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,320
well in very short and my time is also

896
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,440
running out so you create a

897
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,960
obfuscated vbs script which downloads

898
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,280
and

899
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,480
executes your final payload which can be

900
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,520
an exa but maybe there are some other

901
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
productions in windows you need to

902
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,200
bypass but that's out of the scope now

903
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,240
so you you add this

904
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,000
obfuscated vbs script into the macro

905
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,680
which writes the vbs script into your

906
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,160
profile

907
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,839
directory that executes it so

908
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,200
basically three steps if we

909
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,400
even look into more into that

910
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,440
is that first create

911
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
document an excel document which is

912
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,680
macro enabled

913
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,520
then add a script that writes the vbs

914
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
script into profile for the folder and

915
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
executes it

916
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,920
and this script that you are executing

917
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,720
now

918
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,000
downloads the final payload and executes

919
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,720
it again

920
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
so that's how it works and that's how

921
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
you can avoid

922
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
most of the aoes if you want to cheat

923
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,359
here

924
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,359
is a url and and an article

925
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,200
about how to do that that's also

926
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,320
where i got the idea from for the vbs

927
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,119
part you can

928
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,079
use other languages it's not just vbs

929
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,960
fortunately

930
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,920
windows is really flexible on that so

931
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
you can be even more clever

932
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,560
but if you just copy paste this example

933
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
from the

934
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,720
from the article you will get a 10 of 55

935
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,760
so in most of the cases just

936
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,280
being lazy works on that one

937
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,640
okay here is the example i just

938
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,040
did the same as in the article and

939
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,119
uploaded it to virustotal and that was

940
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,960
the result

941
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,200
so here are the references i recommend

942
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,320
you to

943
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,000
download the slides and then you will be

944
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
able to

945
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,200
go through the links

946
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,880
so just for the end

947
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,640
give a man a zero day and he will have

948
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,359
access for a day teach a man to fish and

949
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,440
he will access for life

950
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,880
it's from twitter i really like this guy

951
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,200
and you can defeat them in video and

952
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,720
exploit also true

953
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,000
i just wanted to leave you as

954
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,720
uh something that maybe give you some

955
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,359
cheers

956
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,960
and some other thoughts so thank you for

957

if you have questions feel free to ask

960
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,599
here because you can do it

961
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,240
i think on a zoom or something but at

962
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,839
this

963
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,400
activity i will be available

964
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,960
