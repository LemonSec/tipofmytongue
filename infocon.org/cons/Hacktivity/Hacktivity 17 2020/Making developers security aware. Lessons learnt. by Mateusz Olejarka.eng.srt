1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,840
let's go back in time to the year 1940

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,960
and german plans to invade france this

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,440
here

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,599
is the ebony male fort a belgian

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,759
stronghold at the albert canal

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
this stronghold was meant to stop german

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,120
troops on their way west

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
by destroying nearby bridges if

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,119
necessary this complex was considered

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,640
one of the best fortifications of its

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,039
time

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,880
alongside the imaginal line and the

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,960
siegfried line was it possible

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,279
to capture this stronghold without a

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
long siege

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,000
well it was a very difficult task almost

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,040
impossible

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
at least the builders fought that way

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,160
and it was

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
assuming the enemy will strike from the

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
certain bearings

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,480
and the strike would be done by the

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,200
ground forces the germans proven that

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
assumptions

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,160
wrong on 10th may 1940 at 4 30 am

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
42 u 523 m aircrafts took off

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
each one was towing a dfs glider with

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,440
paratroopers

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,719
almost 500 paratroopers in total 10 of

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
those gliders carrying around 90

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
paratroopers

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
were meant to capture the fort itself

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
and the rest of the forces was dedicated

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
to take control over the three bridges

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,080
near

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,280
the fort it was the assault battalion

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,760
cough

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
unit they forced more than one thousand

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,680
defenders to surrender

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,360
and capture two of the three bridges

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
opening the way west

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,119
for the german sixth army why was that

43
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
possible

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
from the ground side the fort was well

45
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,720
protected

46
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
here we have the canal on the right side

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,320
on the left

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,439
there is a river around the fort we can

49
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,479
see barbed wire

50
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,040
and trenches but the evidence malford

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
had only one anti-aircraft station

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,360
having just four machine guns so a weak

53
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,240
spot reason

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,720
number one no one suspected that the

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,920
paratroopers would appear

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,799
already inside the fort landing right on

57
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,159
top of the defenders

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
using those gliders red dots on the map

59
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,799
marked the landing spots so an element

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,520
of surprise

61
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
reason number two the paratroopers

62
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
immediately attacked all entrances to

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
the fort and blew up our gun turrets and

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,040
cannons

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
to do that they used a new type of

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
explosive hollow charges more precise

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,200
and powerful reason number three

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
we can find similarities with this story

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
when we look at the i.t security or

70
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
application security world

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
in my opinion companies when dealing

72
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,160
with application security try to rely on

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
tools and products too much

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
news often show us that there is usually

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
something which was missed

76
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
and the bad guys still end up in the

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
middle of someone's fault

78
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
like those paratroopers in my opinion

79
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,519
companies tend to forget about the

80
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,000
people

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
which i believe are the most important

82
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
asset in the application security

83
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,280
hi my name is matteo saleh i am senior

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
i.t security specialist at securing

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,440
most of the time i do web application

86
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
security

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
testing more and more i work also with

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
software development teams

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,879
to help them with application security

90
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,160
in sdlc

91
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,239
i'm co-author of the security over

92
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,200
developer workshop

93
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
which is main reason behind this talk i

94
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,239
will share with you

95
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,280
lessons i learned about the apsec when

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
i or my colleagues were giving this

97
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
workshop

98
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
the concept behind the workshop is

99
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,319
purely defensive we do not teach

100
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,840
developers how to paint us web

101
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
applications

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
but we show them vulnerabilities cause

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
the effect

104
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
and then we let developers invent

105
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
possible fixes and security improvements

106
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
we focus on the security awareness and

107
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
fixing mindset

108
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
when i was creating the content i had my

109
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
concept how application security should

110
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,879
look like

111
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
in the organization as a former

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
programmer i had the advantage of

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,799
knowing how typical software development

114
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
looks with this concept i went to my

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
first edition

116
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
three years ago and this concept evolved

117
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,440
quite unexpectedly during those three

118
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,319
years

119
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
based on the discussions we had during

120
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
more than

121
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,239
70 workshops already i wanted to share

122
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,519
what i learned about the

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,439
upset from the developers so

124
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,720
uh let's jump to lessons

125
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
communication is bad lesson one

126
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
this picture shows one of the most

127
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,799
devastating attacks on u.s troops in

128
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,680
history

129
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
the pear harbor getting to bad

130
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,200
communication first

131
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
there were reports which indicated the

132
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,880
possibility of an attack which did not

133
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,199
get

134
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
the priority high enough second there

135
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
were orders issued

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
which stated that the japanese attack is

137
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
possible which did not mention per

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
harbor specifically

139
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
so neither troops disposition nor the

140
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
readiness level

141
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
was changed finally the incoming

142
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
japanese planes were mistakenly treated

143
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
as friendly bombers which were supposed

144
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
to appear

145
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
in that time frame during my journey as

146
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
an application security consultant

147
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
i had a lot of complaints on the

148
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
security people from developers

149
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
let me quote a few

150
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
they do not understand how we work

151
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,520
they do not reply on our emails you have

152
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,639
to wait a long

153
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
long time until they eventually help you

154
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
they say make it secure but not how

155
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
exactly

156
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
they speak their own tlas three-letter

157
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,199
acronyms that only die

158
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,240
understand of course security people are

159
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
not the only ones to blame here

160
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
developers are guilty also if you

161
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,039
as a security people want to work

162
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
effectively with developers

163
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,360
it has to end maybe no ship will sink

164
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
and no one will die if bad communication

165
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,560
will continue but it's toxic environment

166
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
to work in any way

167
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,759
communication is a skill we all have to

168
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,639
master

169
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,560
it's one of the most important skills in

170
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,520
idea of the future

171
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
so you should drop your cubicles for a

172
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
while go out from your anonymous

173
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
mailboxes security at something

174
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
and meet developers play whatever game

175
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
they play right now in the office

176
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
drink coffee tea or other poison of

177
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
choice

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
or do that remotely now then and only

179
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
then you can hear things

180
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
but they struggle with inapsec these

181
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
stories might scare the out of you

182
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
or might not but there's only one way to

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
find out

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,479
is just go and talk work on timing

185
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,919
respond quickly cue your task

186
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
accordingly today priority

187
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
and remember that others might not be as

188
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
fluent in absence as you are

189
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,919
and communicate clearly with appropriate

190
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,520
amount of details

191
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
always ask questions if this or that is

192
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
clear and explain

193
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
if not that's the catalogue of things

194
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:28,960
you can do

195
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
to improve communication not only in

196
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
application security of course

197
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,039
well well well who knew security is not

198
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,960
in my job description

199
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
this is the second lesson the most

200
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,240
surprising one for me

201
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
this picture presents a polish anti-tank

202
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,160
rifle pattern 35

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
rifle was a successful weapon capable to

204
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
penetrate armor of any german tank

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
used during the invasion of poland from

206
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,280
the distance less than 100 meters

207
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
his deployment to troops was under

208
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
strict secrecy

209
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
weapon was delivered in wooden boxes

210
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
disguised as measurement gear

211
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
on 15th july 1939 the order was issued

212
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
instructing to train selected soldiers

213
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,240
and officers with the weapon

214
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
number of available rifles was around

215
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
three and a half thousand which sadly

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
was not enough

217
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
it was such a good weapon that the

218
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
germans included it in their arsenal

219
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,960
and those very rifles were used during

220
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
the assault on eben and mr ford

221
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,000
why you mentioned the rifle because of

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,039
the secrecy

223
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,520
the order to open those boxes which came

224
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,199
late and finally the small amount

225
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,240
available

226
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
in a few companies i visited i saw the

227
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,759
security department seen by

228
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
developers as an oppac secret big

229
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,360
brother

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,160
which is always watching the security

231
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
guys are definitely watching raps

232
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
they sometimes say it's a myth

233
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
i tried vividly to destroy it sometimes

234
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,440
also

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
the application security was seen

236
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,960
strictly as something which developers

237
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,039
are not responsible for

238
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,639
i think this happens when you build your

239
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,000
trenches of another department

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
compartment whatever

241
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
and those anonymous made boxes mentioned

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,800
before

243
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,039
i2 security department is not almighty

244
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,000
though it's probably

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
understaffed and enemy forces have the

246
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
advantage it's hard to protect every

247
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,199
place and never changing a dynamic

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,400
battlefield

249
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,479
the issue here is the developer's

250
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,080
attitude which is usually

251
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
i don't care or

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,160
i don't have time for security

253
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,599
although i met developers which

254
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
understood the need to work on security

255
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,479
side of their apps

256
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,279
they were badly outnumbered i think it

257
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
heavily depends on the company they work

258
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,919
for as well

259
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,839
from my experience there is a big

260
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,360
difference between people

261
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
building crypto exchange and people

262
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,920
doing some internal apps

263
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,600
so how do we fix this

264
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
yeah you have to win their hearts and

265
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
minds and

266
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,120
recruit them to the application security

267
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,839
cars

268
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,080
developers scrum masters product owners

269
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
devops

270
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
all people involved all of them

271
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
first as a security people you should

272
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
explain exactly what you do

273
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
and also what you do not i should

274
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,959
help on guide developers because

275
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,760
developers

276
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
are the main force behind the secure

277
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
applications

278
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
how to spread this idea and this

279
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
knowledge across a company

280
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,279
there is variety of activities possible

281
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,720
sit yourself nearby

282
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
the developers in the office run

283
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
internal events either conference

284
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,279
hackathon

285
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
meetup maybe even again internal black

286
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,560
bounty with small prizes

287
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,920
explain what responsibilities you have

288
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,439
and make other people understand it

289
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,640
lesson 3 is about a supposedly silver

290
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
bullet

291
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
during the world war ii american air

292
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
force faced an interesting life and

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
death problem

294
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,480
not all bombers and all fighters

295
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,279
returned to base after a combat flight

296
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,120
on the picture you can see the results

297
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
of a study

298
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
where aircrafts which returned were

299
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
mostly hit

300
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,399
the solutions to the problem seems to be

301
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:06,880
easy

302
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
and straightforward put our armor on

303
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,399
wings and hull

304
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
and there you go a statistician abraham

305
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
walt pointed out that planning

306
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
improvements in armor based on the

307
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
planes that returned from combat flights

308
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
was badly flawed because the most

309
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,279
sensitive components might be the ones

310
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,320
not

311
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
that were not discovered in the study

312
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
because the planes which took damage

313
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,399
there simply did not return to base

314
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,240
this is the survivorship bias when you

315
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
take your data without considering if

316
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
there can be some unknown reasons

317
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,279
which make your data set

318
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,839
non-representative

319
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
so do not focus on what was found think

320
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
also what could have been missed

321
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
and yet penetration testing or security

322
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
testing is considered as enough

323
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
to make an application secure the truth

324
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,079
is

325
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,279
it is not enough why

326
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
in all kinds of testing not all bugs

327
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
will be discovered

328
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
most of the time we do not test the

329
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
whole application so issues can stay

330
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
undetected almost always there is

331
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
something in the application

332
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,480
which is not working so it gets excluded

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
from the scope

334
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,440
let me ask you this if you run a

335
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,000
penetration

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
testing of an application once a year

337
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
and on the other hand

338
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
you deploy changes and new features into

339
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
production daily

340
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
how secure is it really

341
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
i'm fixing just before the production

342
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,839
release can be costly too

343
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
to sum up penetration testing is an

344
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
important activity

345
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
but it should never be the only one

346
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,399
the idea is to push left to start

347
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
security activities

348
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
even before the new code is written

349
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
how to push left include security in the

350
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,519
design phase using threat modeling

351
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,040
include security and code review and

352
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
testing try out virus automated tools to

353
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,480
help you

354
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
maybe run an internal bike roundly

355
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
if not the offensive trainings i've

356
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,959
attended i probably wouldn't be here

357
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,079
today with you

358
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,000
the training sparked my interest in 90

359
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,839
sec and i quit my job as a developer and

360
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,279
moved into security

361
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,399
my case is an exception though

362
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
and getting back to world war ii what

363
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
would you teach

364
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
a paratrooper well

365
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
to parachute of course and to fight

366
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,000
effectively being surrounded by the

367
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
enemy forces

368
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
to shoot as well is comet 101 not only

369
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
for a paratrooper

370
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
but you do not teach a paratrooper how

371
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
to drive a tank

372
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
you teach how to destroy a tank the same

373
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,320
idea should

374
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
be applied to developers trainings

375
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
in my opinion there are four most

376
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
important aspects of a good application

377
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
security training

378
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
for developers first should be developer

379
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,000
oriented meaning it should take into

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
account how developer works

381
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,519
which is mostly writing code in visual

382
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,120
studio or other ide

383
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
you should not focus on finding bugs

384
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,399
from http proxy but on finding and

385
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,079
fixing bugs from the source code

386
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
level second developers should be

387
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
engaged should actively take part in

388
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,480
exercises and discussions

389
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
should exchange their experience with

390
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
the group and the trainer and not just

391
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
sit there and listen often distracted by

392
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
the phone

393
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
laptop and work first training should

394
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
contain

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,839
tons of examples of security failures of

396
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,440
other companies lots of examples of

397
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
vulnerabilities with consequences

398
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,880
to make developers aware how things

399
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
might go wrong in crosstalk scripting is

400
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
not about this stupid pop-up

401
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
but actually the attacker can make

402
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
actions on user's behalf

403
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,760
and four flexible sometimes you cannot

404
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,279
take out the whole team for two day long

405
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,000
workshop

406
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
so find one which lasts one day or fight

407
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
one which lasts two hours for four

408
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
consecutive days

409
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,519
uh to train the team without disturbing

410
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
their their

411
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,160
day-to-day activities have you ever

412
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
considered such training

413
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,199
when each developer individually can

414
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,639
start stop it whenever

415
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,440
she or he wants it and finally how it

416
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
has to be

417
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
all has to be online for developers i

418
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
think it should be the same experience

419
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
like watching bundle slash on netflix

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
okay so now we know how the training

421
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
should look like now we should see which

422
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,279
training suits home

423
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,240
the aim is to give proper fire to proper

424
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,279
people

425
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,000
um offensive trainings make sense when

426
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
the skills acquired

427
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
are later on used in the organization i

428
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
did both offensive and defensive

429
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
training

430
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
offensive with security champions and

431
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,399
they actually had the time

432
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
to use those skills on their day-to-day

433
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,600
job

434
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,880
i wouldn't recommend training a whole

435
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
team this way though uh

436
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
team or teams i would send to a

437
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
defensive one and i would also recommend

438
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,519
buying access to secure coding platform

439
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,160
for them to practice and of course let's

440
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,360
not forget about

441
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
new hires the sooner their journey with

442
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
application security will start

443
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
the better a final lesson

444
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
compliance and security requirements

445
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,040
here from the picture done probably from

446
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
an airplane we can see several tanks

447
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
located near the rhine river

448
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
during the world war ii it's very hard

449
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,680
to see it from the picture itself

450
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,639
but looking closely at the tanks the all

451
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,920
tanks look like

452
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
the one on the right side inflatable

453
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
dummy tank designed to confuse enemy

454
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
with the location and sides of

455
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,480
your forces you cannot see it from a

456
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,600
reconnaissance plane

457
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
you must get closer and closer can be

458
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
too late

459
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
the disposition of the forces is bad

460
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
you're not where you should be

461
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
i remember one workshop when managers

462
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
said we do things this way following an

463
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,639
internal secure coding platform a policy

464
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
and then suddenly from the another side

465
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,959
of the table senior developers pop

466
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,360
no no no no we don't do things like this

467
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
there's no time

468
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
also multiple times i heard our app

469
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,240
secure

470
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
with audis we have best programmers on

471
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
the market we are compliant with this

472
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,800
and that

473
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,880
we have security requirements written

474
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
down and followed by our fabulous

475
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
developers

476
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,120
yeah yeah yeah for those of you working

477
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
with sas platforms imagine a situation

478
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
where some potential big customer knocks

479
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,320
to your door and says

480
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
we will buy you services but first

481
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,959
please kindly fill this

482
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,240
500 questions spreadsheet about your

483
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,199
appsec program

484
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
better be sure that the answers you give

485
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
are good because we'll check

486
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
i've seen this personally and it's hard

487
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,480
developers do not like filming

488
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
spreadsheets well i don't like doing the

489
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
lighter

490
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
but sometimes the security departments

491
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,959
in their infinite wisdom

492
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
give them guides to follow and

493
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
spreadsheets to fill

494
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
sometimes everything is fine only on

495
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,079
paper

496
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
sometimes even feeling the spreadsheet

497
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,279
is painful

498
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,440
and requirements or questions are not

499
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,680
designed for given application

500
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,880
a disc has to stop compliance

501
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
doesn't make an app secure at least not

502
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
the one on paper and not

503
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,440
the one at all cost if you want to make

504
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
those requirements really implemented

505
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,160
you have to work together

506
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
with developers with implementation and

507
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
verification of those requirements

508
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,720
next thing the list of requirements must

509
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
be written down in a language that

510
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
developers understand

511
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,959
and they should be engaged in creating

512
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
such lists as well

513
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,319
to give you an example of such document

514
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,839
i recommend reading was to obtain

515
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,959
proactive controls

516
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,119
and comparing it to the classic os 10

517
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,799
list to see the difference in a language

518
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,919
okay so let's jump to

519
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,839
guy based on those five lessons i've

520
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,879
told you about

521
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,840
most important action is to work on the

522
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,400
attitude you're in this together the

523
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
code the configuration or the

524
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,000
battlefield for application security's

525
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,679
calls

526
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
to summarize what you can do to make

527
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
applications more secure i've prepared a

528
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
short guide

529
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,919
first improve communication and make

530
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
direct connections with developers

531
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,799
learn how developers work alert them how

532
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
how you work

533
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,360
there's no silver bullet in security

534
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
explain again

535
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,600
what you can and you cannot do train

536
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
people properly

537
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
make them security aware show them

538
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,280
examples of bugs show consequences

539
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,720
engage them in creating verifying

540
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
requirements unsuccessively

541
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,039
in all actions related to application

542
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,960
security

543
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
secure software development life cycle

544
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
is an organizational change

545
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,160
so support from top management clear

546
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
areas of responsibility mutual

547
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,640
understanding

548
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,799
are crucial and let me emphasize it

549
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,679
again

550
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,799
people are most important part here to

551
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,280
paraphrase winston churchill

552
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
in the name of a rapsec cause we shall

553
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,640
fight

554
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
in the design phase we shall fight

555
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,919
through implementation we shall fight

556
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,760
during testing we shall fight

557
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,240
till the final release and we must fight

558
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
together

559
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
with developers to win the apsec battle

560
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
we shall never surrender

561
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
thank you for listening and catch me in

562
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
a live q a session
