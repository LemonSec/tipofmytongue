00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:04,640
hi

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,520
everybody my name is mohammed ashuri and

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,519
today i'm going to present

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
unveiling some untold facts regarding a

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
stuxnet

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
a decade after the attack

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
regarding myself i have a phd degree in

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,199
software security

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
and i am very interested in performing

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,800
program analysis

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
and security fuzzing additionally i have

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
scientific reports on designing

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
cryptographic algorithms blockchain

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,399
security testing and web privacy

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,800
regarding my work experience i worked as

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,480
a cyber security researcher

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,520
at cisco and as a teacher at the

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,079
university

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
of pakistan currently i live in berlin

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
and you can get more information about

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,160
me by checking out my personal web page

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
so please feel free to drop me an email

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,840
if you have any question

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
we plunge into the technical aspects of

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,199
a stuxnet

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,039
i would like to give you a brief

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
background about centrifuges and plcs

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,360
to be sure we are on the same page

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,439
essentially centric features are

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
machines by which uranium is enriched

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
in these devices there are cylinders

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
which has been at

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,720
very high speed and centrifugal force

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
basically separates heavier gas

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,759
particles

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,400
which gets sent to the outside from

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,280
lighter gas

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
particles so centrifuges

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
are controlled by programmable logic

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,320
computers

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,439
or we would call them plc's thus

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,560
if these plcs cause the centrifuge

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,079
motors to spin too quickly

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
it can cause unexpected damage to the

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
nuclear sites

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,840
in this regard stuxnet was designed

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,360
as a war to infect the plc's

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,000
associated to centrifuges and the

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,479
computer networks around them

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,119
s success itself actually was found in

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
multiple version

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
that being said there has been some sort

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
of mutation

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
and opted platform as the bomb was

55
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,040
propagating

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
in order to gain maximum access and

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
execute arbitrary code

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
at privilege levels on the target

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,959
systems

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
estrox net exploited a number of

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
zero-day vulnerabilities

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
as attack vector so

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
please note that it was firstly

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
uncovered in 2010

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
so it could eventually propagate into

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
nuclear facilities

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,599
success ended up infecting approximately

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,400
200

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,159
000 computers however exact number

70
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,360
are still unknown although saxons were

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,879
originally aimed at

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,239
iran's nuclear facilities it has been

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,120
mutated

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
and spread to other industrial and

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
energy producing facilities

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
in various countries across the world

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
one of the zero day explode that

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
frequently using stoxnet code

79
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,799
is called ms08-067

80
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,840
that famously used by multiple version

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,200
of the conflictual

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,879
war which is a manner that form a botnet

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,879
and exploit vulnerability in the smb or

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,959
server message block protocol in

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
microsoft windows servers

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,959
precisely success distributes

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,840
itself through shape folders by scanning

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,519
network shapes

89
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,840
and installs a file which is called

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,879
dropper

91
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,920
and schedules a task to be executed on

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
the next day

93
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,920
the result of comparison between two

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,640
exploit

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
implementation in both confident here

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,720
and stocks nets

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,920
shows us that the shell code

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,040
in the uh basically a stock sensor code

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,360
is

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,599
rather sophisticated and employs

101
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,120
advanced techniques

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,079
in order to circumvent the memory

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
protection mechanism in windows

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
one of these is return objects

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,840
return oriented programming or rop

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,840
so in addition to the smp exploit

107
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
s-x-ness

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,680
comprises an exploit for for a

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
previously unknown vulnerability in the

110
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
print spooler service in windows this

111
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,560
one energy

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
makes it possible for malicious gold to

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
be passed and executed

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,240
on a remote machine so essentially this

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
exploit works for

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
execution of manages code when the

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
windows print

118
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,280
spooler service cannot properly validate

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
printer

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
drivers and this

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,160
occurs during the installation of a

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
printer from remote server

123
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
so as a result two files namely

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
venistar or vin insta.exe

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,800
and sysnod event.mof

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,320
appear on the infected machines

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
these two files are presumed to be

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
printing documents in the system

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
directory of target

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
server windows server machine however

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
here is the the point here is that

132
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
a guess user has no privilege

133
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,919
that allows her to write inside of the

134
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
system directly but while the

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,680
exploitation of this vulnerability a

136
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
trade-off process

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,880
is pulled sv xz calls an

138
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,960
api function which is named

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,280
start.printer

140
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
with parameter specifying the following

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,280
information

142
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,520
about the document to be printed so you

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
can see the information and the code

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,240
blow

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
the second stage of the attack employs

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,840
the

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,240
system events uh dot mof5

148
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
so m of mofi is managed uh

149
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,880
object format file so this sort of files

150
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
are often used in windows often used to

151
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,240
create

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,199
all registered providers events and even

153
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,680
categories for

154
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,240
wmi and under certain

155
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
conditions this file runs vinstar.exe

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
i.e the dropper and it's exact it is

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
executed by the system

158
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
user which results in the infection of

159
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,800
the whole

160
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,039
target system with the system privilege

161
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,599
so in addition to the aforementioned

162
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,280
exploit and few more

163
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
aesthetics also used a couple of

164
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,360
interesting privilege

165
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
escalation based exploits that

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,759
work based on a few zero-day

167
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,199
vulnerabilities for instance it explodes

168
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
k keyboard layout files so when

169
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,880
windows would load the keyboard layout

170
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,000
it indeed

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
causes an array index out of bounds

172
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,479
exception

173
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
and because the keyboard the keyboard

174
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,479
layout when loaded by the kernel

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
this trick basically allows the form to

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,520
execute

177
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,400
arbitrary code inside of the ring 0 ie

178
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,599
the kernel level

179
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,800
right furthermore essex

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
success uh exploit a vulnerability in

181
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
windows test scheduler

182
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,720
so that then the windows test scheduler

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,520
with a store

184
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
task it would validate them upon

185
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,160
load with a crc3 to

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,479
checksum right so a structurenet could

187
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
execute arbitrary commands with system

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,919
privilege

189
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,639
uh by exploiting a vulnerability zero

190
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,759
divinity

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,120
in the test scheduler

192
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
note that

193
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,840
s success uh necessarily didn't

194
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
restricted replication just through the

195
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,960
network and share folders it

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,799
lead another attack to target windows

197
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,839
systems in this nuclear size but

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,120
usb flash drives as well so this is

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
especially important

200
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,599
because unlike typical computer forms

201
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,959
essentially target

202
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
machines that may not be connected to

203
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
internet or any network at all

204
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
because by the way this system belongs

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,480
to nuclear site right

206
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
therefore in order to infect this sort

207
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
of machines

208
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,920
a success has to find a value a strategy

209
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,279
to replicate itself through some sort of

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,320
physical attack

211
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
vector right to do this this wall

212
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,600
exploits the cve 2010

213
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,959
uh 2568 vulnerability

214
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,480
which impact the lnk or shortcut icon

215
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,760
vulnerability

216
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
in windows when we analyzed a

217
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
usb flash drive infected with the stocks

218
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
in our lab

219
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
we found six files there which you can

220
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
see them in the following screenshots

221
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
the first screenshot right so the first

222
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,959
four files

223
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
are lnk or link files these are

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
files that specify how the icon

225
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
of other files should be displayed

226
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,040
the files with lnk extensions are

227
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,160
different

228
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
here is an example of the contents of

229
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,839
one of them

230
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,800
in the screenshot down below so when a

231
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
user

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
tries to open an infected usb drive the

233
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,720
file with the name wtr

234
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,720
4141 point tmp

235
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
is loaded and its entry point is called

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
right the file indeed is a dynamic link

237
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,120
library dla which loads another file

238
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,880
with the name

239
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,720
wtr4132 point tmp

240
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,800
from the infected flash drive this file

241
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,680
indeed comprises a success actual

242
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,560
malicious code

243
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
so as you know the ultimate target of

244
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,320
this toxins

245
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680
is targeting

246
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,519
and stopping iranian nuclear facilities

247
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,560
or uranium enrichments facilities so

248
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
after gaining arbitrary code execution

249
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,160
access

250
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
on this infected system in this nuclear

251
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,279
site

252
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
through a number of already mentioned

253
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,480
exploits

254
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
stocks now tries to attack

255
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
the step 7 zeeman software

256
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,760
so why this software because this

257
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,959
software

258
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,920
is an industrial control program that

259
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,640
contains

260
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,800
project files and inside of it

261
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
success injects its manages dlls

262
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
and other files to the software right

263
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,600
therefore this process this whole

264
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
process of dln injection

265
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,839
allows uh stocks to insert its uh

266
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,360
commands to the into the one of the

267
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,720
memory blocks in the plc machines right

268
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
programmable logic controller machine

269
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
that is responsible for controlling

270
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
centrifuges motors right that result in

271
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
changing the centrifuges motor

272
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
frequencies

273
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
in order to break the nuclear enrichment

274
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
facilities down

275
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,320
so apart from that softness established

276
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
a botnet and installed its

277
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
encrypted configuration data which is

278
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,079
around 1860 bytes in a specific

279
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
encrypted file in wind directory

280
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,519
because as you know the target system

281
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
here are just windows system

282
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
so this encrypted data comprises various

283
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,079
information

284
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,560
so such as urls of cnc servers

285
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
activation time which is the time that

286
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,760
means basically

287
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,399
time and date after which the volume is

288
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
active

289
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,480
and the activation time which is the

290
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,959
time

291
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,399
after which the worm becomes inactive

292
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,920
and probably delete itself the version

293
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,959
of malware

294
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,839
and other information about the

295
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,279
propagation and functioning

296
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,279
as we can see them in the screenshot

297
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
here

298
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,600
so as a conclusion a suckness is the

299
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,240
first

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,880
plc root kit and it has received

301
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,839
worldwide

302
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,120
attention for causing physical damage

303
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,760
in an industrial infrastructure

304
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,680
seemingly isolated from the internet

305
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,279
i.e iranian nuclear

306
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,639
facilities although the ultimate target

307
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,560
of this cyber weapon

308
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,040
i mean uh starkness was the iranian

309
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,639
nuclear facilities

310
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
it couldn't actually stop uranium

311
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,680
enrichment

312
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,760
in iran and the virus

313
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
actually is spread outside of iran at

314
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
and it's basically infected machines in

315
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,600
the united states russia

316
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
and india among many other countries so

317
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
it brings up the question was that

318
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
worthwhile

319
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
compromising an entire globe computer

320
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
security

321
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
only to stop at specific iranian

322
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,800
facilities

323
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
so here was my presentation thank you

324
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
very much for your attention and i hope

325
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,880
you enjoy

326
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
enjoy that please feel free to ask your

327
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
question

328
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
or drop me an email

329
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,839
thank you

330
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,720
you
