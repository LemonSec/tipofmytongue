1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,160
hello

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
my name is talia liao i am russian

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
israeli but i guess you might already

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,359
have figured out from my

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
accent uh prior to my current position i

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
was a full-time pen tester

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
and a cnac red team member today i'm

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,279
working as a principal consultant

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
in singapore providing advisory on cyber

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
security aspects of emerging technology

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
and supporting our bank strategic

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,000
projects

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
some of the projects that i am working

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
currently

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
are digital small screens for retimers

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,399
which already have been submitted to

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:44,960
meter

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
and now i'm working on another study how

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,719
hackers impacting the financial markets

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
which is pretty fun so far and yeah i

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,840
enjoy cooking doing research and

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,320
writing so begumbego is my mentor

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,800
she has recently graduated and has a

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,438
great interest in cyber security

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,759
but she could not attend today's talk

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,159
so please let me read the disclaimer now

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,240
to let us get started

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
the views and opinions expressed in this

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
presentations are solely our own

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
and do not express the views or opinions

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,400
of our employers

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
so you're probably asking yourself if

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
this is just another talk on atos

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
but in this talk i want to take you

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
through the end to end

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
ecosystem of automated account takeovers

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
while treating the cyber crime as a

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,000
fully

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
functioning profit driven business

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,119
industry

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
considering the status quo that enables

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
the automated atos

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
i also want to discuss my take on the

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,759
reasons behind the rise

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
in account takeovers and the account

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,880
frauds and this is regardless

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,719
of the great progress that has been

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,159
happening recently

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
in overall cyber secureness whether it's

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,399
in private or

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,199
public campaigns and finally i will

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,840
share my recommendations and suggestions

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
to users and companies as someone that

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
comes from a corporate background

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
and not as a vendor therefore i believe

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
my opinions will be

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,680
unbiased

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
during this study we researched more

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,319
than 30 techniques of atos to understand

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
the overall ato threat landscape

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
but we decided to take a deeper look on

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,319
one specific

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,879
ato an ato that seems to be getting a

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
lot of attention and seeing continuous

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,599
growth

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
as one of the easiest attacks to

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,959
automate

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,239
this attacks offers high gains even for

69
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,480
low grade criminals with an access to a

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,280
few easy to operate tools

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
and a massive auto massive innovation

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,599
industry that works behind the scenes

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,840
an industry that continuously supports

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
and develops

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
new counter measures to minimize

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
automated account takeovers

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
costs meaning

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,959
no anyone with a passion or a need for

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,760
extra cash

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,879
just could hop on and start achieving as

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
you might already have guessed

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
the most obvious attack method in this

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
list which is also

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,959
easy to automate in mass scale is

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,560
credential stuffing

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
we just took this method as an example

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
to explore the world of automated

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
account takeovers

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
could also point you to some of the most

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
interesting atos methods that i have

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,879
studied

92
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,760
and practiced before like the sdk based

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
atos and cognitive hacks

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,920
that lead to ato it is good also to

95
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,040
point out that the improper

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,560
authentication vulnerability

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,360
is getting a lot of attention in hacker

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,760
one

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
bank bounty's uh programs as an attack

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
that could obviously lead to

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
atos if you would like to drill down to

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
any of the mentioned ato attacks please

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
free to ask me

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,519
during the q a or send me your questions

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
on linkedin email or twitter i'll be

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,399
available for this

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
so let's start by covering the overview

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
of climate fostering the atos

109
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
let us take a close closer look and

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
understand the type of relationship

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
between criminals companies and their

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
users as a factor

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
to ato growth particularly to automated

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,240
ideos

115
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
in one hand the level of cyber criminal

116
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
sophistication is lowered within access

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,919
to easy to operate tools

118
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
continuous data links from companies

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,240
that are collecting our kyc data

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,960
or links of credentials that are being

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
published in the market within

122
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,840
a few minutes from the bridge today in

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,639
the world of

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
e2e platforms like telegram and other

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,040
platforms cyber cameras are no longer

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
even required to have the knowledge of

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
how to access dr

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
darknet marketplaces or maintain their

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,919
anonymity

130
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
on other hand companies negotiating

131
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,800
today and buying back their

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
back their bridge data of the customers

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,479
from the from cyber criminals paying off

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
ransom or hiring external companies to

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,520
help

136
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
help them do that this is obviously

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,199
going against the official

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,240
recommendation

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,199
such as those from fbi companies

140
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,120
adopting hypes like passwordless and

141
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
promoting

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,520
immature authentication models like

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
those in

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,360
biometrics with a current sega of 90

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
growth in this industry which is amazing

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
i express my worries about biometrics

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
and success

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,960
in access channels in the paper so i'm

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,000
not planning to

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,639
go through them uh here

151
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,720
i also don't not gonna go through why

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
customers still prefer using passwords

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
so this is was mentioned

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
in our paper and i really are referring

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
to that

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
we can also find today companies that

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,160
specialize for uh

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
from such criminals activities

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
indirectly

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
so some some activities that being

161
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
capitalized by companies

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
happens by adopting uh

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
sharing credentials as a strategy to

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
raise brand awareness

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
and having a bigger bite of their

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,080
markets

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,880
a good example such companies are the

168
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
subscription-based companies

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
like the movie streaming subscriptions

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,080
that we know

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
all about but i will just avoid

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
mentioning the names because i'm pretty

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,800
sure you can guess this room

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
companies that are putting in place in

175
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
uh not adequate counter measures

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,759
to prevent automatic mass bailouts

177
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,639
buyouts

178
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,960
in retail platforms to increase the

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
brand

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,120
hype culture good example for this

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
case is the known sneakers brands that

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
tend to sell out

183
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,199
in moments of right after they've been

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,960
in a shell

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
and companies like social media giants

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
with a big budget but still struggling

187
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
to self-regulate themselves

188
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
to detect fake accounts and malicious

189
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,280
account activity in their platforms the

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,880
last point that i want to mention

191
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
is the growing business models which are

192
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
leveraging user data

193
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
so seeing a decrease in our data being

194
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
found is not

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
so realistic especially when a number of

196
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,039
data breaches are

197
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,199
as well as the average of cost of data

198
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,479
breach is growing

199
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,199
based on the identity theft resource

200
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,080
center

201
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,080
report i want to share with you

202
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
an interesting experiment conducted by

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
nato not to try to shed some

204
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,120
more light on the self-regulation

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
challenges that our tech

206
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,400
giants dealing with in this experiment

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,680
natto team bought engagement of 100

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,759
different posts on facebook instagram

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,400
twitter

210
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,680
and youtube using 11

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
russian and 5 european social media

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,479
manipulation service providers

213
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,160
they spent 300 euros on 3 000 comments

214
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,440
25 000 likes 20 000 views

215
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,960
and 5 000 followers nato team were

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,800
able to identify almost 90 000 accounts

217
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
which were being used for social media

218
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
manipulation

219
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
one one good

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
one good example that you might heard of

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,000
was

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
last year from facebook that was that

223
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
reported

224
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,640
that they removed 2.2 billion

225
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
fake accounts from their platform to sum

226
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
up self-regulation by

227
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
this giants doesn't seem to work or

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
there is a lack in having a significant

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
commitment to handle this issue

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
so one maybe one question that is

231
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
raising is at least for me if we are

232
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,320
enabling cyber criminals to develop

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,640
automation tools to manage so many fake

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
accounts without

235
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,640
much pushback should we expect such

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,320
companies to lead

237
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,360
the expected change my answer for this

238
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,800
question is absolutely no

239
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
absolutely no we should be very honest

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,320
with

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
ourselves providing such catalyst to

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,600
cyber criminals

243
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,920
that enables the continuous development

244
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
in such

245
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
attack method but not only that actually

246
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,440
such a number goes far beyond accounts

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
account takeovers

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,680
that don't have a big

249
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
enablement that goes up beyond the

250
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,399
accounts that don't have big up on the

251
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,200
financial

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,640
impact on us such an evidence creates

253
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,440
creating a an ecosystem where cyber

254
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
criminals developing

255
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,160
new bypass to ato

256
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
anti-fraud controls and other security

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
controls that they keep being developed

258
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
to be bypassed as we have noticed in our

259
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,560
study

260
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
and far beyond to

261
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
illustrate a similar poc but in a much

262
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
smaller

263
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,399
scope i put my personal instagram

264
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
to test i bought a gig from fiverr

265
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
that promised me a thousand brand new

266
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
followers to like my post whenever i

267
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
post them even if it's something silly

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
like a photo

269
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
of my fan and so

270
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
as you see my new fake friends keep

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
supporting me by liking and

272
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,399
commenting on my post within seconds of

273
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,519
my post

274
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,240
i cannot lie this is nice to have such

275
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,399
close friends that can appreciate

276
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
precious moments of my life

277
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
now that we cover the companies of the

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
the and cyber criminals aspects of this

279
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
relationship

280
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,240
let's close this loop with the with our

281
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,720
future

282
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
users and create clients

283
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
for this purpose i want to share with

284
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,880
you this data claims from my data report

285
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,079
report this report can show us how

286
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,279
our future clients base is increased as

287
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
the digital adoption keeps growing

288
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,079
looking at this figures from this report

289
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,959
and other

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,720
related reports like the one from

291
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,480
edelman we noticed that

292
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
the growing population is more connected

293
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,600
to the internet

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
and the number of accounts per user is

295
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
growing

296
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
we also noticed an important figure

297
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
showing that people trust

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
on how their data is being handled by

299
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,640
the tech companies

300
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,320
is diminishing i think we all can agree

301
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
when we say that leaving an era of

302
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
having an online presence comes with a

303
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
direct cost of having

304
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,519
a great chance of being pumped

305
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
so here we also want to share with you

306
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
some of the ato costs and figures that

307
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
we managed to collect from the

308
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
muscle really resources we could find

309
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,639
and yes

310
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,399
it was not an easy challenge

311
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
so looking at the first one account

312
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,720
fraud the last figures reported

313
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
by german strategy research in their

314
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,480
20-20 year report

315
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
was that 6.8 billion in losses

316
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,399
just in the us

317
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,519
and this is obviously a huge maybe not

318
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
huge but very sharp growth

319
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
from the last year report which reported

320
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,519
four billion dollars in losses

321
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,160
uh when looking at the operational costs

322
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
we have

323
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,320
helpdesk costs with an average of

324
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
15 per ticket and two dollars on average

325
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,279
per minute talking to help desk

326
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,920
such cause quickly become massive when

327
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
looking at some of the latest credential

328
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,880
staffing attacks

329
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,880
like the one that happened in disney

330
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
just on the side note myself and begum

331
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,639
submitted the disney case

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,959
with the full analysis to cloud security

333
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,399
and alliance

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,519
this analysis should be published

335
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
in the ingredients cloud community

336
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,279
computing top threats report that should

337
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
be published soon

338
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,760
so regarding some some of the trust

339
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
costs we observe figures that stating

340
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
that if there is a breach 81 of the

341
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,880
people would not

342
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
would stop engaging with the brand

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
online but there are only

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,399
uh but there are many other different uh

345
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
cost parameters that should be

346
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,279
considered here so this parameter is

347
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
very problematic

348
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,519
but still we can see a high growth in a

349
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,720
in acquisition

350
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,839
of the user costs so definitely

351
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,399
there is not only a trust issue here but

352
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,440
also

353
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,920
an increase in acquisitions and on the

354
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
future acquisition costs

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,399
i remind you my contact is published so

356
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,639
please free to contact me and ask me

357
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,519
more questions on any of this course we

358
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,079
can go

359
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,639
really drill down to any of them one by

360
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,880
one

361
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,000
uh the next step the role we will cover

362
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
the role of credential staffing and

363
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
automated ato accounts

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
so this is a life cycle of automated

365
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,480
aetos

366
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
with a closer look from a credential

367
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
staffing perspective as this is a

368
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,560
classic

369
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,839
example for an automated ato a big

370
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
portion of this lifecycle applies very

371
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
much to any type of

372
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
ato and not just automated as you might

373
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
already noticed

374
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
first let's start by covering some of

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,519
the report

376
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,839
some of the reported stats to get

377
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,199
quicker idea

378
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,719
on where we are at today

379
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,079
there are 50 000 unique ip addresses

380
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
making credential sufficient attempts on

381
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,680
their daily basis

382
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,639
60 people answered in a large survey

383
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,519
that they have

384
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,760
that they're using one or more passwords

385
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,959
across multiple accounts

386
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,279
users reuse the same password usually

387
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,680
four to six times

388
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,399
users have 90 counts on average each

389
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,880
so now let's go through the steps of the

390
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
life cycle and later we can cover them

391
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
more in that

392
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,160
so the first step is acquiring access

393
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,399
so in this first phase where the

394
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,800
criminal war acquire compromised account

395
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
log

396
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,360
with an usually using anonymous

397
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,959
wallets those wallets that usually don't

398
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,600
require to have the kyc processor

399
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
go to be followed or the

400
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
those credentials could be the account

401
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
log could be purchased using

402
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
obviously the compromise the credit

403
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,399
cards that could be found for few

404
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,800
dollars

405
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
resources for this are on in the in the

406
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,839
white paper

407
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
so if you guys interested please go

408
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,759
ahead

409
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,959
so the next step will be the preparation

410
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
phase in the subsequent phase that

411
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
basically we uh

412
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,959
we the the the preparations so what's

413
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
happening in the preparation this is

414
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,199
where the

415
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,240
cyber criminal will start figuring if

416
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
you're configuring their tools for the

417
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
attack

418
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,600
uh an attack in the next step as a

419
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
attacker obviously is

420
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,279
the cyber thing was performing an attack

421
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,199
and creating his presence

422
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,320
persistence over the attack in the

423
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
reconnaissance

424
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
we are preparing reality pre-tax if and

425
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,440
when

426
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,040
it will be required for the strike

427
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
basically the cashing in phase example

428
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,279
for this

429
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,759
get it get as much information as

430
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
possible with the authent

431
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
sock me which is basically i mean social

432
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
intelligence gathering and dslrs

433
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,600
so dsrs maybe it's a new term that's uh

434
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,480
that is

435
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
out there data access right exploits

436
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,959
the ability to request access to all

437
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,720
personal information a company

438
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
has on the individual best to listen to

439
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:53,920
amber

440
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,959
amber well on this topic

441
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
on creating and on creating a pretext

442
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
at all dennis will be a great person to

443
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,199
check on

444
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
those two persons like really good and i

445
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
learned from them a lot

446
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,319
the next step will be cashing in uh

447
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
following this

448
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
step basically is the cyber criminals

449
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,919
finished their research

450
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,039
on the victim uh they know basically

451
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
everything that they could about

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,199
from the victim itself and now they will

453
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,959
start taking actions

454
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
taking actions basically to monetize

455
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
how they are going to monetize the eto

456
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
an example will be to set a request for

457
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,600
a loan

458
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
or request to increase the the credit

459
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,720
limit or

460
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,799
issue new credit new credit cards

461
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
the next step is a cashing out step

462
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
phase lastly in this step where the

463
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
cyber criminal is focused on moving

464
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
everything that

465
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,160
they got from the cashing in process

466
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
to their own accounts

467
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,200
so just like just like let's go through

468
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
the acquiring uh

469
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
credentials i think is many people

470
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
already familiar with this

471
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,880
uh so let's just cover it so acquiring

472
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,240
access is the first step in the

473
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
lifecycle of automated etos

474
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
so in this step where the cyber criminal

475
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,039
are actually

476
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
cyber criminals are actually going after

477
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
the credentials to get the naq

478
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
usually those credentials can be found

479
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,799
in the reputable

480
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,559
and well-known account shops um

481
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,280
high with the high rank uh sellers

482
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,559
obviously that will have their own

483
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,919
reviews comments

484
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,880
how good they are and i will obviously

485
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
publish those across different forms

486
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
to make sure that everyone knows who is

487
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
the most

488
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,120
uh trustworthy resource for together uh

489
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
credentials uh it's but it's not only

490
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,679
credentials also we may well mention the

491
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,840
later so if the prices go usually for me

492
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,200
five dollars to 250 obviously we can

493
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
find

494
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
much slower prices but this is the

495
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,919
prices that you

496
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
will see from the uh

497
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
from the people that actually have good

498
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,959
comments and good reviews

499
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
when the cyber criminal is buying an

500
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,240
account log from

501
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,760
such shop is the cyber criminals usually

502
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,039
getting a few

503
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
things packaged like having their

504
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
account log and the seller

505
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
will be validated by the account shop

506
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,080
administrators the second point is that

507
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,360
the cyber criminals

508
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,240
could get a digital mask as part of the

509
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,799
account

510
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,240
log package and last thing the

511
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,559
the criminal will get is the experience

512
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,919
of customer service

513
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,000
which means having a guarantee of a

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
fully working functioning account log

515
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,400
just going back to the digital mask

516
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
digital mask or

517
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,320
they have so many names the open gangers

518
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,960
and

519
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
so many different names that you will be

520
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
you'll find online

521
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
those usually used to bypass fraud

522
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,039
detections and

523
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,400
other verification mechanisms containing

524
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,799
usually victims unique baby behaviors

525
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,440
like tap touch account frequency

526
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,760
browsing the patterns like screen time

527
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,880
or field user inter interests

528
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
victims device fingerprints like device

529
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,559
id or

530
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,799
os version uh

531
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,880
interesting enough just to mention where

532
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,720
if you if you're asking where they are

533
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
coming from

534
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
and some of the research that being

535
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,960
through the list is

536
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
basically that identified that

537
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,799
this digital mass or double gangers

538
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,640
are found through delivered by

539
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,679
the the operators of uh

540
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,280
info steering malware like other

541
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,159
road so a bunch of those kind of a

542
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,400
malware

543
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
operators are providing this uh kind of

544
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,320
thing to these shops

545
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
in a mass so there is somebody worried

546
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,799
about how this kind of shops will

547
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
will operate and uh and looking at their

548
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,640
supply chain

549
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
and getting a bit worried if such a

550
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,039
phenomenon can continue

551
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
uh the other option to get the account

552
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
credentials say logs

553
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
it's mostly account credentials it's

554
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
basic to purchase or

555
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
find online find them basically online

556
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:32,799
for free

557
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,400
or have them where the most updated list

558
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
that could be found out there those the

559
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
more the updated lists usually are

560
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
filtered

561
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
from the accounts that uh most likely

562
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
are not valid

563
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
after they've been checked with a

564
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,880
whether you

565
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,000
username if the username is valid or not

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
uh some of them will be filtered by

567
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
removing all the famous

568
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
passwords that being reused so many

569
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
times

570
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,559
and all the by obviously remove the

571
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,679
duplicates

572
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,720
so all this uh famous

573
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
collection kind of a combo list are

574
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,039
being through this process

575
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,120
so usually you can find them all for

576
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,640
free but

577
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,760
you can find them also for a small fee

578
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,120
and of course we have the very new

579
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
interesting services like combo as a

580
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
service

581
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,600
that are available today in the

582
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
different to be purchased on different

583
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,678
forms

584
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,799
so when we're going to the attack phase

585
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,760
of basically validating the accounts we

586
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,840
have five

587
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,559
tools aka bots which you will quickly

588
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,080
able to identify

589
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,039
which were better than the other one so

590
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,120
let's start with the most basic one the

591
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,520
quick

592
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,440
checkers like the office 36365 email

593
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
checkers

594
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
which is used as a first filter checked

595
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,039
with the victims accounts

596
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,159
is really working by verify by basically

597
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
verifying if the email is valid

598
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,760
which is in many cases uses a username

599
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,880
so usually such tools will also come

600
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
with a function to merge

601
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,159
organize for easier use but you will see

602
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,840
them in most of the

603
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
in most of the tools those kind of basic

604
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,679
uh

605
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
additional functions for this kind of uh

606
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,600
easy to use tools

607
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
as a first stage so the next type of

608
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
tools are the dedicated tools

609
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,960
like uh the netflix checker those

610
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,039
this kind of tools have been configured

611
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,480
with a specific target

612
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,039
with a limited options option in their

613
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,440
settings like changing the type of proxy

614
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,320
loading the combo list and like the

615
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,600
famous collection

616
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,640
two through five uh

617
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,559
those obviously will have their own

618
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
headers being configured

619
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,080
and this is like how they get the latest

620
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,279
versions

621
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,840
for every one of those tools

622
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
there are also legitimate tools like

623
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,880
open bullet that they originally were

624
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,440
developed for developers qa and ethical

625
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,080
hackers

626
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
but cyber criminals defer them to their

627
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,320
own malicious ends

628
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,559
obviously not uh something that we are

629
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,919
super

630
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
surprised by because this is not a new

631
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,360
fact that cyber criminals you're

632
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,720
using legitimate tools to

633
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
to gain access or to do anything

634
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,840
and so this is like very not new

635
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,840
especially on the windows exploits and

636
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,440
binaries

637
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
so this is just going one step further

638
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,559
and we have the ios

639
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,919
all in one tools like sniper

640
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,679
and those that come reloaded with

641
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,279
official configs

642
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,320
and with a with an option to configure

643
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,039
your own

644
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,440
and then upload them in many cases

645
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
subreddit cyber criminals have a

646
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,520
specific target that they usually

647
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,640
have in their mind that

648
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,279
probably are not in the official configs

649
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,080
this will

650
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,120
require many of these beginners to start

651
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,480
their search for custom

652
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,000
configs on on different forms

653
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
like the discord channels telegram

654
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,679
groups

655
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
and the obvious one which

656
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
seems like uh that was happening in most

657
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,400
cases

658
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,000
is basically just hire a freelancer

659
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,120
uh in the bunch of freelancer shops uh

660
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,320
from what i saw there are several

661
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
freelancing platforms that are very much

662
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,520
uh hinting that they can do what the

663
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
cyberking is looking for those

664
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,960
freelancers could be found for 10 to 15

665
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,039
dollars i'm talking only about the good

666
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,240
ones

667
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,840
with a high ranking on those freelancing

668
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,440
websites obviously we could find online

669
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
for two and three dollars but if you

670
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
want to get your job done

671
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,919
usually though this kind of this is the

672
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,159
range of prices

673
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
and the last and most sophisticated type

674
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,360
of tool is not

675
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,159
really a tool but an option to script

676
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,760
your own tool option

677
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,039
basically using a phantom gas triple gs

678
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,520
using emulation libraries like puppeteer

679
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,679
and selenium

680
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,000
the last two options usually go together

681
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
with the use of digital mask if there is

682
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,960
such

683
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
in case an attack is targeted on a

684
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,720
specific victim

685
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
this is generally means the criminal

686
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,880
will use the remote server with rdp

687
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,799
which could be found basically for two

688
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,000
three dollars

689
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
vps or their own configured sandbox

690
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,960
uh that goes through residential proxy

691
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,919
which amazingly enough could be found

692
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,840
within few miles of the victim's

693
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,720
house um cyber criminals looking forward

694
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
for the next generation bad boss version

695
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,360
which is not so far away uh

696
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,279
those are basically the the next

697
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
generation basically ai

698
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,600
and has systems to ever the that

699
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,799
evaluate the

700
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
bad boss to the beyond level two of

701
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,840
automation

702
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,120
so to get a better idea of uh

703
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,240
what is level two three and four just to

704
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,720
get get through this uh where are we

705
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
from the automation

706
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,960
uh site i guess you will see this in

707
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
many other industries but you know

708
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,399
we see this in automated uh bad bots as

709
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,520
well

710
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,440
and uh for this uh i will refer to you

711
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
to go to

712
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
to check christopher wallace great

713
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,679
presentations on this

714
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,240
he's explaining this and uh much

715
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
verbosity and

716
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,679
really great to hear his opinions about

717
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,080
this as well

718
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,520
so in cashing in phase i i will cover

719
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,679
what makes criminals busy

720
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,159
once they secure their access to the

721
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,120
account

722
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,880
a good start to share right from the

723
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,320
start is that most of the etos last

724
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,760
less than 24 hours in many cases

725
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,559
we are taking we talking about only few

726
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,039
minutes

727
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,559
and sometimes a few hours so this might

728
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,919
be sound like a

729
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,640
long process but it's a very short one

730
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,840
uh for those that

731
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,200
for most of the cases so

732
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,320
let's go one by one and understand them

733
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,559
an example where collaborators have an

734
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,520
ato

735
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,158
or offer bank account for this example

736
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,360
so this is where the cyber criminal

737
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,440
criminals will apply for a home

738
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,640
car personal loans or even apply for

739
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,919
mortgages

740
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,240
the next one is where the criminals will

741
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,919
have tried to perform different

742
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,440
export data access exploits

743
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
basically get all the information that

744
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
the company is storing on the client

745
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,440
this information will use will be used

746
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,399
for the second

747
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,760
and the third tier attacks a good

748
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,679
example will be

749
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,760
where this information will be sold to

750
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,240
the support

751
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,279
support teams where they will be

752
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,840
basically say calling those people and

753
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,960
trying to say

754
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,240
hey we we know everything about you

755
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,039
and you your account was stuck and let

756
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,880
me just reset your account

757
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
or any of those type of scams that has

758
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
happened that is happening

759
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,440
i have great examples in the white paper

760
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,600
and i received this quite a lot so it's

761
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,760
really amazing to see how even those

762
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,919
kind of tier 2 attacks

763
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,039
are being progressed the tier 3 most

764
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
likely will be those that

765
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,399
creating accounts new accounts based on

766
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:56,960
this

767
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,559
information and basically most of this

768
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,080
to pass the kyc process

769
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
so criminals will also try to request

770
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,559
and later exploit credit limit

771
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,520
extensions

772
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
credited limited extension is also used

773
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,279
for loans but also used

774
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,520
for getting a credit for your account

775
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,960
so the next one will be criminals so

776
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,039
will request to issue credit cards or

777
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,440
debit cards and ask them have it sent

778
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,559
to their mail drop mail drops today

779
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,679
is very not hard thing to do this

780
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,080
this is in most cases you can find us in

781
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,960
uh

782
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
for a public service public services

783
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
provide mail drops

784
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,760
i know it's unusual but many people are

785
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,279
using this kind of services

786
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,559
for to have their merchandise sent to a

787
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,440
country that

788
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
the originated country is not sending

789
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,360
the merchandise too

790
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,000
so it's just a mail drop very not

791
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,840
unusual service and

792
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
cyber criminals are really leveraging

793
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,440
this

794
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
so the last one the criminal is not

795
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
really a last one but one of the

796
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
interesting ones the cyber kingdoms

797
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,200
could be paid to serve the money mules

798
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
independently or even export their

799
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,240
services

800
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,360
to be managed by the money mule herders

801
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,679
some other activities can include apply

802
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,919
and enable services like payla

803
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,480
those are the p2p payments convert money

804
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
to rewards

805
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,640
etc

806
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,840
so let's cover the ato pricing and

807
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,159
selling

808
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,200
at your pricing pricing of any ato is

809
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,760
not an

810
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,840
easy job for individual criminals who

811
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,279
needs to do

812
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,200
the pricing of the ato based on the

813
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,360
different account factors as shown in

814
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,039
the slide

815
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,200
some of the examples as you guys see

816
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,799
already victims

817
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,880
financial history basically looking at

818
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,159
them account

819
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,200
aging factor uh account balance

820
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,159
obviously confirm future payments credit

821
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:58,720
score

822
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
social score social score is based on

823
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,240
reconciles that

824
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,519
uh from the stage that was done uh

825
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,480
digital mask as we mentioned and the

826
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,440
last one that

827
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,159
i want to mention is the h segmentation

828
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:12,880
and ato

829
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,080
ch cause changes as there is

830
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,279
also substantial behavior change uh

831
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,240
in their age patterns behaviors

832
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
behaviors like we can't see

833
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
very honestly like from for millennials

834
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
and seniors

835
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,960
very different behaviors and there is

836
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
even a term for that

837
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,960
age associated financial vulnerability

838
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,360
or

839
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,679
af a a fb

840
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,919
pricing becomes even more charging when

841
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,840
it comes to a mass ato's

842
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,919
which is being which being controlled

843
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,960
and managed by

844
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,039
organized threat groups these groups

845
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,760
will usually have their own facilitators

846
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,679
like accountants and other service

847
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,880
providers

848
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,600
to talk more on the how the thread

849
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,399
account

850
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,960
and how the thread groups are pricing

851
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,600
the

852
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,120
and what is the ranges here you are you

853
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,360
please

854
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,840
connect contact me directly or we can do

855
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,799
this on a

856
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,720
questions and answer this phase

857
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,279
so once the once the pricing is

858
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,720
is done there is a this is where the

859
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,000
cash

860
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
was the the pricing is done and uh and

861
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,840
uh

862
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
this is where we are looking at the

863
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,039
selling platforms and the facilitators

864
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,600
so basically criminals can when they

865
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,880
want to sell

866
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,559
the logs they can use several uh options

867
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,960
and let's just mention some few of the

868
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
obvious ones maybe

869
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,960
so middleman services services that

870
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
could be found in forms

871
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,600
even if offered by the forms

872
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,559
administrators themselves

873
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,559
with the promise that they won't run an

874
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,760
escrow exit

875
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
uh scam on you in many cases such

876
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,080
services using

877
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,320
instant server instant vault services

878
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,120
basically

879
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,960
when i pay i get a a an email and link

880
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,280
to

881
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,320
the instant vault once i get once i pay

882
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,839
the vault is opening i can get my uh

883
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,679
whatever i purchase as a client

884
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,918
so this kind of services obviously uh

885
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,159
provide some quality assurance and money

886
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,760
transfer assurance

887
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,320
that those the two parties the buy and

888
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,960
the seller

889
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,520
are not always can find the right way to

890
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,839
agree on

891
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
such middle servers are not only

892
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
providers for credentials demand

893
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,079
services

894
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,639
but only also providing subscription

895
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,679
services

896
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,320
so basically putting many of those

897
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,679
administrators of

898
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,639
forms providing this kind of services

899
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,199
which is

900
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,719
uh also very good for buyers and sellers

901
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,560
the sellers of course getting a very

902
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,160
good price

903
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,640
and quick to market and just getting

904
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,520
their

905
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
money very quick more one more

906
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,960
option is the obvious one sell the log

907
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,240
on account shops

908
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,359
marketplaces with the sellers and with

909
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,800
the seller commissions for

910
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,119
five to fifteen dollar percent

911
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,280
the other option is to sell

912
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,359
independently in a digital intangible

913
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,320
storefronts

914
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,359
for example shopee sally dear io these

915
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,359
services are offered for a smaller

916
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,720
monthly fee

917
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,920
this type of stores can even be embedded

918
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,359
directly within web forms and even the

919
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,320
amps

920
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,920
this this is an amazing progress uh

921
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,040
putting a storefront in the posting

922
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,640
themselves

923
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,599
which i found like as amazing progress

924
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,280
for what i knew

925
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,520
the last option is obviously is to use

926
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,400
the p2p

927
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,400
platforms like telegram groups and

928
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,720
channels

929
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
in the cashing out phase criminals are

930
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,200
focusing on the what they could do

931
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,040
uh after what was already done

932
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
on the cashing in phase besides the

933
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,079
obvious

934
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,880
action of reselling the accounts so as

935
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
we mentioned before

936
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,520
what the criminals can do to leverage on

937
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,240
the whatever

938
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,119
the account has to get this to their own

939
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,520
accounts

940
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,200
to so to securely transfer funds uh or

941
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,680
any

942
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,000
value from the victim's account

943
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
criminals need to

944
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,079
be equipped with and they are equipped

945
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,720
with the

946
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,200
understanding of original and

947
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,280
international legal regulatory

948
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,640
and operational measures and aml

949
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
restrictions like the ones that been

950
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,240
adopted due to the patriot act

951
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,800
with a notable example that requires

952
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
trades and businesses to report cash

953
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,839
transactions of more than ten thousand

954
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,720
dollars

955
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,040
cyber criminals also understand if if

956
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,119
they will try to outsmart this drug

957
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,160
station they could be

958
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,280
issued with a suspicious activity report

959
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,119
which is basically sar

960
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,280
as we might heard this uh recently from

961
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
few banks

962
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,839
all these different types of

963
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,160
restrictions will be usually be bypassed

964
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
with alternative methods to move the

965
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,640
money such as smurfing method

966
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
which is basically means breaking the

967
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
down the cash into a smaller chunks

968
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
and depositing them to a different

969
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,079
accounts

970
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,000
some other ways are point transfer

971
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,119
as we might all know sending gift cards

972
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,000
uh using p2p payments to send money to

973
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,839
criminal accounts using services like

974
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,720
pay now

975
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,119
here in singapore and i'm sure you guys

976
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,200
have it in the any other country

977
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,400
or not uh account ransomware this is

978
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,240
some of the interesting one maybe

979
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
interesting option

980
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,480
is basically taking the uh taking the

981
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,280
account

982
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,000
as a ransom after changing the maybe the

983
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,560
authentications and the email

984
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,200
uh so this is like where the user will

985
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,160
take

986
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,680
the project cyber camera will take the

987
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,280
account as a ransom

988
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,400
and call the the call or message or

989
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,680
whatever the

990
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,280
the victim and try to get some of the

991
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
money

992
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,680
the this this is very similar to the

993
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,440
other attacks

994
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,640
that we see from the extortions

995
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,280
same patterns the same basically some

996
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,800
very similar patterns

997
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,119
that are they're coming up with on this

998
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,880
attack

999
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,280
so now let's finish up with the lessons

1000
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,240
and learnings

1001
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,280
so we noticed that uh that companies

1002
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,280
not only lo token wholly

1003
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,400
yeah so let's just cover some of the

1004
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,440
learnings

1005
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,599
uh avoid the adoption of weak attitudes

1006
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,520
and mentalities like assume bridge

1007
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,720
and not if but when

1008
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,640
uh use one or more lookup service

1009
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,280
some of the services like uh will be can

1010
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,000
be used with

1011
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,240
apis that could be found in uh

1012
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,800
have i been found yet or any other

1013
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,640
servers that provide this kind of

1014
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,480
services uh

1015
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,680
the the second one is the third one is

1016
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,160
adapt

1017
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,440
unified standard for multi-channel

1018
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,240
account

1019
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
access this is where basically we need

1020
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
to make sure that the account

1021
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,040
access across the platforms are

1022
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,240
are unified we may we found several

1023
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,000
companies that using even

1024
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,119
different password uh policies for

1025
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,000
their channels uh then they obviously

1026
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,880
there is uh

1027
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,760
the the the ato that we spoke about in

1028
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,240
the

1029
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,440
white paper which is cross ato is

1030
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,480
where one account uh when one account

1031
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,280
compromise

1032
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,079
uh of the way to compromise the account

1033
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,520
is being leveraged to

1034
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,040
uh to the other account credentials

1035
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,760
like the one of one of them will be if i

1036
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
have an access to facebook i can access

1037
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,040
the account

1038
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,119
uh even though i don't have the

1039
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,640
credentials themselves

1040
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,800
so all this kind of access channels

1041
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
needs to be verified and understood in a

1042
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,760
high

1043
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,200
idea to go through them one by one and

1044
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,240
really understand

1045
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,680
how they can be crossed uh

1046
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
treat cyber three security is a pro

1047
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,680
profit driven

1048
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,480
by incentivizing users to adopt mfa

1049
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
through customer engagement

1050
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,200
so amazing examples for me for those

1051
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
will be the mailchimp of that

1052
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
offering 10 discount for three months

1053
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,359
even the

1054
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,480
when the client to make the clients

1055
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,920
adopt the 2fa and one example is coming

1056
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,880
from the epic

1057
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,359
games came from eb games uh when they

1058
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,480
rewarded the 40

1059
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,920
fortnight players who said who

1060
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,040
been asked to set the 2fa for

1061
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,079
uh store credit

1062
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,720
avoid buying a bot management tools just

1063
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,359
because

1064
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,960
it's blocked by a bad bots so not only

1065
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,440
all bad bots are the same we mentioned a

1066
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,359
few tools that basically are the bed

1067
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,240
boards

1068
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
so we cannot really say what are the bed

1069
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,920
bots and

1070
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,280
some tool that can really uh stop the

1071
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,240
bad boys

1072
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,640
i i saw so many solutions out there

1073
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,319
talking about bad boats and

1074
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,240
every time like when i was looking at

1075
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,000
them it was very confusing

1076
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,520
what they are really trying to say and

1077
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,119
what are the bed was so

1078
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,359
just go drill down to every one of those

1079
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,960
the bad boys when they are talking about

1080
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,760
bedbots

1081
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
and understand what they are trying to

1082
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,839
prevent

1083
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,160
be aware of data access rights exploits

1084
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
and ask help if you struggle to

1085
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,599
self-regulate your user accounts

1086
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,400
so again as we discussed from the nato

1087
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,599
experiment

1088
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,480
no if you are not able to self-regulate

1089
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,119
please

1090
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,720
there are so many different companies

1091
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,880
that can help you out there so please go

1092
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,599
ahead and

1093
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,319
ask their help

1094
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,839
uh so we're going back to the

1095
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,079
one of the main factors that we have

1096
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:02,960
been asked

1097
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,839
and we spoke about this is optimize your

1098
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,359
mfa structure

1099
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,240
so creating collaboration among you ui

1100
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,119
ux developers customer experience and

1101
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,280
engineers business leads software

1102
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,119
engineers and past testers

1103
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,800
having such maybe not worry

1104
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,920
rooms but at least having such meetings

1105
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,480
with to get the idea how to configure

1106
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,520
them in the right way

1107
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,400
uh second one will be prioritize

1108
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
frictionless use

1109
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,720
ux while minimizing security risks

1110
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,680
which fits your business flows and and

1111
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,359
your requirements

1112
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,760
we we saw from our experience my

1113
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,560
experience

1114
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,760
that companies adopting the structure of

1115
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,000
mfa based on their competitors

1116
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,280
or some something that their vendors

1117
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,240
told them so so just try to understand

1118
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,520
your business flows

1119
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,079
your return flows how you return the the

1120
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,520
merchandise to the client

1121
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,920
all these kind of flaws could be

1122
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,839
structured in a way that you don't need

1123
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,200
to compromise

1124
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,280
the user experience and the last one is

1125
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,960
consider pros and cons of different

1126
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,119
structures and how to combine the three

1127
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:15,680
types of

1128
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,720
mfa in continuous adaptive and rotative

1129
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,160
authentication process i know that

1130
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,200
continuous adaptive

1131
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,839
and rotative maybe sound similar but

1132
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,400
there are

1133
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,119
every one of them is very different and

1134
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,640
that we discussed on white paper and i

1135
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,000
hope

1136
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,920
you will be able to if you are

1137
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,119
interested in this just please

1138
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,200
go ahead and ask me any question on

1139
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,160
every one of those

1140
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
photos

1141
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,960
so for users uh maybe

1142
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,440
it will be a bit unconventional but uh

1143
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,319
those are

1144
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,040
our suggestions subscribe for lookup

1145
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,319
services such as

1146
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,119
i have i've been pounded breach alarm or

1147
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,960
the hashed one of those services

1148
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,119
that could help you to get to know if

1149
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,319
you've been

1150
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,680
compromised or your account being

1151
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,599
compromised every one of them have a

1152
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,200
different kind of services that's why i

1153
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,000
mentioned

1154
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,359
so one of them will show you the

1155
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,800
password the one of them will not show

1156
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,319
you the password so depends what you're

1157
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,440
comfortable with

1158
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
again you can ask me questions about

1159
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
every one of them and i can help you

1160
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,079
to choose the best one uh use password

1161
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
managers for all your accounts

1162
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,599
that are not financially critical to you

1163
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,560
share passwords in a responsible way i'm

1164
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,119
not going to tell you not richard

1165
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,640
i can tell you that i'm sharing the

1166
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
passwords so let's just do it in a

1167
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,079
responsible way

1168
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,680
and we should not really uh

1169
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,960
say to ourselves like let's be

1170
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,720
very honest and this is what i'm saying

1171
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,040
just do you do it in a responsible way

1172
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,000
because many of us are sharing passwords

1173
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,839
and this is something that being

1174
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,880
as we as we said before acceptable by

1175
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,000
many companies as well

1176
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
get familiar with a with a way to set

1177
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,160
security freeze on credit reports in

1178
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,280
your country

1179
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,680
very important to be very available to

1180
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,839
any of the if any of those will try to

1181
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,040
contact you so

1182
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,359
be sure that you have your your email

1183
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,319
your

1184
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,359
phone number updated stay available to

1185
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,240
your critical

1186
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
uh stay available to your critical

1187
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,400
account providers

1188
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,560
and don't follow biased services and

1189
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,319
studies those that we saw

1190
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,880
so many of them during our study using

1191
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,400
multi-factor authentication blocks 99.9

1192
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,160
of the account hacks two factor

1193
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,119
authentication blocks 100 automated

1194
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,240
off automated bot hacks

1195
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,720
these two were mentioned by two tech

1196
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,160
giants but i don't really want to

1197
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,240
mention their names

1198

1201
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,720
yubikey is a cool concept

1202
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,040
but do we really need one more physical

1203
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,520
key in our pockets

1204
