1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,480
hello everyone i call wise networking

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,600
technology

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,400
invisible threads they can be carried

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,720
out

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,639
easily and their effect can be very high

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,200
there are attacks that can directly

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,759
affect

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,119
users corporate and sometimes devices

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,359
in this presentation i will explain how

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,199
we can fight against invisible threat

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,560
and

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,119
we will answer a question what's going

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,679
on the air

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,559
but firstly i want to talk about myself

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
when i look at myself in general there

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
are a few key words i can use about me

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
there's our co-founder author speaker

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
and trainer apart from this

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,879
there is not much i can say for myself

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
actually we have a four main problem in

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,480
the wi-fi security one of them

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,280
is the realization of attacks one of the

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,360
most important factors that increase the

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,000
security

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
risk on wise network is that cyber

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,879
attacker opened the attack tools

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,438
they have developed the infiltrator

28
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,240
network in

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
open source platform for everyone to use

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,320
the installation

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
operation effects and function of these

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
attacks tools are documented

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
in detail and made public

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
making it possible for even users who

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
do not hire high-level computer

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,080
technology skills to perform

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,119
cyber aggressive behavior with easy

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
procedures

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,880
and another one usage habits of

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
users wireless network users create

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
a connection request in order to be able

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
to connect to the access points around

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,720
with

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
their devices like phone tablet computer

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,799
this connection request calls the users

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
collect information about location they

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,360
have visited before

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
in addition users own devices do

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,960
not have the ability to think based on

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
location causing

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
users to connect a fake access point the

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
main reason for this is that users

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,280
do not delete the network information

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,160
they have

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
connected to from the device memory

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
another user problem is the user's

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
habits of

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,959
using free and passwordless wireless

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,160
networks

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,440
this network has have more security

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,480
weakness

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
than other wireless networks to

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,440
to their passwordless nature

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
in case of an internet interruption user

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
devices are often configured by users

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,519
to automatically reconnect to this

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,720
networks

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
the situation causes the connected

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
devices

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
and the user information on this devices

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
to become

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
targets that can be easily identified by

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
attackers

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
there's basic problems yes i've

75
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,239
brought some risk with them the most

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,959
important of them accessibility major

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
the emergence of national security

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,080
threats

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,159
compromise of privacy and

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,440
data losses

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,360
here is the good example for the

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,040
emergency of national

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
security threats uh in a report

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,840
published in bbc in 2018

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,040
that security services captured four

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
russian agents with diplomatic passport

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
while they were about to carry out a

88
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
cyber attack against organization for

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,959
prohibition of chemical weapons in the

90
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,599
hay

91
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,238
with a pineapple in their hands

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,720
but it is very good method

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
to get now the attackers before talking

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
about solutions

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
wifi attackers usually use the following

96
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,599
methods

97
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,239
and generally create open wi-fi networks

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,360
for do attacks and create a fake access

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
point with interesting ssid for

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,399
capturing clients like free free fast

101
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,160
coffee

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
and collect all properties from client

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
devices for great effects

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
fake access point and create a similar

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
ssid

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
broadcast and sometimes can create same

107
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,240
ssid

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
and use non uh wi-fi hacking

109
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
tools this

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
uh those are simple but effective

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,560
methods

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,080
basically all target protocol and human

113
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,639
behavior

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
this is our solution wiper hunter and

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,040
today we will talk about this project

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,039
and methods is a open source project for

117
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,880
fight against wifi hackers and

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
it includes many methods related to

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
fingerprinting

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
monitoring confusion technique and

121
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,160
active difference

122
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,880
and i will explain some methods from

123
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,520
this

124
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
project

125
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,840
however it would be good to now the

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
normal behavior of an access point

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,000
before

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
we start talk about wifi security thus

129
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
we can interpret threats

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
more easily and as you know and access

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
points and beacon packets to announce

132
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,639
itself

133
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
and probe response packet to initiate

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
the connections

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
and access points sometimes can uh

136
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
create a probe request packets

137
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
uh it is possible if access point try

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
connect to the

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
another access point like client

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
uh here i want to show you how the karma

141
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
attacker works

142
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,560
the client constantly

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
search around for network in its memory

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
and wants to connect if there is a

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,560
karma attack in the environment it lies

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
and devices see it

147
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,080
that it's all as

148
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
a result of the operation of this

149
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
model this attack there are some changes

150
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,440
in the

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,759
environment you can see

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,120
more than one ssid information

153
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,960
from unique mac addresses

154
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,720
appear the number of rob response

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
is increasing because always send pro

156
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
response to all clients

157
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
and please keep this note in mind

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,560
a karma attacker does not send beacon

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
packets

160
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,800
here another attacker method

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
i want to show you how the pineapp model

162
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
works

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,039
firstly collect ssid information from

164
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:13,520
air

165
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
and create ssid pool and

166
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
open fake access point with this

167
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
information in the

168
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,400
ssid pool as

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,680
a result of the operation of this

170
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
module there are some changes in the

171
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
environment

172
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,400
the number of unencrypted network is

173
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
increasing

174
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
but about encrypted and unencrypted

175
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,080
version

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,240
of the same wireless network appear and

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
networks that never exited before are

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
starting to appear

179
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
that's all let's talk

180
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,479
about some wi-fi security methods for

181
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,039
blue team members

182
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,479
first of them this is

183
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,919
pardons and pidens

184
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
can monitor illegal wi-fi network

185
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,440
activities

186
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
like ssid brute force become fluid the

187
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
authentication attacks

188
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,879
same ssid broadcast

189
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,120
and karma attacks and wifi pineapple

190
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
activities

191
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
this tool is mostly most popular

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
for bulletin because has a lot of

193
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
methods in one box

194
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,719
you can install this tool and monitor

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,599
logs for

196
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,320
malicious wi-fi activities

197
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,880
this is another blue team method and

198
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,839
tools

199
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
uh name of this method and tool

200
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
pinocchio

201
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
you know pinocchio yeah if dress like

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
wi-fi pineapple

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
attacks or karma attacks are active

204
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
around user b

205
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,760
will be informed about this threat you

206
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,480
can

207
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
you can imagine a pinocchio

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,920
project as a proxy agent in the air

209
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,680
pinocchio collect all proper tests

210
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
spreads mac addresses from probably case

211
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
create a new process with the collected

212
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
mac addresses

213
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,240
and send publicus with this information

214
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
and if uh wi-fi

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
and if there is a some attacker in the

216
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,839
environment

217
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,360
uh creates a

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
fake access point with this information

219
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
and as you see

220
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
the informant user about wi-fi threads

221
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
in the

222
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
environment with pinocchio

223
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,600
this is a result of this process

224
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,120
this tool basically allows tracking user

225
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,959
activity name of tools

226
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,120
pi user it's simple works like this

227
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
examine pro requests in the environment

228
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
to the term

229
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
determine if they have previously

230
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,000
connected the malicious wi-fi network

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
thus

232
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,640
the number of people who are likely to

233
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,000
fall into the potential potential fake

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
access point in the environment

235
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,760
is determined

236
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
if you use this tool a method for

237
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
cooperation environment

238
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,079
you can monitor

239
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,200
company name in proper case or

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,079
you can monitor blacklisted society in

241
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
proper case for

242
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
font who are likely to fall into

243
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
potential fake access point

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
if you use this just for clients

245
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
you can analyze behavior the client of

246
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,399
the corporation

247
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
with this proper case

248
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
and you can find a lot of information

249
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,760
about the users

250
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,079
here is the first module of the vapor

251
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
hunter project and this tool most

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
popular in this project

253
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
because detect most popular and other

254
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,800
project

255
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,480
wi-fi pineapple activities the goal

256
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
of this project is to find out the fake

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
access point opened by wi-fi pineapple

258
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
devices using the pineapple model

259
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,600
and to prevent client from being ac

260
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640
affected by initiating the

261
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
authentication attack to

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
the attacking devices

263
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
here is the working chain for python it

264
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,399
is basic

265
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
but so effective firstly

266
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
i am doing channel hoping for

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,519
sniffing and collect all beacon packets

268
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,839
and save ssid and mac information

269
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,760
and i'm sending this information to

270
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
our analyzing function for search

271
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,839
uh pineapple activities and tracks

272
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,000
and if i found some activities

273
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,880
i'm sending this information to the find

274
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
channel

275
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,880
search the channel information for the

276
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,279
detected devices

277
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480
and i'm doing the authentication attacks

278
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,200
after channel information after set

279
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
channel information

280
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
and as you know we can

281
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,920
detect and send authentication packet to

282
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,320
the

283
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
wi-fi pineapple and we can save

284
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,480
all clients we tested this

285
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,240
module in defcon and blackhead and it is

286
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,880
successful

287
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
this is pickup parser for traps

288
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
and can find wi-fi pineapple activities

289
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,959
with

290
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,000
pickup analyze it is basically

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
like with pi server but can

292
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,839
parse pickup file and work

293
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,200
offline you can download

294
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,360
from github and

295
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,279
you can try yeah

296
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,200
this is p trap project

297
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
the purpose of this tool is designed to

298
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,959
confuse

299
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,079
those who want to

300
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,600
trap clients by opening fake enterprise

301
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,560
access point and generating fake data

302
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,440
with this tool if there are some wi-fi

303
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
hacker

304
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,519
in environmental maybe you can trick

305
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,760
them

306
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
and thank you for listening you can
