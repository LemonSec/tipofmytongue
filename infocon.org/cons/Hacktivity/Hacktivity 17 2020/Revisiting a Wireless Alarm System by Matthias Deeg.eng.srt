00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,000
hello everybody

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,040
my name is matthias digg welcome to my

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,599
talk

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,320
there is always one more bug or more

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,560
revisiting a wireless alarm system

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,000
at activity 2020 online edition

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
as the title of this talk suggests there

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
is still one more bug to be found

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
or at least this is often humorously

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
attributed to various it products

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
no matter whether they are soft firm or

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,000
hardware

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
by people dealing with them within the

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
next couple of minutes

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
i want to show that this assumption is

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,680
sometimes very true

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,920
using the example of a wireless alarm

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
system and some of its accessories

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
in which yet another security

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
vulnerability could be found over the

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,520
past few years

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,559
more than once but before we get to

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,600
interesting things

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
let me briefly introduce myself as

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,440
mentioned before

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,600
my name is matthias dieg and i've been

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
working as an i.t security consultant

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
for the german ide security company sus

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
since 2007. i'm also head of research

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,040
and development

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
and in charge of our responsible

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
disclosure program

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
regarding security vulnerabilities i've

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
been interested in information

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,439
technology

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,560
since my early days and very curious in

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,439
general

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,920
whether security assumptions in soft

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080
firm or hardware hold through when

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
taking a closer look

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
the agenda for this talk is as follows

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
first i'm going to give a very short

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
introduction to the used technology

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,759
of the tested target device an arbor

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
sequest wireless alarm system

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
and some of its accessories then i want

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
to give an overview of our research

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,680
the use test methodology and the

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,119
involved people

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
in the last few years there has also

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
been published research on wireless

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
alarm systems by

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
other researchers that i want to mention

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
next i'm going to talk about the attack

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
surface and attack scenarios

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
which are relevant for a wireless alarm

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
system

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
then i want to present the actual

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
security vulnerabilities

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
of our research that we have found and

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
reported

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
and for most of them i have also

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,319
prepared short demos

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,160
finally i'm going to draw some

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
conclusions and want to give some

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
recommendations concerning wireless

68
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
alarm systems

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
and at the end of my talk we have some

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,640
time for q and a

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
here you can see the main target device

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
of this presentation

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
an arbor stack quest wireless alarm

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
system and some of its accessories

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,959
a wireless motion detector a wireless

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,160
remote control

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,519
and a proximity chip key later on

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
you will also see two more components

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
for the abu sequest wireless alarm

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
system not shown here

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
namely a wireless control device and a

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
hybrid module

83
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
as the word wireless in wireless alarm

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
system implies

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
the different components are using radio

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,480
technology

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
for communication purposes all

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
accessories besides the proximity chip

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,920
key

90
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,360
use radio communication in the 863

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
to 870 megahertz frequency band

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
on 868.6625 megahertz

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
the rfid communication of the proximity

94
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,159
key

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
is in the 13.56 megahertz frequency

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
range

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
on this slide you can see a top view of

98
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,440
the abu sequest main panel's pcb

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
with an arm-based sd electronics

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,599
microcontroller and a flash memory chip

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,920
for conducting security analysis of the

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
wireless alarm system and performing

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,959
actual attacks

104
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
the software defined radio hacker f1 and

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,879
the radio dongle

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
yardstick one both by greatscot gadgets

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
were used

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,599
in my experience these two radio hacking

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,120
tools work reliably

110
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
and are good enough at least for my

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,159
needs the hacker f1 is supported by most

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
sdr software tools for instance

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,799
new radio companion or universal radio

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,760
hacker

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,840
the yardstick 1 makes use of the quite

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
popular sub 1 gigahertz transceiver

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
cc 1111 by texas instruments

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
and comes with the rfcad firmware

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
installed

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,358
another tool used during this research

121
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,918
project is the erika neighbor developed

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,120
by thomas dietert

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
for the greatpat1 this device provides

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,639
four

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,840
texas instruments cc1101 transceivers

126
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,360
that can be tuned for different

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,440
frequency bands namely 315

128
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,280
433 868

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
or 915 megahertz the proper

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
configuration of two transceivers per

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,680
frequency band

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
allows for short reaction times required

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
in specific test cases

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
for instance concerning reactive jamming

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,360
attacks as you will see

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
later besides the presenter test

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,560
equipment

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
some experiments and proof of concept

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
attacks were also implemented

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
on a teensy development board with a

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
corresponding cc1101 module

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
or on another device with a cool form

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,600
factor that you will see

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
in one of the demos two important

145
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,639
technical facts about the wireless

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,440
communication

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,199
of the arbor sequest wireless alarm

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,360
system and its components are

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
that differential manchester encoding is

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
used and

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,039
that the integrity of radio packets is

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
checked via a 16-bit

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
crc our research of wireless alarm

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,360
systems

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
actually started back in 2016 when my

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
colleague gerard klostermeier

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
and i decided to analyze different

158
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,160
mostly low-cost wireless alarm systems

159
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,880
for the simplest radio based attack the

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
replay attack

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
the discount store aldi on the opposite

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
side of the street

163
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
back then was selling a quite affordable

164
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
wireless alarm system set

165
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
named easyhome which started this

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
research project

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
in which we tested several wireless

168
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
alarm systems by different manufacturers

169
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
the abu sagres wireless alarm system

170
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,280
happened to be the most expensive of our

171
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,639
test devices

172
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,360
our main test result back then was that

173
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
all tested wireless alarm systems

174
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
were vulnerable to a simple replay

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,479
attack

176
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,120
and to be honest i was surprised by this

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
a little bit

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,639
because i had assumed that a security

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,319
product like an alarm system

180
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
offers better protection in autumn 2016

181
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
we published our findings on german

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,880
television in the tv show plus minos

183
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
and raised the security awareness for

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,199
this kind of security issue

185
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
the abu sequest wireless alarm system

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
that we had bought was still available

187
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
after this research project for further

188
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
tests

189
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,639
but at first was stowed away in our lab

190
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,280
some time later we got a tip by thomas

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,000
stated

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
that the security fix for our repotted

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,599
replay vulnerability

194
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,240
introduced new security vulnerabilities

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
in the arbor segwest wireless alarm

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,440
system

197
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
thus with external support first by

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
thomas stated

199
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,599
and later on also by mikhail rutgers we

200
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
had some further looks at the abu

201
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
sakhwest wireless alarm system

202
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,120
and found some more security

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
vulnerabilities within the last two

204
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,919
years

205
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,479
which we have reported to abuse in the

206
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
course of our responsible disclosure

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
program

208
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
when analyzing the wireless alarm

209
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
systems we actually did not follow our

210
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
usual three-part test methodology

211
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
for radio based devices including a

212
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,639
hardware analysis

213
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
a radio based analysis and firmware

214
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
analysis

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
but this time we only used the radio

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
based analysis

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
fortunately this was enough to find some

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,680
security vulnerabilities

219
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
as with almost every topic there is

220
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
previous research

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,919
on this slide i have listed several

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,039
other publications

223
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
regarding the security of wireless alarm

224
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,240
systems

225
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
which has been released within the last

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
couple of years and

227
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
that i'm aware of so hacking wireless

228
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,520
alarm systems

229
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
is anything but new but i hope that with

230
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
our latest research

231
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,759
i am presenting here i can add some

232
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
interesting material to this topic

233
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
concerning the attack surface of

234
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
wireless alarm systems and different

235
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
relevant attack scenarios

236
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
there is not that much to consider in my

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
opinion

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
attacks requiring direct physical

239
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
hardware access are less interesting

240
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,360
and attacks that can be performed via

241
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
radio signals from some safe distance

242
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,639
only requiring physical proximity to the

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,599
target device

244
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,479
are more interesting different kinds of

245
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,039
attacks

246
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,200
against radio based systems that come to

247
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,120
mind are replay attacks

248
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,279
brute force attacks denial of service

249
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
attacks jamming attacks

250
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,839
slithing attacks spoofing attacks and

251
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
cloning attacks

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
the last one referring to rfid

253
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
communication

254
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
here you can see an overview of the 8

255
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
security vulnerabilities we have found

256
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
regarding the arbor segwest wireless

257
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
alarm system

258
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,240
and some of its accessories

259
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
the first security issue i want to talk

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
about is

261
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
simple replay attacks for exploiting

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
this security vulnerability

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
an attacker just has to record an

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
interesting radio signal

265
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
for example a disarm signal for

266
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
deactivating the wireless alarm system

267
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,839
and to replay it later at the right

268
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,920
moment when proprietary radio protocols

269
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
are used in wireless devices

270
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
they are often missing a replay

271
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
protection or only have an insufficient

272
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,040
one

273
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
as mentioned earlier all wireless alarm

274
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,959
systems that we have tested back in 2016

275
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
were vulnerable to simple replay attacks

276
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,320
this kind of attack enables an attacker

277
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
to deactivate an affected wireless alarm

278
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,120
system

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,279
in an unauthorized manner in 2016

280
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,680
we exemplarily demonstrated such a

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
simple replay attack in the german tv

282
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
show plus minus

283
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
on this slide you can see the probably

284
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
most simple flow graph for new radio

285
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,519
companion

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
which we use for our replay attacks

287
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
the second type of attack i want to

288
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
present here is a rolling code attack

289
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
in order to fix the replay security

290
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
vulnerability we had reported

291
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
arbus implemented a rolling code in your

292
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
remote controls of the

293
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,959
arbor segwest wireless alarm system and

294
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
claim to use secure wireless

295
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
communication now

296
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
as you can see on the corresponding

297
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
product website

298
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
but as thomas data found out the chosen

299
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
rolling code implementation was

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
cryptographically weak it was actually

301
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,160
so

302
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,959
cryptographically weak that by observing

303
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
the unencrypted radio signals

304
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
it was possible to deduce the used

305
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
rolling code algorithm

306
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
and by knowing the rolling code

307
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
algorithm and its current state

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
an attacker can deactivate the wireless

309
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
alarm system

310
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,839
in an unauthorized way or perform 18

311
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,959
hour service attack

312
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
against the wireless remote control by

313
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
desynchronizing it

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,399
in the next demo i want to demonstrate a

315
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,000
successful rolling code attack

316
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,320
our test setup consists of three parts

317
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
and our sequest wireless alarm system

318
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,399
an abu sagres wireless motion detector

319
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
and an abu sequest wireless remote

320
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,959
control

321
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
let's see if our test setup is working

322
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,760
properly

323
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:43,839
sounds good

324
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
with the configured wireless remote

325
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,000
control the wireless alarm system

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
can be conveniently armed or disarmed

327
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:11,200
the activation was successful

328
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,000
the deactivation also worked as intended

329
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
now it's time for our proof of concept

330
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,839
attack

331
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
the attacker listens for an arm signal

332
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,920
to learn the current rolling code state

333
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,240
and later sends a disarm signal with a

334
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,800
correct rolling code

335
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
the predictable rolling codes enable an

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
attacker to successfully deactivate the

337
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,399
wireless alarm system

338
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
in an unauthorized manner

339
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,000
as a matter of fact now no alarm is

340
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
triggered

341
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
we have also developed a python proof of

342
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,399
concept tool using

343
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,839
a yardstick one

344
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,600
the unauthorized deactivation of the

345
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,959
wireless alarm system

346
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,839
worked as expected

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,560
another proof of concept tool using 18z

348
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,600
3.2 with a cc1101 module

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
was developed by thomas dietet who found

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the security vulnerability

351
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,480
for demonstration purposes this proof of

352
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
concept implementation

353
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
auto magically deactivates the wireless

354
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,199
alarm system

355
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:03,839
after a couple of seconds

356
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,320
the third type of attack i want to show

357
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
you is a proximity key cloning attack

358
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,920
the other sequest wireless alarm system

359
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,839
supports so-called proximity chip keys

360
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,440
unfortunately the insecure rfid

361
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
technology myfair classic is used for

362
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
those proximity keys

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
thus an attacker with one time access

364
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
can easily read the information stored

365
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
on such a proximity key

366
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,720
in a very short time from distances up

367
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
to 1 meter

368
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,199
depending on the used rfid reader

369
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,440
this allows for simple cloning an arbor

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
sequence proximity chip key

371
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,760
and deactivating an affected wireless

372
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
alarm system in an

373
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,880
unauthorized manner in the next demo

374
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
a successful proximity key cloning

375
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,399
attack is demonstrated

376
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,600
our test setup consists of three parts

377
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
an abu sequest wireless alarm system

378
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,680
an abu sequest wireless motion detector

379
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,120
and an auvo sequest proximity key

380
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,440
let's see if our test setup is working

381
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
properly

382
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:41,839
sounds good

383
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
an alarm was triggered thus we have to

384
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:55,839
manually reset the wireless alarm system

385
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
activate

386
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
now it's time for our proximity key

387
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
cloning proof of concept attack

388
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,079
using a handy pocket computer also known

389
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,720
as smartphone

390
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
first we use the android app my fair

391
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
classic tool by gerhard klostermeier

392
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,199
to read the contents of the abu sagr's

393
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:37,839
proximity key

394
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,199
then we use a somewhat special blank my

395
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,480
fair classic card

396
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
and write the previously read contents

397
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,480
to it

398
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
we enable an advanced feature to also

399
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,639
write a manufacturer block

400
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
and write all sectors although in this

401
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,839
case it would be sufficient to only

402
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,320
write block 0 of sector 0

403
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
containing the device uid

404
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,400
now we should be good to deactivate the

405
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,559
wireless alarm system with our clone

406
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,439
proximity key

407
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,199
success we disarm the wireless alarm

408
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,760
system with a cloned rfid token

409
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,039
in an unauthorized way as a matter of

410
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,679
fact

411
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,720
no alarm is triggered now

412
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,600
for rfid and nfc security tests and

413
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
demonstration purposes

414
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,799
there are also other great tools

415
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
available

416
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,039
for example the chameleon mini which is

417
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
a versatile nfc device

418
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
with a cool form factor

419
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,840
programmed correctly

420
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
it can also serve as a proximity key for

421
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:14,720
the abu sagquest wireless alarm system

422
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
last but not least i want to demonstrate

423
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
a third way to perform a simple rfid

424
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:29,840
cloning attack

425
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,360
this time i want to use this blue myfair

426
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,960
classic rfid token

427
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
in order to deactivate our wireless

428
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
alarm system

429
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,840
now it doesn't work

430
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,120
but this very user-friendly device from

431
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,840
china can help us with that

432
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
first we read the content of the

433
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
original

434
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
second process

435
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
5 then we write it to our blue rfid

436
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,200
token

437
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
let's see if the cloned rfid token works

438
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,960
as good as the original one

439
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
success we disarm the wireless alarm

440
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
system with a cloned rfid token

441
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,320
in an unauthorized way once again

442
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
the fourth radio based attack i want to

443
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
talk about

444
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,640
is a so called reactive jamming attack

445
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
the abu sequest wireless alarm system

446
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
has an rf jamming detection

447
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,480
which can be configured to trigger an

448
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,679
alarm if there are

449
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,320
unusual interferences on the used radio

450
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,440
channel

451
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
however thomas diet found out that the

452
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
implemented rf jamming detection

453
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
is insufficient as short jamming signals

454
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,000
are not detected

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
and won't trigger an alarm therefore an

456
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
attacker is able to perform

457
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,320
a reactive jamming attack the idea of

458
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,159
radio jamming attacks in general

459
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,240
is to exploit the used shell medium of

460
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,600
wireless transmissions

461
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
the electromagnetic spectrum in order to

462
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,799
disrupt a targeted radio transmission

463
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,679
using a specific wavelength an attacker

464
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,159
simply transmits his own radio signal

465
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
interfering with the original one this

466
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,000
results

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
in the intended receiver of the radio

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
transmission not being able to correctly

469
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,520
receive the original signal anymore

470
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,000
reactive jamming means that an attacker

471
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,520
reacts to specific wireless

472
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,559
transmissions

473
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,159
and only tries to disrupt those for this

474
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,400
the start of an rf message of a wireless

475
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
alarm system component

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,559
for instance a motion detector has to be

477
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,360
detected

478
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,480
and quickly after this event a stronger

479
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
attacker controlled signal has to be

480
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,679
sent

481
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,520
by performing a successful reactive

482
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
jamming attack it is possible to

483
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,240
suppress

484
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
correctly received rf messages of the

485
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,760
wireless alarm system

486
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,480
in an unauthorized manner for instance

487
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,039
to prevent alarms

488
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
on this slide overlaying an original

489
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,919
signal with a stronger attacker signal

490
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,000
during a reactive jamming attack is

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
illustrated

492
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,559
in the following demo i will show a

493
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,360
successful reactive jamming attack

494
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
here you can see the used test setup

495
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,840
with an abu segwest wireless alarm

496
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,559
system

497
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,360
a wireless motion detector and the great

498
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
fat one with the erica neighbor

499
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
connected to the attacker system

500
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,440
first let's activate the wireless alarm

501
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,159
system

502
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,720
and see if an alarm is triggered via the

503
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,840
motion detector

504
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
as you can hear the test setup works

505
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
fine

506
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
we reset the wireless alarm system and

507
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,039
activate it

508
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
again

509
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,840
now we start the reactive jamming attack

510
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
using our developed software tool

511
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,879
reactive jammer

512
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,720
while the reactive jammer is running it

513
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
detects wireless transmissions

514
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,960
of all components of the abu segwest

515
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
wireless alarm system

516
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,000
for instance the wireless motion

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
detector and

518
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,520
overlays it with another stronger signal

519
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
thus the receiver in this case the alarm

520
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,600
panel

521
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,000
is not able to properly decode the

522
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,919
original transmitted message

523
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,600
and no alarm is triggered furthermore

524
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,520
our reactive jamming attack did not

525
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,039
trigger the jamming protection

526
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,200
of the arbor sequest wireless alarm

527
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,679
system

528
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,159
the fifth type of attack i want to

529
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,880
present is a sniffing attack

530
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
the targeted device in this attack is

531
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,520
another segways wireless control device

532
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
you can see here arbus claims on its

533
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,520
product website

534
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
that this device also uses secure

535
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
wireless communication

536
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
but michael ritkes and thomas data found

537
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,840
out

538
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,080
that the used wireless communication of

539
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,600
the wireless control device

540
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
is not so secure as it is missing

541
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,360
encryption

542
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,200
hence by simply observing the

543
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
corresponding radio signals

544
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,279
it is possible to see all transmitted

545
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,919
sensitive data as clear text

546
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
this enables an attacker to gain access

547
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
to sensitive data

548
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,080
like pin codes and proximity token ids

549
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,159
and to deactivate the wireless alarm

550
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:16,720
system

551
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480
in an unauthorized way once again

552
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,559
in the next demo successful sniffing

553
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,400
attacks against the arbor stack quest

554
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,720
wireless control device are demonstrated

555
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
here you can see the use test setup with

556
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
an abu segwest wireless alarm system

557
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
a wireless motion detector the wireless

558
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,159
control device

559
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,720
and a yardstick one connected to the

560
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,039
attacker system

561
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,120
in order to eavesdrop on the wireless

562
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
communication of the alarm system

563
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,679
the attacker simply starts our developed

564
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,279
python tool

565
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
this pin sniffer proof of concept tool

566
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,320
listens for specific arbus data packets

567
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,360
on the correct 868 megahertz radio

568
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,480
frequency

569
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,679
used for the wireless communication

570
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,159
thus when the alarm system is armed via

571
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,000
the wireless control panel

572
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
the attacker can receive and decode the

573
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
corresponding data packet

574
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
in order to gain access to the use clear

575
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,600
text pin code

576
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,799
as a matter of fact the eavesdrop pin

577
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,200
code can be used to disable the wireless

578
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
alarm system

579
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
in an unauthorized way

580
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,879
the system is unset

581
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,720
besides using a pin code for arming and

582
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,960
disarming the abu sequest wireless alarm

583
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,840
system

584
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,120
it is also possible to use an rfid token

585
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,439
also called proximity or chip key

586
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
for eavesdropping on the wireless

587
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,480
communication the attacker simply starts

588
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,840
another developed python tool

589
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
and now when the rfid token is used with

590
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
the wireless control device

591
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,480
fube 5001 an attacker can receive

592
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
and decode the corresponding data packet

593
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
in order to gain access

594
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,480
to the use proximity key id by knowing

595
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,440
this id

596
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
it is possible to create a cloned rfid

597
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,880
token

598
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
here you can see the attacker's blue

599
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,120
proximity key

600
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,840
without having the correct programmed id

601
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,440
but this can be changed by using a very

602
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,600
user-friendly device from china

603
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,919
that enables us to write arbitrary

604
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:52,880
serial numbers

605
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:06,640

the system is unset success

612
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,840
the attacker could deactivate the

613
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,360
wireless alarm system

614
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,399
with a cloned rfid token using the

615
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,399
sniffed proximity key id

616
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,239
in an unauthorized way

617
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
on this slide you can see the output of

618
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
our develop proof of concept tool for

619
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,080
a successful pin code sniffing attack

620
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,320
the sixth and last kind of attack i want

621
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,679
to show you in this talk

622
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,720
is a spoofing attack the targeted device

623
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,559
in this attack is an arbor stack quest

624
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,760
hybrid module

625
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
which can be used to extend an arbor sag

626
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
quest wireless alarm system

627
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,480
with wired components and to integrate

628
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,600
the arbus w

629
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,880
applox access control system the issue

630
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,520
here is

631
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
that the used wireless communication of

632
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
this hybrid module is missing security

633
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,640
features

634
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,000
regarding confidentiality and integrity

635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,159
this enables an attacker to deactivate

636
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,760
the wireless alarm system in an

637
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
unauthorized manner

638
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
or to perform an authentication bypass

639
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,080
attack regarding the w applox access

640
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,039
control system

641
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,880
in a corresponding system configuration

642
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,120
in the next and final demo a successful

643
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,080
spoofing attack

644
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
against an apostate quest wireless alarm

645
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,320
system with a hybrid module

646
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,720
is demonstrated

647
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
here you can see the used test setup

648
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,200
with an abu segwest wireless alarm

649
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,000
system

650
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,480
a wireless motion detector the hybrid

651
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,279
module fumo 50110

652
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,600
with a programmed switch key switch

653
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,960
configuration

654
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
and a yardstick one connected to the

655
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,320
attacker system

656
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
the

657
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,130
[Music]

658
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,640
the system is sending

659
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
in order to perform a spoofing attack

660
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,320
against the insecure wireless

661
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,520
communication

662
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
the attacker simply starts our developed

663
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,399
python tool

664
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,640
this software tool listens for specific

665
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,919
status packets

666
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,919
that are sent from the hybrid module to

667
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,600
the wireless alarm panel

668
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
at regular time intervals of about two

669
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,840
and a half minutes

670
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,919
when a packet containing a status

671
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,600
message from the hybrid module is

672
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,559
received

673
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,799
the attacker can launch a disarming

674
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,120
attack using a spoofed radio packet

675
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,480
the system is unset and successfully

676
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,720
disarm the wireless alarm system

677
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,480
in an unauthorized way

678
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,440
now it's time to draw some conclusions

679
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,279
in order to have a better picture

680
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
it is good to know the current patch

681
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,799
status for the 8 security

682
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,960
vulnerabilities i was talking about in

683
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,480
the last few minutes

684
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,799
to my knowledge up to now only the

685
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,840
missing protection

686
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,720
against replay attacks was fixed all

687
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
other described security vulnerabilities

688
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
can still be found and exploited

689
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,039
in the corresponding arbus sequence

690
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,960
products

691
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,840
with that i come to the conclusions that

692
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,000
security products like wireless alarm

693
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,880
systems

694
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,640
may be more vulnerable to different

695
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
types of radio based attacks

696
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,039
than you would probably first assume

697
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,519
that marketing claims regarding security

698
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,240
features

699
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,519
may just be that marketing claims that

700
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,720
product certificates

701
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
like vds home and en 5131

702
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,159
grade 2 may give a false sense of

703
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,519
security

704
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,519
that some security vulnerabilities are

705
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,279
hard or even impossible to fix in

706
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,240
hardware products

707
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,799
already in use for example when no

708
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,720
update functionality exists

709
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
or when there are compatibility issues

710
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,039
concerning other devices you have to

711
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,399
consider

712
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,559
and that so-called forever bucks may

713
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,399
affect the security of a product

714
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,600
until its end of life

715
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,080
based on our research and my experience

716
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,679
with wireless alarm systems

717
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,399
i therefore recommend to choose wireless

718
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
alarm systems wisely

719
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
to perform a thorough online research

720
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,279
before buying such a product

721
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,600
to reconsider your previous decision for

722
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,679
using a wireless alarm system

723
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,000
to not have too much faith in product

724
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,480
certificates and marketing claims

725
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,880
and finally to ask the manufacturer or

726
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,200
vendor for further security testing

727
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,320
beyond product certification and this is

728
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,440
very important

729
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,679
the scope of those tests if there were

730
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,919
any

731
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,399
on the next three slides i have put

732
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,000
together several references

733
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,919
to further information about different

734
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,320
things regarding wireless alarm systems

735
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,918
i have mentioned in this talk

736
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
so this is it i hope you've enjoyed my

737
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,799
talk

738
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,840
thank you very much for your attention

739
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:43,840
do you have any questions

740
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,918
you
