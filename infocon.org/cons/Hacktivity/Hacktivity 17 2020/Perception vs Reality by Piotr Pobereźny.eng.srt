1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,120
hello and welcome

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
to the perception versus reality

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,799
presentation

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,120
today i want to ask you the question

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,000
that

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
are we losing the cyber war or we just

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,040
simply give the field to the cyber

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,400
criminals

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
on our own wish to answer that question

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,439
let me introduce myself and

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
to show you the angle i want to

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,240
present this answer to this question

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
so my name is pietro berezner and i'm

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,160
senior solution

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
senior security solution architect in

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,440
quality

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,160
but previously before that position i

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,399
was holding

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
a group tesol position in two big

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,960
insurance companies so i want to blend

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,680
in

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
toes to angles into one

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
presentations from the vendor

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
perspective but of course

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,680
from the tsa perspective but enough

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,719
talk let's fight so first

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,760
let me introduce the idea behind of

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,360
creation of this

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,400
slides of this presentation so i came

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
across this slide or this

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
cartoon created by joe vest and

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
this is a pinpoint for me how the

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,200
perception

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
works in the majority of the

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
organizations so they are spending a lot

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,240
of

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,520
tough effort actually to end up

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,320
with a completely unmanageable and

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
completely uneffective

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
solutions most of the sea level

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
uh executives in the companies thinks

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,119
if they have an antivirus they have a

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,720
insurance

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
and they have maybe some firewalls so

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
they are solved so

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
why they need to spend more money more

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
effort

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,600
for the security well if you look on the

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,280
right side of the screen

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
this friendly but not friendly guy in

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,880
the black hat

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
is simply not disturbed

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
and this guy can do

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,520
whatever it will whatever it wish

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,680
to do with our environments

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
because we are not managing

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
the environment in effective way so was

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
the reality

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
let's play a game

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
about that so

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
how do you think what's the real average

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
coverage of the vulnerability management

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
program in your organizations

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
including all type of devices including

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
all type of software

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,480
and on these devices how many how many

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
of them are effectively

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,599
covered and managed uh across his

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
environment

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
so from the perspective

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
of various

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,360
companies of various types of companies

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,080
i i

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
had i have experienced

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
this number is very

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
very low it's about 12 percent

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,920
and 12 percent only that

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
the area is managed in any way

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,799
the rest of the environment is

80
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,400
completely unmanaged so

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
if there is any vulnerability out there

82
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,040
and if they are exploitable or not they

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,080
simply are left behind

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,560
so we don't have an ability or capacity

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
to manage them so

86
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
why is that why is happening like that

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,560
to answer that question i want to play a

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
game with you

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
which in my country in poland is called

90
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
familiada

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
so i created somehow

92
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
this kind of game for cyber security

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,640
experts

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
it will be very short but the questions

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
one of the question is

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
what type of software in most of the

97
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
companies have a biggest number of

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
vulnerabilities with the public exploits

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
and this in general i want to focus

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
in i want to focus on the

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
vulnerabilities which

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,680
consists or full or public exploits

103
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
are available for those vulnerabilities

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
so they can be easily detonated

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,000
in the in the organization so

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
let's make a list based on my experience

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,160
i'm

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
i'm guessing that your experience may be

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,639
also familiar most of the companies are

110
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
focusing on the operating system on

111
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,759
patching and

112
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
managing the vulnerabilities on the on

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
the operating systems in the first place

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,759
as a first attack surface and the most

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,960
serious especially

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
in the in the internet facing

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
productional

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
uh servers which is true

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
this is very true but in terms of the

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
priority in terms of question we are

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
asking here

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
about the type of software that have the

123
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,400
biggest numbers of

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
vulnerabilities with the public exit

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
which actually

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
from my perspective is posing

127
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
exponentially

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
bigger threat that the vulnerabilities

129
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,479
themselves

130
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,680
so how do you think where you should put

131
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
the operating systems

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,759
on this list in terms of the priorities

133
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,880
across

134
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
based on that questions it is like a

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,080
first position

136
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
second third maybe other

137
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,919
so in terms of the number of

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,680
vulnerabilities

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
with the public exploits the operating

140
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,960
systems are

141
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,800
on the priority number 11. so

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
what is next

143
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
let's make it short what do you think

144
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,639
where you should put java java is known

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,919
to be vulnerable

146
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
java is known to have a prop to be

147
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
problematic in organizations

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
to be to be remediated because most of

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
the software

150
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,520
requires the specific version of it and

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
it's just like a

152
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
semi unmanageable but first

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
and foremost is not a biggest threat in

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,919
the organizations

155
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,080
and definitely it's not a low-hanging

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
fruit so

157
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,639
java is exactly in the middle

158
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,000
but i want to focus with you solely

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
on the top three how do you think

160
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
what type of software have a biggest

161
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,160
number of exploits

162
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,199
in majority of the organizations

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
and to to make it precise i want to

164
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,759
mention that

165
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
we are calculating also by volumes i

166
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,960
mean

167
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
by numbers of instances on how many

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
machines

169
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,039
on how many workstations on how many

170
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,400
servers on

171
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
how many devices we have this type of

172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
software installed

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
so the number one

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
is my favorite adobe products it's a

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
flash it's out of the reader

176
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
so and this is then this is the low

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
hanging fruit because

178
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
in most of the cases we need not a

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
specific version like

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
java but we need the last most updated

181
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,479
latest

182
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,120
version and in some of the cases we

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,080
don't need at

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
all let's say adobe flash so why not to

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,560
remove it

186
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,000
and okay but let's focus on

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,280
the list of the type of software's

188
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
with which have consists at the most

189
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,919
amount of the molarbits

190
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
number two what do you think it's a

191
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,479
internet browsers

192
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
it's a chrome firefox internet explorer

193
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,759
and

194
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
many others but those three are the most

195
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,039
popular

196
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,160
so there those are also low-hanging

197
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,199
fruits so

198
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
it is very easy to remedy that also

199
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
despite the threat is biggest because

200
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,800
in most cases once again we need the

201
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,360
most

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
current version of it so

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
my favorite point on this list is point

204
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,800
number three

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,840
so once again we are calculating the

206
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,039
vulnerabilities

207
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,919
which are calculated and multiplied by

208
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,039
the volume

209
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,520
on on how many machines on how many

210
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,560
assets

211
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
this threat these vulnerabilities and

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,759
thus

213
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,319
vulnerabilities which consist consists

214
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,879
can be detonated by the public exploits

215
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,320
are present and this area

216
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,080
is virtually in or

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,039
area the software is virtually on every

218
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,679
machine

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,320
in you in your organizations do you have

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
a clue

221
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
it's a intel graphics card drivers

222
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,440
because intel graphic card

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,240
chipset is installed in virtually every

224
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
workstation in the organization

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
in most cases what's moreover

226
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
most of the servers also consists the

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
very same graphic chipset

228
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
so the question is how many companies

229
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,320
are actively

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,279
tracking and remediating vulnerabilities

231
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,160
regarding

232
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
the drivers for the graphic cards which

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,720
are vulnerable

234
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,160
which are vulnerable with the

235
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
vulnerabilities with the public exploits

236
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
and can be easily detonated and the

237
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,000
environment

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
can be easily uh compromised

239
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
based on that so that's my favorite part

240
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,640
out of this game so

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,519
once again why is happening like that

242
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,160
why the situation is so

243
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,440
let's say scary of course

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,560
we have a very complex environments

245
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,000
we have multiple hybrid

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,800
architecture in our organizations we

247
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,519
have a

248
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
networks virtual machines physical

249
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,800
machines

250
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,360
we have a databases we have a storage we

251
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,399
have a containers

252
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
we have a collocated data centers in

253
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:03,839
various

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,680
environments we have a multiple

255
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
locations remote offices we have a

256
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
tons of people working at home at this

257
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,959
very moment which is also a complex

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,839
situation

259
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
we have a cloud solutions that you

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,040
gradually

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,920
being implemented in the organizations

262
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
we have a mobile

263
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,880
workforce and so on but most

264
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,800
threats in here is also

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
that because we are cutting off

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
some entire domains

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
because of the cost reducing and we are

268
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,760
cutting out the visibility

269
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,040
we are cutting out the ability to manage

270
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,399
vulnerabilities or

271
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,200
at least to see them through the volumes

272
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
because the process is not capable

273
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
okay capable to digest them

274
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
in the in these areas so how to solve

275
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
that situation first we need to grow

276
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,279
sensors to respective

277
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
areas we are not scanning we are

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
detecting

279
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
by the sensors by the container the

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
connectors with by the cloud connectors

281
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,320
and so on

282
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
so we don't need to spend the time for

283
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
detection itself because detections

284
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,360
detections are being

285
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,399
in real time and all changes are being

286
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
reported to the platform

287
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
without consuming the resources of the

288
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,160
machine

289
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,240
so while we have it we can create

290
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
the proper vulnerability management

291
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
lifecycle

292
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,120
and this what we call we call it

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
the real-time vulnerability management

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,279
so

295
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,800
first we need to have an asset inventory

296
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
so this is the funny question is always

297
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
uh

298
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
being asked in this moment that some of

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,680
the companies have a

300
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,680
cmdb database and the second question is

301
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
how many of those companies have a fully

302
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
updated updated

303
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,399
and fully managed data in the cmdb

304
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,600
well it's doable for here

305
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
while we have asset inventory where we

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,720
see all

307
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,079
assets in the environments in the

308
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,040
different

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
environments we can do the vulnerability

310
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,079
management on them we can assess the

311
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,600
vulnerabilities

312
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
that's the very moment that most of the

313
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,880
companies

314
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,839
are dying they are cutting off the asset

315
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,880
elementary

316
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,800
to shape the flow and the volume

317
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
of the vulnerability on the on the

318
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,720
vulnerabilities

319
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,639
in vulnerability management to be

320
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,000
capable

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
to manage them well okay but not okay

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
the crucial point is to

323
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,600
prioritize them and to assess them

324
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
from the risk perspective and i will

325
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
show you that in a moment

326
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,320
uh to be able to manage across the

327
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
priorities and i'm not saying the parity

328
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
in terms of let's say severity five

329
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
because all severity fives and uh are

330
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,279
equally important but some of them

331
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,760
are exploitable some of them are not

332
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
patchable

333
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
some of them are hitting for the end of

334
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
life and of support

335
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
uh type of software machines and so on

336
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,399
so this

337
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
requires different approach different

338
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
price and so on

339
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
but we have one block

340
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,880
missing in in this picture so

341
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,480
we need a consistent remediation

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,000
in that embedded in one solution because

343
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,880
if we are

344
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
splitting up in the pointed solutions we

345
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,839
are losing the track we are losing the

346
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,000
price we are losing the velocity

347
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,199
that be able to manage that efficiently

348
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,360
so how to achieve that as i said

349
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
to deploy the different sensors to the

350
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,480
different needs

351
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,079
of the companies it's a crucial part

352
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,519
but after that we

353
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
may have the real time

354
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,399
view so first

355
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
what we have on the screen this is what

356
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,760
i called the epicenter

357
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
of the of the solution this is epicenter

358
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,440
that actually from this very point

359
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,560
we can manage the priorities

360
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,760
and we can manage and speed up and

361
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,399
automate

362
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
the velocity that we are pacing with a

363
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,079
uh

364
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,160
with a vulnerabilities so based on that

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
let's focus

366
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,639
on the windows workstations based on

367
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,199
that

368
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
we have and one 401

369
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,760
based on that we have more than

370
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,199
one hundred thousand of vulnerabilities

371
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,480
and i'm saying

372
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
solely about the confirmed

373
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,279
vulnerabilities

374
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
you see the breakdown that the criticals

375
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000
and highs are the vast majority of them

376
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,920
but to be able to prioritize that

377
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,079
ipad i put the real-time threat

378
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,040
indicators

379
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,160
at the eyes based on that to filter out

380
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,760
which i think at this very moment

381
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
the most important of course it can be a

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
public exploit it can be

383
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,560
any type you want to focus on at this

384
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,600
very moment

385
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,399
i selected four of them which of the

386
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
vulnerabilities consist the malware

387
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,959
which of course vulnerabilities are

388
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,320
world mobile

389
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,120
which of the vulnerabilities are prone

390
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
to be active attacks

391
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,839
and consists of active kit based on that

392
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,839
rti based on that real-time threat

393
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,600
indicator which i can

394
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
change dynamically in i can get

395
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,519
results in a few seconds because if i

396
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,639
will change it

397
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
i will get the new results recalculated

398
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
in couple of seconds

399
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,360
of course i have also breakdown in terms

400
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,800
of the dates because i have

401
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,839
automated information how old the

402
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,880
vulnerabilities

403
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,920
are and i can focus also through this

404
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
perspective to them based on that

405
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
based on that filters i applied here i

406
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
get the picture that actually 98 over

407
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
98 of the vulnerability

408
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
machines are still vulnerable okay that

409
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,560
means that the

410
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,920
almost all but i have out

411
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,600
of over 100 000 of vulnerabilities

412
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,720
through this focus to this

413
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
prioritization i have 18 000 of them and

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,880
actually because i have a big number of

415
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
uh

416
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,279
assets they are only

417
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,480
352 unique

418
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,040
vulnerabilities that i want to focus in

419
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
the first

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
place which actually is

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
less than eighty percent of the total

422
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,720
scope

423
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,839
and this percentage is very important to

424
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
so-called dialects that i will be

425
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
focusing in a moment but the most

426
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
important from this screen

427
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,079
is that i can close the process as you

428
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
probably remember from the asset

429
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,679
inventory through the vulnerability

430
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,760
management to the prioritization

431
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,599
to the remediation so one

432
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,240
place that i click it like that i can

433
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,119
click it

434
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,839
is that i can touch them now actually

435
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,880
it's just not like a

436
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
i will push that button and the patches

437
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,919
will be installed of course

438
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
it's a part of the process that you can

439
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,000
manage them

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
in automated way in volumes

441
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,919
but according to your process you can

442
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,000
create the patch job

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,120
according to your schedule

444
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
is it like a regular maintenance window

445
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
which will be let's say as a patch

446
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
tuesday is an

447
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,039
an emergency patching that you need to

448
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
deploy as fast as possible

449
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
you may have the situation that you have

450
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
at hook packaging

451
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,760
like internet browsers like graphic card

452
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,640
drivers

453
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,760
like adobe readers and so on

454
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,640
so based on that you can create a job

455
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:10,960
that

456
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
actually will be safe and stored

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,640
in qualis and can be enabled

458
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,919
by the admin responsible by the part of

459
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,320
the environment because this job will be

460
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
will be targeted to their master to his

461
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
or her machines

462
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
and this will be exactly the same

463
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,280
that admin is doing that manually the

464
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
difference will be

465
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
that the contacts will be prepared the

466
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
purchase will be prepared the patches

467
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,799
will be downloaded

468
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,960
and the purchase will be ready to deploy

469
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,840
directly

470
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
in this platform so you don't need

471
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,880
external tools

472
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
actually to manage that

473
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,600
well speaking of so how do you think

474
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,160
what would be the best time to remediate

475
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,760
you can imagine based on the real-time

476
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
threat management or real-time

477
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,559
vulnerability management and i need to

478
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,840
mention here

479
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,360
that i'm using the ttr not an entity or

480
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
the mean time to resolution

481
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,320
because if we have a resolution time

482
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,200
for us as average we we may have the

483
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
vast of majority and white majority of

484
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,320
the

485
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,960
vulnerabilities covered very quickly but

486
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,160
some of them

487
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,200
will stay obsolete for a very very

488
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,360
long period of time that's why i'm using

489
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,760
the real time to remediate

490
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,720
and how do you think what would be the

491
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,520
best

492
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,720
what will be the best time to remediate

493
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
well it's zero in moment

494
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
that you see the vulnerability you may

495
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,840
have

496
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,200
ability to remediate that

497
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,480
almost instantly well

498
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,039
and speak you hope so i have a bonus for

499
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,080
you

500
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,880
i have a i was mentioning about the

501
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
dialects of the cyber security so

502
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,439
let me cover that let me cover

503
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,520
how to drag the attention

504
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,400
of those which have been presented on

505
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,120
the very

506
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,559
first slide from joe vest

507
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,919
those which actually are

508
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,240
making an end let's say ultimate

509
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
decisions

510
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,480
in the every organization

511
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
because they are in charge of releasing

512
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,200
the budget they are charged

513
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,400
of accepting or let's say

514
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
addressing the risks based on the

515
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,880
cyber security so let's play with that

516
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,240
we have basically three options most of

517
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
the companies

518
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,000
react like that that's my favorite

519
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,039
example most of you

520
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,080
recall that organization and most of you

521
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
recall that okay that organization was

522
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
was a let's say a victim

523
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
of a non-patient attack which happened

524
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
some time ago

525
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,760
and this company actually

526
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
this screen this this yellow green or

527
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,360
blue

528
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
screen then that the i.t systems are

529
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,400
down as the

530
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
direct screenshot from the main page of

531
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,400
this company

532
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
that actually there went to home because

533
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,039
everything went down this company

534
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,919
was like a this this breakdown was the

535
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,799
effect

536
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,320
of the two areas first

537
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,200
they had a branch office in the ukraine

538
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,480
ukraine

539
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,559
and unfortunately the non-petty attack

540
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,200
was

541
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,320
targeted to that country based on that

542
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,799
the second it's a fact of a factor of

543
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,919
disaster

544
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,039
was that the top management

545
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,159
decided to not to invest

546
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,440
in the cyber security because we are not

547
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
the bank

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
or whatever the decision were what there

549
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,799
was but the outcome

550
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,320
was quite quite serious they went

551
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,440
completely down they went into the

552
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,400
severe problems and very costly problems

553
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,679
across globally across the global global

554
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,559
structure

555
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,480
i have more examples of that and more

556
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,919
more companies but we don't have the

557
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,720
time space

558
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
to present them some of the situations

559
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,760
were

560
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,960
were quite funny but nevertheless

561
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
having the automated vulnerability

562
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,039
solution

563
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,080
can save a lot of money and actually

564
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
this very company is a very good

565
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
customer now

566
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,960
with a fraction of the money that i lost

567
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,640
by the previous decisions well

568
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
option number two we have a manual mold

569
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,919
and this is the most favorite

570
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,120
most common situation in the com

571
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,000
situation in companies i i'm observing

572
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
well

573
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
are you familiar with that are you

574
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,039
familiar with the excel file

575
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,159
comma separated file xml file

576
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,679
any flat file that is an outcome of the

577
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,039
regular classic approach a regular scan

578
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,919
the appliance scan the scanner that

579
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,559
actually

580
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,240
showing back the information about the

581
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,559
vulnerabilities well

582
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,679
we can change this view

583
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,480
to the table we have a severity five in

584
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,520
this number

585
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
we have a severity four in this number

586
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,799
etc and

587
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,799
still i'm playing with the only

588
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
confirmative liabilities i'm

589
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,039
showing away the potential one to make

590
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,000
this

591
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,320
view more clear and going further

592
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,039
we have a view like that is it

593
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,799
manageable

594
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
we have those parts percentage we have

595
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,360
had those

596
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
numbers in the company how we can

597
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,679
focus on the vulnerabilities that

598
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,279
actually are manageable

599
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,159
which of them are exploitable which of

600
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,120
which of those

601
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,640
are have a let's say exploit kits are

602
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,919
able to um to steal our data

603
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,799
uh have a very high lateral movement etc

604
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,520
and so on

605
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
we don't have a contact with that and

606
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,640
the

607
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,600
outcome of it with this manual mode is

608
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
that even though

609
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
we are reporting that to the executives

610
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,000
as this report let's say as an example

611
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
we still have a flat line

612
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,760
so the new flow of the vulnerability is

613
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
overpassing our successes

614
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
of remediation so our risk is still

615
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,559
the same we are not coping

616
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,120
with the flow of the muller rpds so

617
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,320
we are giving out the space and

618
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
the last option the proactive mode

619
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
let me show you that this way most of

620
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,159
you

621
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,799
most likely remember 2017 when the

622
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,559
wannacry

623
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,080
breach has materialized

624
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,200
so instead in some of the companies

625
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,320
the executive executives were asking

626
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,679
how is standing across this

627
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,840
vulnerability i remember one of the

628
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,720
company that

629
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
actually had to scan against this

630
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,960
particular vulnerability

631
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,320
uh especially

632
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
across entire organizations in every

633
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
country they had a branch

634
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,480
well that was a gruesome

635
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,279
task while you have detections you have

636
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,880
this information

637
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,600
at hand it can be any vulnerability you

638
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,480
may ask

639
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,080
that you will get the dashboard similar

640
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,520
to this

641
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,120
well speaking of so i want to

642
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,919
focus on the two types let's make it

643
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,400
bigger

644
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,760
a bit okay i want to focus

645
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,640
on the thread indicators i was showing

646
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,200
you

647
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,559
previously on the epicenter slide i want

648
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,559
to show

649
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,679
those two the patch the

650
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
vulnerabilities or assets on which

651
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,000
have uh have the unpatchable

652
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,120
vulnerabilities

653
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,760
because most likely they are out of date

654
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
end of life and of support

655
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,320
and the second one with the assets with

656
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
the potentially

657
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,960
high data loss vulnerabilities and i

658
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,200
want to put a thesis in here

659
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,000
if you will agree with me if i will say

660
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
if there will be

661
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,919
any type of successful data breach in

662
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,120
the company

663
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
and there is a most likely that during

664
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
that breach

665
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,840
the personal data will be stolen along

666
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,679
so i hope that you agree with me on that

667
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,720
because

668
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
i want to show you the example based on

669
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
that

670
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,279
let's say statement and

671
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
let's go to the details the unpatchable

672
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,679
vulnerabilities

673
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
well as you can see most of them are end

674
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
of life

675
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,039
but low hanging fruits we have adobe

676
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,000
flash player

677
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,039
we have app apple quicktime

678
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,000
which is actually rca a renewal mode

679
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
code execution type of vulnerability

680
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,679
we have many others which are like a low

681
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,640
hanging fruits like

682
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,679
internet explorer and so on

683
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
so we can focus on them and instead of

684
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
looking on them which are actually not

685
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,919
patchable we can remove them

686
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,159
in automated way and install the new

687
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,120
version if we need them

688
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,000
or simply remove because you can act you

689
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,960
can ask the as

690
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
a let's say a question if

691
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,840
i need a apple quicktime on my machines

692
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,399
you can track for a big bitcoin miners

693
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
and check if they are yours or not

694
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,600
others

695
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,120
for example and the second area

696
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
the assets with the potentially high

697
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,279
data loss vulnerabilities

698
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,600
in the very same way as you can see the

699
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,320
most and

700
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,559
foremost vulnerabilities that there are

701
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,919
in this

702
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,679
area are related to my favorites

703
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,960
regarding adobe flash player

704
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
adobe reader and so on as you can see

705
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,559
there's even the cisco webex extension

706
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,520
which is also vulnerable and may lead to

707
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,320
data leak

708
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
of course you can read across the cve

709
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,840
and you will get the details but

710
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,399
everything is interactive in here but i

711
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,360
want to focus

712
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,919
on the dialect going from that because

713
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
this view is highly

714
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,720
technical and this is highly let's say

715
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,020
geek for the management and completely

716
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,600
[Music]

717
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,039
let's say not clear what you may want

718
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,799
to uh pass what information i want to

719
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,080
give

720
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,399
based on that but i want to focus on the

721
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,000
percentage here

722
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,039
and i'm calling that gdpr infrastructure

723
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,679
compliance because of the data loss

724
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,320
potential data loss that we may have

725
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,240
and speaking of so

726
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
most of the companies are reacting like

727
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
that if i'm mentioning

728
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,520
or anyone is mentioning about the gdpr

729
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
but let's try

730
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,039
let's give a shot this

731
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,320
is how i perceive gdpr in most of the

732
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,120
cases

733
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,960
any any any any uh let's say

734
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,120
comprehensive uh presentation i've seen

735
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
about the gdpr itself

736
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
is consisting multiple angles some of

737
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
the companies are focusing on the legal

738
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
constraints and actually they are adding

739
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
the quotes into the

740
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,120
context and they are safe well

741
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,159
that's the question are we treating

742
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,480
the gdpr seriously but actually we can

743
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,000
put anything

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
on top of that it don't need to be a

745
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,840
gdpr it can be

746
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
the adobe readers internet drivers

747
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
whatever the the ability to

748
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,480
to uh

749
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,679
to compromise the end point through the

750
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,039
mail to the browser

751
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,600
through anything which is actually the

752
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
most common and most successful attack

753
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,320
vectors

754
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,640
but i want you to ask the question

755
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,440
this question in case of a real data

756
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
breach

757
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,559
how do you think who will be fired first

758
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,480
the top executives that actually made

759
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,960
the decision to do nothing about that

760
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,000
or the security specialists

761
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,760
or i.t specialists that actually

762
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,120
well were not able to report

763
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,120
that report it in the first hand

764
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,480
so i know the question to that actually

765
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,600
i've seen that on my

766
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,080
on my very own eyes several times it was

767
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,200
quite painful

768
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,440
and believe me it was not the executives

769
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,559
so let me present the example this is a

770
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,519
lot of text but

771
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,880
i want to focus on the

772
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,399
concept this is a detailed gdpr report

773
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,399
based on the policy compliance based on

774
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,440
the

775
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,720
good practices based on the iso 27001

776
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
and and this is top 20 critical security

777
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,640
controls

778
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,200
across that because we have a map in

779
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,120
between the articles in between the

780
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
resolutions

781
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,440
and and those good practices because the

782
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
map exists

783
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,279
so we can calculate that in in automated

784
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,679
way

785
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,840
i can make a breakdown in the

786
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,200
consolidated

787
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,279
mandate posture in the mandate posture

788
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,039
breakdown etc blah blah blah

789
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,039
whatever it is inside but i want to

790
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,960
focus on the one thing

791
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
on the left side i'm using the good

792
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,240
standards

793
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,039
good standards that actually bring us to

794
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,600
the

795
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,960
due diligence that is like a we cannot

796
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,000
negotiate

797
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
with the good standards because they are

798
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,320
there they are globally acclaimed

799
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,159
like iso 2701 these benchmarks

800
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,960
like uh microsoft hardening standards

801
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
and so on

802
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
and this is the second point

803
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
that i wanted to show you i don't want

804
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,480
to show the

805
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,039
entire report it is not important i want

806
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,159
to present

807
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,760
the compliance level is actually 46

808
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,039
percent

809
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,679
do you remember the yellow one from from

810
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,679
the technical perspective

811
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,600
that one is from the policy compliance

812
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,720
perspective

813
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,279
so my dialect and my answer

814
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,559
to the executives is like that which is

815
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,320
automated because i'm calculating that

816
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
on daily basis

817
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,640
in automated way this is

818
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,720
how compliant we are and how far

819
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,840
in the reality we are

820
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,440
from the perception of the compliance of

821
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,799
the top management

822
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,080
and this can be easily transferred

823
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,480
transformed into the risk into the

824
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,600
operational risk that you can put along

825
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,840
with a financial

826
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,399
reputation like a finance reputation

827
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,080
and legal threats or risks in the

828
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
organization

829
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,240
this is a fact we cannot challenge the

830
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,960
facts

831
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,840
but we can make actions on them the top

832
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,720
management

833
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,840
may want or may not want

834
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,039
to act on that but still

835
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,760
we are protecting the environment by

836
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,200
presenting the risks

837
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,960
in the approach appropriate

838
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,000
dialect those numbers are easily

839
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
they are very easy to understand by the

840
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,000
top management

841
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,520
they can do educated actions based on

842
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
that

843
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,079
they cannot do this on the

844
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,719
exploitable severity 5 remote code

845
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,520
execution

846
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,719
vulnerability on the whatever it is

847
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
inside

848
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
but there focus on that and you can

849
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,440
build that

850
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,839
i i gave the example of the gdpr but

851
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,839
actually you may have

852
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,679
any type of uh

853
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,280
of the problem you may exist in the

854
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,159
organization

855
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
like end of life and of support systems

856
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,159
you may say

857
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,280
that 51

858
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,599
of your environment is unmanageable

859
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,480
because of end of life you cannot update

860
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
the systems

861
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,440
you need to build a project for

862
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,720
migration

863
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,760
to another version

864
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,599
so based on that

865
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,720
you want to achieve one thing

866
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,359
you want to achieve a situation when you

867
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,480
will see

868
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,760
the vulnerabilities across the entire

869
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,839
environment not this 12 percent we

870
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,200
started from

871
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,920
not from the any other numbers you want

872
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
to see them all

873
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,520
at once but you will be able to manage

874
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
them

875
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
all at once and converting them to the

876
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,839
risks

877
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,200
that actually top management those

878
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,000
c-level executives will be able to

879
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,680
understand

880
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,880
in their dialect and make actions on

881
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,520
that

882
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,440
because the risk will be theirs

883
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,640
the actions will be theirs either is a

884
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,760
patching process

885
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,560
if existing if possible if there is a

886
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,560
active let's say migration needed

887
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
from that i don't know windows server

888
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
2012 to the windows

889
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,440
server 2016 from the sql 2005 to the

890
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,640
newer version and so on whatever it is

891
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,560
you may want to achieve this by

892
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,440
creating the background like a baseline

893
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
for the top management

894
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,079
to actually to understand what they need

895
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,119
to invest

896
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,720
to actually to make it happen because

897
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
otherwise they will say okay

898
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,599
i have i t security guy i have an id guy

899
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,839
i it's not my problem it's not my risk

900
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,920
but when you will pose that when you

901
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,119
present that

902
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,839
in the form of the risk not the

903
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,280
vulnerability

904
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,920
you'll drag the attention the

905
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,520
prerequisite is

906
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,000
that you need to see all visible all

907
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,440
vulnerabilities

908
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,560
but to convert them not like a

909
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,200
10 000 pages uh report

910
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,640
but to the one comprehensive percentage

911
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,560
number and that's the area i want you

912
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,240
to guide so this is it

913
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,560
that's all from my site thank you very

914
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,839
much

915
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,200
for for your time and i'm open

916
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,640
to your questions thank you
