[Applause]

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,678
it's even better and bigger than last

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,230
year I think and the years before even I

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,910
was missing a conference like this 10

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,920
years ago in other countries and I'm

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,080
very happy to be here in Budapest and

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,689
that activity is right here because I

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,619
see so many people so many young people

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,439
with skills and expertise and also fun

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:33,360
and working in the IT security sector so

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,309
it's really enjoyable to come here I'm

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,530
impatient about activity has been

13
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,709
generally very good because it has been

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,120
well organized they most favorite thing

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,100
about activities that it actually

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,879
brought together speakers from different

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,399
countries it's always important because

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,949
that way you get to get out of your

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,010
local pool of knowledge and bring

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,260
impressions and experiences and

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,170
generally no village from face of the

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,608
world in the end of the day our

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,129
experiences are very very similar in the

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:12,040
States we face

25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:12,040
[Music]

26
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,820
what I like the most of the activity

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,910
conference I think is the high level of

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,070
talks and the diversity we just came out

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,770
of a social engineering talk and then we

30
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,020
had disabling into a management engine

31
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,330
which is super technical super low level

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,509
and I think that the wide range of talks

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,039
is just fascinating and it opens you up

34
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,430
to a much larger problem

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,869
[Music]

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,869
activity this year has been absolutely a

37
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,790
wonderful treat to be a part of the

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,009
amazing quality of the talks like

39
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,500
Casilla kaki this morning this morning

40
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,330
we have seen great talks yesterday about

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,110
banking and breaking into banks and

42
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,720
things like that

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,810
SCADA systems there has been no shortage

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,548
of great content here and the benefit of

45
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,080
being in a city like Budapest is

46
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,670
absolutely wonderful especially when you

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,490
have 20 degrees Celsius weather and

48
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,510
being Canadian we enjoy it when it's

49
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:22,560
actually one

50
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:22,840
[Music]

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:34,320
