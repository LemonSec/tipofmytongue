1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,770
so let's get started with this talk for

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,899
those of you that weren't here yesterday

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,889
for my talk let me give a quick

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,750
introduction I'm the CTO at my own

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,529
independent cybersecurity research

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,600
company zero IT lab I'm also a member at

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,300
Budapest University of Technology's

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,710
crisis lab and our CTF team core dump

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,980
personally I do a lot of reverse

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,120
engineering work it's the domain and

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,489
which I'm the most active for sure this

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,328
is my title for the describe your job

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,879
poorly contest I love to open expensive

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,120
calculators and today I finally get to

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,309
show one of those expensive calculators

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,050
I mentioned our CTF team for those of

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,019
you that aren't familiar with capture

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,739
the flags they're a very hands-on way of

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,830
learning IT security and practicing your

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,830
skills so hugely recommended for anyone

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,759
who likes to learn about this sort of

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,380
stuff so let's get started with our

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,130
material for today cyber security

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,520
challenges and risks

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,149
whenever I'm thinking of a risk and IT

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,509
security the two factors I'm definitely

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,750
considering are the likeliness of a

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,970
vulnerability being exploited and the

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,689
impact you know what's the consequence

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,670
when something gets exploited those are

31
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,179
the two main sectors I tend to think of

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:46,439
when it comes to risk but what type of

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,930
risk are we considering really I like to

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,699
list these four categories of risk so

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:58,560
I'm sure they're mostly self-explanatory

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,049
at this point the one of these four that

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,469
interests me the most is technological

38
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:08,479
vulnerabilities inherent suffer

39
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:11,008
obviously it's a very broad area so

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,709
there's a lot of research and activity

41
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:17,290
there

42
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:19,750
I think this this one's the one with the

43
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,959
most technical depth compared to you to

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:26,099
the other three so I'll talk a bit about

45
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,400
how organisations and businesses can

46
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:34,589
manage their risk in this fourth area

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,510
technological vulnerabilities so

48
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,969
whenever you're thinking of managing the

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,599
risk penetration testing is a practice

50
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:46,358
that may come to your mind it's pretty

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,099
much an industry standard thing to do I

52
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:50,919
don't think I need to introduce this

53
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,480
practice to any of you right but I don't

54
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,879
think there's a lot of discussion around

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,810
how you're supposed to do penetration

56
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,149
testing and how you can actually do it

57
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,489
correctly and get the most value out of

58
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,280
your time and investment so that's the

59
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:11,049
first thing I want to talk to you a bit

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:14,439
about today so during my experience in

61
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:16,569
the industry I've often seen basically

62
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,019
the fact that's an organization just

63
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:23,078
wants to get through an audit basically

64
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:25,750
take all the check boxes make sure no

65
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,909
one's coming after them for you know I

66
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,650
was getting some other things thing done

67
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:33,370
and they just want to get on with their

68
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:38,290
business so that's a type of ground

69
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:41,859
security that I think is common so it's

70
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,228
very important to consider when you're

71
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,419
thinking of penetration testing is this

72
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:52,030
something I really want or is this just

73
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:54,729
another checkbox on my list so once you

74
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,019
decide if you really need a real word

75
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,209
hacking

76
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:02,470
you have a first starting point for

77
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:04,989
choosing your theme for the test and you

78
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,220
know thinking about the other factors

79
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,870
that go into that choice so the obvious

80
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,989
next question is how do you choose a

81
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,759
theme for penetration testing right you

82
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,820
might think okay I want someone who's

83
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:22,120
really competent who knows their craft

84
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,040
who is going to find the most vulnerable

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:30,680
it is possible maybe you can look at

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,840
Trek record right but on the other hand

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,200
choosing a team is very often a

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,960
compromise between price and competence

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:43,250
you can get a really good team for a

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:47,900
high price not necessarily all teams

91
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:50,840
that cost a lot of money are good so you

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,560
have to have a budget if you want to get

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:59,419
a chance a remote chance at even getting

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,760
someone competent so like I said not

95
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,090
everyone who charges a lot is good but

96
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,349
you're very unlikely to get someone who

97
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:12,400
is good for well a really small amount

98
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,350
of money I mean of course this is

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,010
relative in each case and specific to

100
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,820
that system but in any case I think

101
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:27,650
that's something you should keep in mind

102
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:31,400
also during my my years in the industry

103
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:34,219
I've often had this conversation when

104
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,469
someone would want you to you find all

105
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,350
the vulnerabilities possible in their

106
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,950
system and they would want you to do

107
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:46,190
this with 0% chance of creating

108
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,289
denial-of-service in their system and I

109
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,260
have to tell you this is the magical

110
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,230
unicorn that doesn't exist if you want

111
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,740
to get tests it might go down that's how

112
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,270
it works

113
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:02,000
so if you want get testing make sure

114
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,099
your environment is suitable for the

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,600
conditions that are required for good

116
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,420
testing so I'm mentioning this because

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,350
if someone a penetration tester comes in

118
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:18,680
and promises you any of these things you

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,870
can already suspect that they're sort of

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:27,110
 they cannot promise you any of

121
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:28,610
these so keep an eye on that so let's

122
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,230
say you eventually get a penetration

123
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,650
testing team to look at one of your

124
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,780
products or services right make sure

125
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,000
that they actually have what they need

126
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,929
to work right

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,810
so like I said these options of like not

128
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,639
having an actual testing environment or

129
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,210
saying that denial-of-service is an

130
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,909
option this is a very strong inhibitor

131
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,460
for good testing so if you actually

132
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:57,949
decide to spend money on penetration

133
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,930
testing make sure you get good value out

134
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:04,310
of it and provide the environment for

135
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,599
for the people to actually be able to do

136
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:10,879
their work and also issues often come up

137
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,550
during testing make sure to have

138
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:17,990
competent people on hand who are able to

139
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:20,990
assist the testers if you don't do any

140
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,120
of these obviously time is gonna go by

141
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,280
you'll pay for the penetration testing

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,500
with your burning your own money because

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,888
you're not getting adequate value out of

144
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:36,050
the testing so about the price a good

145
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:39,819
team like I said is always going to cost

146
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,620
you and you should not be trying to

147
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,680
minimize your costs on the expense of

148
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,930
getting a good penetration testing team

149
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,240
the way you make sure your testing is

150
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,150
efficient is by getting the highest

151
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,110
value out of a good team a good team

152
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,580
that's going to cost you money so with

153
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,789
the very first step that I would

154
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,139
recommend to anyone in terms of getting

155
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,409
good value out of their penetration

156
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,949
tests is make sure you choose the right

157
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,779
team and then of course each and every

158
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,930
time I recommend this from the other

159
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:18,289
side of the table comes a response how

160
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,719
would I know who's the right team of

161
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,969
course people who are not that technical

162
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:26,419
are the ones asking this question more

163
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:29,870
often but let me suggest a few ways in

164
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:34,309
which you can try to tackle this

165
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:39,880
question but before we do that I have to

166
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:42,559
warn you of a very common bias a

167
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,829
cognitive bias that people who choose

168
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,790
penetration testing teams may have which

169
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:49,699
is

170
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,620
that in a lot of organizations the

171
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,990
person who's in charge of choosing a

172
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,640
penetration testing team might be held

173
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:01,670
accountable not only for any issues that

174
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,069
may come up during the incident but also

175
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,680
for any future issues that may come up

176
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,440
after the test has been done you know

177
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,660
why haven't the team found this specific

178
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,060
issue or that issue like these sort of

179
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:19,100
discussions is what I really mean so

180
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,910
there's this bias from the people who

181
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,390
are choosing the penetration testers to

182
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:28,850
pick someone who has brand recognition

183
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,710
usually a multinational corporation or

184
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,920
advising company or advisors I mean

185
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,690
whose services are varying in quality I

186
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,140
mean I don't mean that specifically for

187
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,330
advisors but in general usually once you

188
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,020
have a really big company they move slow

189
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:51,440
and they might not have the specific

190
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,329
competence or the specific skill that

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,440
would be needed to efficiently

192
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,740
penetration tests your specific product

193
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,330
so you might turn to your certifications

194
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,460
well you would think it's a good thing

195
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:08,530
to choose someone who's certified right

196
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,530
it's literally what certificates are for

197
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,510
but instead of that let me suggest

198
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,300
alternative options that you may have

199
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:21,110
here's a few of them which are technical

200
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,959
and a few I mean one and a half it's not

201
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,700
technical obviously not everyone who's

202
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,320
going to choose a penetration testing

203
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,630
team is going to be a very technical

204
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,450
person so for those of you that aren't

205
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,420
the technical go with the non-technical

206
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,700
options so option one go actually meet

207
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,880
them meet the penetration testing team I

208
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:44,270
mean and not the c-level executives who

209
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,620
employ them but the actual team if you

210
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,990
have a chance if that's something

211
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,440
possible you should don't waste you you

212
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,050
know meet the team talk to them see how

213
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,610
good they are at their craft it's a

214
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,770
technical thing to do obviously it's a

215
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,540
technical assessment but if that's

216
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,360
something that you can do you should

217
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,510
definitely

218
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,600
the second option I have for you is both

219
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,280
technical and a bit non-technical

220
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,780
checking out their publications blogs

221
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:17,290
Twitter etc it's slightly technical

222
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,370
because if you have to judge their

223
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,260
publications or blogs which are often

224
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,540
technical materials you need some

225
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,370
technical skills but you can also look

226
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,020
at their reputation how they're

227
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,320
interacting with other people in the

228
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:34,220
industry that's a much less technical

229
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,650
thing and here's a an absolutely

230
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:41,120
non-technical way you can just check if

231
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:45,650
they're competing in CDF's if someone is

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,760
in the top 100 or top 50 on CTF time

233
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:51,560
it's not necessarily like a sure

234
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,510
indication of them being like excellent

235
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,969
at penetration testing but I think

236
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,069
there's a very strong correlation if the

237
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,070
area good at solving CTF problems

238
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,530
they're very likely good at thinking

239
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,090
outside the box which means they are

240
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,630
much more likely to be good penetration

241
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:12,770
testers and find the issues that are

242
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:16,490
hidden in your system back to

243
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:20,680
certifications a bit these are the ones

244
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:26,120
I've table defined in about two minutes

245
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:29,750
there's a lot of them right so are any

246
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:34,220
of its first your time are any of these

247
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,430
good for for choosing someone the answer

248
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,850
may surprise you

249
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:43,010
so as a tester or a researcher you can

250
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,290
spend all the money in the world on

251
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:49,010
these certificates and obviously they

252
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,560
cost your time and your efforts I'm

253
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,560
personally not a fan of this practice I

254
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,959
have friends who have a lot of these

255
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,880
certificates and we often discuss their

256
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,960
experience with acquiring these and

257
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,330
getting through the challenge courses

258
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,340
and one of the examples I got from them

259
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,370
is they had the red shell codes for

260
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,160
Windows Server 2000 to

261
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:18,999
yet they were asking me hey how does the

262
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,170
credential specs work on Linux which I

263
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:26,110
mean is a fair question but I would want

264
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:29,019
well known certificate to cover these

265
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:34,509
materials why are the course materials

266
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:38,019
throughout updates in some cases so the

267
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,879
conclusion I'm trying to get to as at

268
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:43,240
the end of the day holding these

269
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,889
certificates doesn't prove what you

270
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,589
should be really looking for in a

271
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:49,749
penetration tester any technical skill

272
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:53,490
beyond what's that specific certificate

273
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:56,800
discovering is largely unknown to you

274
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,170
just because someone has an OS CP or

275
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,959
whatever that doesn't tell you if they

276
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,439
are curious really about the industry if

277
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:08,258
they've got any insight into you

278
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:10,599
information security as a whole or if

279
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:13,930
they have the willingness or capacity to

280
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,999
adapt on the fly when something goes in

281
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:20,559
an unexpected way during a test and like

282
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:23,559
I mentioned before it also doesn't show

283
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:27,219
if they're capable of thinking outside

284
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:29,949
the box which is a very crucial skill so

285
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:35,319
I'm not trying to say that anyone who

286
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:37,149
has these certifications is not good at

287
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,729
the things listed I'm just saying that

288
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,999
the certificate doesn't prove these

289
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:47,290
things there may be a correlation

290
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:49,720
between the desired skills and having a

291
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,730
certification but correlation is not

292
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,730
causation and you should remember that

293
00:14:54,329 --> 00:15:03,699
so changing gears a bit I want to talk

294
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:05,679
about the public relations both from on

295
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:11,979
the public's and an organizational

296
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:15,730
perspective one value that's sort of

297
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,579
driving economy not only in the Western

298
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:22,329
world is the concept of maximizing

299
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:25,449
shareholder value it's really important

300
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,170
there's even legal precedent under eBay

301
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,969
versus new

302
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,430
where the law made it literal

303
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,769
malfeasance for a company not to do

304
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,339
everything it's legally able to you to

305
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:41,360
maximize its profits so this is going to

306
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:45,170
be our core starting point for our next

307
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:51,529
thoughts regarding the public relations

308
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:53,269
and how disclosures happen so with this

309
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:58,189
thought in mind maximizing shareholder

310
00:15:53,269 --> 00:16:03,910
value this pretty much means that if a

311
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:07,998
company is not legally required to you

312
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,370
disclose a vulnerability to you and they

313
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:12,829
understand that disclosing something is

314
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,100
going to have public backlash right

315
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:18,829
people are going to be raged out about

316
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,350
this vulnerability earlier that's

317
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:25,609
credential leak or whatever this means

318
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:29,600
that they know that their perception may

319
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,939
be their stock is at risk so with the

320
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,759
maximizing shareholder value concept in

321
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:37,969
mind they are definitely not going to

322
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:41,870
disclose the vulnerability if it's not

323
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,120
going to maximize shareholder value it's

324
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,449
kind of centrally but that's the reality

325
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,420
of it so I want to give a piece of

326
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:54,410
advice to consumers how do we create

327
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,589
good culture around disclosures well I

328
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:01,189
made a be outraged and the don't be

329
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:05,120
outraged list so that we can create good

330
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:08,059
culture around disclosures so here's my

331
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:12,049
please do not be outraged list if a

332
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:14,720
company is willingly deciding to share

333
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,760
information with you about any

334
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,980
vulnerability they had in their system

335
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,770
or service and they were not legally

336
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,349
required to disclose it to you make sure

337
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,299
to show your appreciation to them they

338
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,490
are doing the service to you that they

339
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:30,070
are not required to do it's a really

340
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,779
good thing

341
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,149
also you should remember unfortunately

342
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:37,640
software is I mean not all software

343
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,840
there's obviously varying degrees of

344
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,419
being

345
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,519
very often software is vulnerable and

346
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:46,639
you should not be expecting software to

347
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,679
be perfectly secure because it's

348
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:52,039
naturally a goal it's like fully

349
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,980
attainable today so instead I would

350
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,799
suggest that whenever a disclosure

351
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,350
happens you should judge the attitude of

352
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,480
the organization and the mitigation

353
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,320
response procedure that they've taken to

354
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,519
address whatever was being disclosed and

355
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,519
only the technological vulnerabilities

356
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:16,279
looking at their attitude and their

357
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,230
procedure tells you a lot more about how

358
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,710
they perceive this area and how mature

359
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:27,289
they are so I suggest looking at these

360
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:31,190
things first and only them judging the

361
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:35,119
actual vulnerability I hope it makes

362
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,899
sense but here's my please do be

363
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,549
outraged list you could be asking why

364
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:44,239
does it why does this make sense right

365
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:49,179
well I think customer pushback and

366
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:52,820
consumer pushback is what's essentially

367
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:56,690
forming how companies approach this area

368
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:00,889
so by giving feedback I mean maybe being

369
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,899
outraged it's a bit of an overstep but

370
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:06,619
you know actually giving constructive

371
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:09,049
feedback is going to influence this

372
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:12,499
culture in a good way so when a company

373
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:15,168
refuses to be transparent and refuses to

374
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:18,139
release information to you that concerns

375
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:20,149
you obviously maybe if your credentials

376
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:23,779
have been leaked or if their software

377
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:24,949
was vulnerable in a major way this is

378
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:27,529
something that you would want to know

379
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,139
about if they refuse to tell you make

380
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:32,629
sure you make yourself heard and give

381
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:34,369
them feedback about what's okay and

382
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,980
what's not

383
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:39,678
some companies take legal action against

384
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:43,669
security researchers make sure you tell

385
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,669
them this is don't do this and

386
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:48,399
then some companies when vulnerabilities

387
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:50,950
are found in their products and services

388
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:55,479
release ineffective

389
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,369
or defective fixes to the issues I'll

390
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,720
show you an example of how outrageous

391
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:03,759
this can get so once again get feedback

392
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,710
when it's appropriate

393
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,129
some companies operate with very

394
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,859
anti-competitive practices the triple e

395
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:14,049
stands for embrace extend extinguish if

396
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:16,928
you haven't heard of this we'll get up

397
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:20,559
some companies are still doing this

398
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:23,499
today both with your wallets done by

399
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,029
their offer those companies that

400
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:28,480
offer products that take away your

401
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:32,019
fundamental freedoms of computing in key

402
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,309
areas by which I mean networking gear

403
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:37,869
operating systems firmware that runs on

404
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,450
like the very hardware that you use

405
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:44,590
those are core areas where you should be

406
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:47,169
very strongly driving innovation towards

407
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,168
free software because free software and

408
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:51,820
ownership is what allows you to you

409
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:56,799
defend yourself and level the playing

410
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:58,869
field against often see vectors yeah

411
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,779
about fixes let me just show

412
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:05,279
you this one this was in one of Cisco's

413
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:09,549
products a researcher submitted a nephew

414
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:14,710
their proof of concept exploit used the

415
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:17,980
well-known application curl and their

416
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,769
fix our firmware update contain this

417
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,019
line of code in their nginx

418
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:26,049
configuration file and case you're not

419
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:29,499
familiar with the serv syntax the code

420
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:31,629
means if the user agent is curl meaning

421
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:34,119
the curl application is being used to

422
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:38,080
interact with this device this will

423
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:40,178
return an HTTP 403 instead of the site

424
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,460
so it literally just breaks the

425
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:46,059
proof-of-concept and doesn't fix any of

426
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,330
the issues that are revealed by the

427
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,950
exploit so I don't get how you can get

428
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,769
to the level of being a company like

429
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,259
Cisco and still afford to do this this

430
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:58,330
is not the right make sure you make

431
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:01,409
yourself heard you should not accept

432
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,408
this sort of behavior

433
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:09,000
okay once again let me change gears a

434
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:11,940
bit let's talk about bug bounties I'm a

435
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,920
bit conflicted on this it certainly has

436
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,160
its advantages and disadvantages

437
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,140
let's look at both right so some

438
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,710
companies basically try to minimize

439
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,600
their cost so whenever they were

440
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,600
thinking of like getting a penetration

441
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,419
testing team they can just yeah go to

442
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,639
your black male provider and be like hey

443
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,520
we're not going to pay for issues but

444
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,960
here's our program and you know sources

445
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,600
vulnerabilities so I mean this is

446
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,260
fortunately the exception rather than

447
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,959
the rule but as a researcher doing

448
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,560
background is can be a scam I'll

449
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,750
elaborate so what I mean is that if

450
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,030
you're not smart about it if you work

451
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,460
for the wrong people if you work for a

452
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:02,610
program that doesn't pay what your

453
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,970
vulnerabilities are worth that's an

454
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,030
issue

455
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:08,640
so don't work for people that don't

456
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:13,139
appreciate your work both with their

457
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,960
response times obviously the contents of

458
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,650
their response their attitude

459
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,130
I mean and of course and the financial

460
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:26,100
aspect as well they have to pay good

461
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,910
money for good vulnerabilities don't

462
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,909
sell yourself short

463
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,290
but if you're smart about doing buy

464
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,919
bonus you can get a really good return

465
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,750
on your investment so my advice is that

466
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,390
if you're looking to do bug bounties

467
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,800
make sure you're smart about it make

468
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:49,790
sure you work for the right people

469
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,790
otherwise you don't get a good return

470
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,320
so this opening slide sounded a bit

471
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,690
negative but don't get me wrong I love a

472
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,600
fair number of things about bug bounties

473
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,890
they do tremendous good in the world so

474
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,139
let me tell you about a few of those

475
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,880
surrenders to get things obviously are

476
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,490
directly sourcing vulnerability

477
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,010
information

478
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,370
to a vendor meaning they'll fix the

479
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:23,530
issue and users are not going to be

480
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:25,350
impacted it definitely provides a way of

481
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,809
life or a source of income for

482
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:31,090
freelancer researchers which is

483
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:34,000
something that fits some people's

484
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:37,870
lifestyles having an option like this is

485
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,210
shortly welcome it also paved the way

486
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:43,959
for the decriminalization of security

487
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,510
research obviously 10 or 20 years ago

488
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,790
we did not have this bug money culture

489
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:54,580
even in the West so by actually creating

490
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:58,030
these programs and accepting the

491
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,010
vulnerability information the bug bounty

492
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:04,470
platform's definitely created good

493
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,470
culture around responsible disclosure

494
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:12,580
like I mentioned for the first point

495
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,770
here through bug bounties a lot of bugs

496
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,990
get fixed before they would impact you

497
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,960
so it's definitely good for consumers

498
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:23,010
and their privacy and security there's

499
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:27,090
no doubt about that

500
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:29,260
in this slogan together we hit harder

501
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:33,309
comes from one of the bug bounty

502
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,590
platforms hacker one basically at the

503
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:38,170
argument being the knowledge is being

504
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:43,000
crowd first whoever is the most

505
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:46,630
competent and most well they have the

506
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,230
best craft in that specific area is able

507
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,630
to deliver value directly to you the

508
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,870
programs that are impacted by their

509
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,300
research or their specific craft so I

510
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,489
really like this thought because it only

511
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:05,800
takes one individual with a specific

512
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:11,410
skill to bring gigantic value to a much

513
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:13,419
larger crowd of people so these are my

514
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,390
my positive thoughts about bug bounties

515
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:18,600
they're hugely positive and in these

516
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,600
areas

517
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,170
let's look at this from an

518
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:27,010
organizational perspective when should

519
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,930
you do bug bounties let's say you're the

520
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,270
security manager for your organization

521
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,930
maybe you're thinking do we do bug

522
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:39,920
bounties when do we do them how do we do

523
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:41,770
them so my advice to you would be once

524
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,390
your product or service is mature enough

525
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,790
maybe it is underground undergone at

526
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,250
least one penetration test you should

527
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,100
always do bug bounties and then when I

528
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,890
tell this to people of course one of the

529
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,969
reactions I get is oh I don't have the

530
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:01,640
budget for this well you can start small

531
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,260
obviously if you don't pay right the

532
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,610
quality researchers are not going to

533
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:11,150
work for you but still even without the

534
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:13,790
top 5% or top 10% of researchers you can

535
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:17,210
still get very good value and very good

536
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:20,300
vulnerabilities so even if you're

537
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,760
starting out with a lower budget this is

538
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,649
worth doing but I have to warn you the

539
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,780
three things you have to get right if

540
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,180
you want to do a bug bounty as an

541
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:33,050
organization is defining your budget

542
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:36,290
make sure you know roughly how much you

543
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:39,230
can spend on this and define your scope

544
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:43,090
and the respective payouts such that

545
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:47,060
your budget is not going to be

546
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:49,550
inadequate for paying researchers and

547
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:53,510
also keep in mind that whenever you get

548
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:56,840
issues regarding your service you have

549
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,790
to allocate resources to fix this so

550
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,449
make sure that the people who are going

551
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:06,170
to triage the bugs are available to

552
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,570
triage them so if setting this up is not

553
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,300
in your core competence which is very

554
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,580
rarely the case for an organization get

555
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,250
external help I'll talk to you

556
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:19,520
researchers or companies like us because

557
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:26,120
we can help you define the right options

558
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:28,790
in these three areas so this was roughly

559
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,770
the main point I was trying to make for

560
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,720
an organization with those so here's the

561
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,299
warning

562
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,260
hacker culture release the immune system

563
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:38,799
of the Internet

564
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:41,710
good hackers protect everyone so respect

565
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,230
the culture and contributed by getting

566
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:48,299
those three things right and then be one

567
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:53,400
of those people you can see the colors

568
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:56,710
this seems like a hidden message right

569
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:01,960
this refers to telecom the Hungarian

570
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:08,020
telecom yes okay make sure we get this

571
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:10,299
right so let me tell you a hugely

572
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,490
impactful story in my life about bug

573
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:15,190
bounties hopefully I can give you some

574
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:20,409
insights into how valuable bug bounty is

575
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:24,130
when it's done right so right games is a

576
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:26,169
company founded in 2006 headquartered in

577
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,140
West LA and they are a video game

578
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:32,080
production and publishing company with I

579
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,030
think in 2018 they had 24 offices around

580
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,908
the globe and they're best known for

581
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:40,389
their hugely popular title League of

582
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:43,240
Legends and just recently they finally

583
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,669
bit the SM Riot Games by announcing a

584
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:51,460
range of new titles which I'm personally

585
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:54,640
very excited about as for player counts

586
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,309
or their popularity recent numbers are

587
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,049
harder to come by

588
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:04,149
but during my short research I was

589
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,650
definitely able to find references

590
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,500
saying they had over a hundred million

591
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:13,900
monthly active players in their platform

592
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:16,720
in 2016 and they're one of the more

593
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,690
transparent companies which had to fully

594
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,590
appreciate they have a tech blog on

595
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,770
which they realized an article in 2016

596
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,500
titled

597
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:29,559
running a bug bounty program and they

598
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,110
outlined five important points to you

599
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,280
how they want to debug monies and if you

600
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:38,080
look at them this largely covers what I

601
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,450
told you about how you should do bug

602
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,850
bounties fight together and not with the

603
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,789
researchers obviously make sure the

604
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:48,699
researchers are aborted and they feel

605
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:51,100
like part of your team after all you're

606
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,929
working for the same cause keep it

607
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,820
simple and stupid so that they

608
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,640
understand where your limits are and

609
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,070
value the researchers time by paying

610
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,020
them what their isrikuz worth that's how

611
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,049
you build a world-class program that

612
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:10,450
attracts the best people and they know

613
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:13,120
that too which is great so let me talk

614
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:16,270
to you a bit about how their product

615
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,809
verse League of Legends as their main

616
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:22,750
title and it's powered by a piece of

617
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:25,000
software called elite client also very

618
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,649
often referred to as LCU which stands

619
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,970
for late client update because it's

620
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:33,850
their rebirth client whatever this piece

621
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:36,520
of software mainly works using two

622
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:40,000
processes one of them is a C++ based

623
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:43,539
hosting engine that sort of hosts micro

624
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,730
services in this back-end process and

625
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:48,669
they're available through a restful api

626
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:52,559
that is provided over https locally and

627
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:56,409
this c++ based back and process spawns

628
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,678
sort of front end process titled ux

629
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:01,720
which is a chromium based browser

630
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,679
essentially and this browser process is

631
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,669
pointed at the backend process and that

632
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:11,740
restful api is what serves all the

633
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:14,770
requests and does the fancy back in

634
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:19,210
processing so they can focus on building

635
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:23,080
the front end using html5 and javascript

636
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:25,899
and you know the usual stuff on both the

637
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,470
back and the front process is powered by

638
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:32,260
a plug-in system so every component that

639
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,179
appears in your screen or that presents

640
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,429
themselves as a micro service as an

641
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:40,030
individual module or a plug-in in their

642
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:44,919
system this is how their client looks

643
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:48,908
like this is a bunch of plugins working

644
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:53,260
together so you get really put together

645
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:55,420
great looking experience with the added

646
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,900
benefit and modularity

647
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:03,220
their plug-in system it's a good design

648
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:05,380
I think this is how they visual ID the

649
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,930
serve like plug-in system and their

650
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,150
ecosystem so they're saying there's a

651
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:12,760
right data center which runs it runs

652
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,600
their our platform code they connect to

653
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:19,870
that using a protocol called rtmp and

654
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,490
the rtmp client is actually the C++

655
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,639
micro service part and the backend

656
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:27,730
process and the backend plugins are what

657
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,040
are essentially offering this piece of

658
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:34,660
functionality to the front-end via the

659
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:37,690
restful api one of the features that a

660
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:41,410
lot of people were excited about titles

661
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,430
clash was a really interesting addition

662
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,810
to League of Legends

663
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:48,640
basically they wanted the players to you

664
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:52,750
feel like professional players in the

665
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:57,730
sense that they tried creating aspects

666
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:59,850
of professional play into you the normal

667
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:05,010
League of Legends experience that people

668
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:08,409
could reach so this was a very

669
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:11,830
sought-after addition to their game so

670
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:15,190
it was a bit rushed out and I'm going to

671
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:18,130
show you a few vulnerabilities in this

672
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:23,110
subsystem and how we leverage that for a

673
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:25,390
hugely impactful exploit chain so the

674
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:28,179
first vulnerability was a traditional

675
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:31,000
cross-site scripting in the client so

676
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,760
this was the dialog that you got if you

677
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,110
get invited to one of those clash teams

678
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,450
on League of Legends was very first

679
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:44,260
things we tested it was like what if we

680
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:48,819
put HTML code there and to our surprise

681
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:50,530
the image tag got rendered this is the

682
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,260
name of the team we made just like a

683
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:58,030
broken image thing and it showed up in

684
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:00,880
the remote clients dialog so we knew we

685
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,640
were on to something but there are two

686
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,910
issues we had to overcome the first is

687
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,310
the distance dialogue doesn't trigger

688
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,410
JavaScript text

689
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,259
fusion if you put an arrow most cryptic

690
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,799
there because they're using the app and

691
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,140
child

692
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,290
JavaScript function internally which

693
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,350
doesn't pop JavaScript code execution in

694
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:24,050
the script tags the other issue we had

695
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:25,069
is that the front and limited the length

696
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,640
of the team name

697
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:32,330
so our payloads had to be relatively

698
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,810
short luckily we were able to overcome

699
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:38,140
both issues the local API endpoint that

700
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,970
was provided by the C++ micro service

701
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,210
did not limit the length that was only a

702
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:48,109
check on the front parts so using the

703
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:52,400
local 8 the endpoint Wicked's push a

704
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:57,290
payload with arbitrary length and we

705
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:02,030
also figured out a way to pop JavaScript

706
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:05,600
code execution from the element that's a

707
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:08,060
planted into the DOS dialogue so we used

708
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,460
an image tag with a name bullet source

709
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,430
namely just a letter a which is

710
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:16,250
obviously invalid and we assigned an own

711
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,080
error attribute to this image tag so

712
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,800
whenever this image tag is rendered in

713
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:24,560
chrome it's broken which means the an

714
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,730
error attribute is triggered and this

715
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,759
piece of code is called

716
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:31,610
so now we could create a script element

717
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,390
from the an error attribute and load

718
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:37,490
external javascript which is then

719
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,490
appended to you the documents body and

720
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:44,259
then we have clean JavaScript code

721
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:48,379
execution in a remote client instance

722
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:50,900
you can see on the host : port part of

723
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,110
this palette I'll describe it in more

724
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,780
detail in a bit

725
00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:00,020
so where do we go from there the back

726
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:05,960
end provided an API call named exit and

727
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:10,280
run very practical for us I can tell you

728
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:13,250
so we were thinking oh wait I'll explain

729
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,430
why they have this here in the clients

730
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,609
in the first place so when they were

731
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,669
transitioning from their old client the

732
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:25,150
rebirth client for a while they were

733
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:27,759
offering the option to players to go

734
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:31,180
back to the old client in case they did

735
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:34,029
not like the new one and this transition

736
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:37,629
back to the old client happened using

737
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:40,650
this API call so whenever you clades hey

738
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:47,380
I want to go back to the old client this

739
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:49,809
API call was used to pop the old Exe but

740
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:53,220
here in this case we are free to you

741
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:56,200
call an arbitrary local executable with

742
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,288
arguments of our choosing so I'm

743
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:04,058
thinking is there a standard executable

744
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:06,130
that's at the same place on each basic

745
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:08,920
Windows install it's going to allow us

746
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:16,230
to execute code and conveniently there

747
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:19,930
is with CMD dot exe you can use the /c

748
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:23,680
command-line argument to execute any bad

749
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:27,399
comments so if you use these parameters

750
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,940
for this API call you get arbitrary code

751
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:36,099
execution while the local command

752
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:41,170
interpreter so that was our plan we're

753
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:44,200
going to make a clef team use this

754
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,569
palette to trigger JavaScript code

755
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,839
execution in the remote client and then

756
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:54,609
we'll use this API call like shown the

757
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,380
pop local CMD dot exe and then from

758
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:59,920
there we wanted to jump to PowerShell

759
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:03,849
just so we have a nicer time and you

760
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,390
know do whatever from there so this is

761
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:15,069
the time for a demo I'll show you how it

762
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:18,220
goes so this is our company and here's

763
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:22,989
our proof of concept exploit so what you

764
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:26,049
can see on the left the left side is cut

765
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:28,180
off but whatever bear with me what you

766
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:31,210
can see on the left is our exploit

767
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:33,848
application all you had to do was

768
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,609
input the Summoner name of someone who's

769
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:38,140
logged on to League of Legends and

770
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:40,660
here's a client that we have opened on

771
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:43,509
the same computer what he'll do is that

772
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:46,750
it will type the name of this person

773
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,810
who's logged on and we'll just press the

774
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:55,660
big exploit button and the remote shell

775
00:39:49,810 --> 00:40:08,980
pops and then from there we can just pop

776
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:14,109
our favorites expensive calculator thank

777
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:21,250
you so just to recap Oh what did just

778
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:23,440
happen right so at first I'm not sure if

779
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,880
I'll be able to catch this live but once

780
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,390
you press the exploit button this will

781
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:36,430
send an invite to a clash team a dialog

782
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:39,819
is going to show up here yeah it's

783
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:43,569
pretty quick that dialogue shows the

784
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:46,240
broken image tag which then triggers the

785
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,400
uh narrow attribute that then calls our

786
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,160
external javascript which is included

787
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,930
into you there you ex chromium instance

788
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:57,879
then it calls this function that's

789
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,848
provided by the back end called exit

790
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,580
syndrome which is going to pop CMD with

791
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:06,369
the argument of our choosing which is

792
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,130
then going to pop powershell which is

793
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:13,750
going to send the reverse shell to you

794
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:16,960
this application let me explain the host

795
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:19,960
and port part of this payload so we were

796
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,349
thinking how do we actually control

797
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,960
where the reverse shell goes so we

798
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:28,720
figured we could include the address of

799
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,109
the computer where we want to receive

800
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,450
the reverse shell in the team's name and

801
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:38,710
the JavaScript code that's calling the

802
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:41,080
exit and run API call takes this part of

803
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,000
the URL where the JavaScript was loaded

804
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,600
from and puts the

805
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,670
parameters into our reverse shell code

806
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,040
that's executed by the powershell

807
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:54,040
interpreter so that's how we control

808
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,400
where the powershell goes to you and

809
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,910
that's what you can also see on the

810
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:06,190
demonstration it's also pretty quick but

811
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:09,819
the powershell instance also pops right

812
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:12,190
here the quick flash of window that was

813
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:20,440
the powershell interpreter being

814
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:23,550
executed by CMD so about this story the

815
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,260
mitigation for all the issues mentioned

816
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:29,740
was deployed globally in less than eight

817
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:32,800
hours both were the client side issue

818
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:35,080
and the server side issue by which I

819
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,620
mean checking the length of the team on

820
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:41,410
the server side so here's what I've just

821
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,779
just told you about judging companies

822
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,180
that comes in big time look at their

823
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:50,620
procedure their procedure is on point

824
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:53,620
even if the code is is a bit silly their

825
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:56,380
procedure of handling this issue is very

826
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,150
good they operate a lot of shards

827
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,430
globally a lot of regions for league of

828
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:05,920
legends and having this sort of response

829
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:10,029
as more than impressive so huge props to

830
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,000
them this become the largest payout and

831
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:16,900
rides backbone in history you can

832
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,410
probably see why so I felt this was a

833
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:22,750
good showcase of the fact that impact is

834
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,540
not directly tied to technical

835
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:28,150
complexity well this was an exploit

836
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:32,140
chain but the issues that were used for

837
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:33,610
nothing credibly complex so that's

838
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,819
something you should keep in mind you

839
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,340
don't necessarily always need a rope

840
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:44,230
chain with 500 gadgets do you do

841
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:46,660
something cool so the points I was

842
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:49,140
trying to make the whole time is riot

843
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,420
was able to protect its players

844
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:55,319
specifically because people have been

845
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:58,470
thinking smart about bug bounty programs

846
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,960
there so we were able to find this

847
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,620
before blackheads to you and provide

848
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,720
this huge value to riot and the players

849
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:09,450
because they know how to do this right

850
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,120
so I encourage those of you that are in

851
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,160
charge of or maybe in charge of doing

852
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,799
something like this at your organization

853
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:22,529
to learn from their example and be smart

854
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,660
about how you do bug bounties we're

855
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,990
