1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,979
welcome everyone it's really nice to

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,950
have you here on a Saturday morning what

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,200
a dedication you don't have great I'm

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,200
not gonna delay any further since we

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,599
already had our set-up time and I'm just

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,448
gonna say lets us dive right in

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,400
we know that in information security we

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,020
all have two main challenges to deal

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,549
with most of you have the challenge of

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,939
dealing with the technical problem

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,220
securing information in your systems in

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,920
your networks in your machines in your

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,989
organization's machines and then there

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,750
is a second challenge the human one

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,459
people what happens with the ones that

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,110
have access to this information and can

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,530
provide access to this information

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,469
what happens with the ones that know too

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,719
much the ones that deal with sensitive

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,390
and a lot of times expensive information

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,949
in a day to day and can distribute and

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,620
sell it why they shouldn't I'm gonna

23
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,010
start with the story and therefore we

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,230
are going

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,080
forget about to forget about the fact

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,810
that we have slides first of all because

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,658
what the clicker doesn't work the story

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,060
is about Gabrielle Gabrielle was a woman

29
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,369
back in the days during the Cold War in

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,530
Germany while Germany was divided

31
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,130
between two parts East and West Germany

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,080
through the Berlin Wall gabrielle was

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,298
sitting by the river one day just

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,700
enjoying her day before going to work

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,259
why she suddenly saw a man coming and

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,500
sitting next to her and started talking

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,900
to her that one was called Frank

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,380
according to her own account he was the

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,600
man of her dreams she saw him they

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,649
talked for five minutes she knew that

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,229
was the man she always wanted he was a

42
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,180
man she always wanted he was working on

43
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,649
a project that was promoting world peace

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,350
he wanted to make the world a better

45
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,640
place or lo and behold soon while they

46
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,699
were getting to know each other more and

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,369
more his he asked her for some support

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,280
with his projects he asked for documents

49
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,920
from her work what was the case

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,170
she did she did it because she wanted to

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,119
help his mission she wanted to help she

52
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,629
believed in his cause I

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,160
see really really liked him to be honest

54
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:16,290
together document says to give a few

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,790
than she gave more to get some more

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:24,480
she gave way too many because he was a

57
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,340
man of her dreams and he was so because

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,709
she was thoroughly provide on the

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,019
background from a team of experts you

60
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,090
see she was the translator for the

61
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,569
American Embassy on the west side and

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,340
Frank Frank was a spy from the

63
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,119
intelligence community of the West

64
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,160
Germany he he made her give away

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,250
thousands of documents which agad Lee

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,489
did she didn't know why but she did and

67
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,140
she had to compromise a hell lot of

68
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:57,690
intelligence missions that way now what

69
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,569
is the only one no she was not they were

70
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,720
about 40 women that got convicted in

71
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:06,660
West Germany for espionage and there

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,879
were a lot of spies which they called

73
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,430
Romeo's who on the other side were

74
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,410
getting awarded for their amazing work

75
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:18,600
with their assets that was the

76
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,250
brainchild of Marcus wolf who said that

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,739
was a very cost-effective way of

78
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,150
stealing secrets or in other words it

79
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,040
was a very cost effective way of

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,599
breaching security in bridging

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,000
information security the one that

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,959
existed at the time where they've

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,730
enhanced oh no they looked like they

84
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,709
didn't look all that great but you know

85
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,078
what they didn't have to because they

86
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,359
Carson psychology they Carson plain

87
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,010
human psychology something that works

88
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,130
again and again and again and although

89
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,709
this is a very old story this continues

90
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,200
to happen today with different means now

91
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,700
you might make the little connection

92
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,160
that here we talk about profiling in

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,950
social media so this is a more modern

94
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:04,829
way we now have more assets to use and

95
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:07,290
involves words he said that the incident

96
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,359
always justified the means which was the

97
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,910
employ of course and he also said that

98
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,549
as long there is a CEO not corporate

99
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,709
espionage as we have it today there will

100
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,890
be Romeo said using a suspected Juliet's

101
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,149
with access to secrets after only was

102
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,750
running an intelligence service

103
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:27,120
I only hired Caleb do you think it is

104
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,120
any different today do you think that

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,039
now that people need access to systems

106
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,600
and information and they know the

107
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,090
technology is hard to get you think

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,280
they're not going to exploit the good

109
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,179
old vulnerabilities of existing humans

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,960
that work consistently and they work

111
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,199
successfully they do but who am I to

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,659
talk about Ali that I am a psychologist

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,380
and I am a social engineers way in fact

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,970
I have been in this line of business and

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,180
in InfoSec since I can practically

116
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,919
remember myself because of my father who

117
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,539
is a cyber security expert as well and

118
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
he got me involved into protecting

119
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:08,099
things since I was really really young

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,530
and I was also really really curious so

121
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,510
I was finding more and more with him and

122
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,210
through him and I ended up working in

123
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,909
the field today I am a trainer and

124
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:22,349
consultant and I am also a speaker in

125
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,960
Europe US and Asia it's surprising and

126
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:28,680
you are going to say that the problems

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,880
are the same all around the world and I

128
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,099
focus on the human element of security

129
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,590
now we all know that there are four main

130
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:39,750
ways of breaching security network

131
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,780
beaches software bridges physical

132
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,820
bridges or Hardware bridges as you call

133
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,448
it and of course what we talked about

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,969
today and now the human exploitation but

135
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:53,580
how important is it really well

136
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,240
we were already warned about it from

137
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,280
DARPA two three years ago they put out

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,620
the project they said why we focus the

139
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,530
vast majority of security efforts on

140
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,889
protecting computers and networks more

141
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,710
than 80% of cyberattacks and over 70 of

142
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,289
those from nation states are initiated

143
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:19,159
by exploiting humans rather than

144
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:23,849
computer and net security flaws that was

145
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:27,030
2017 what about today Anisa came out

146
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:30,180
this year 2019 and did a categorization

147
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,270
a taxonomy practically in their state

148
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,880
landscape report of 2018

149
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,299
and what did they say they say that

150
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,889
thing number one observed said that

151
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,180
exist today in our cybersecurity

152
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,889
landscape is you guessed it human

153
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,870
exploitation and not just the phishing

154
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,060
emails that everybody knows and that the

155
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,740
phishing emails are a big celebrity out

156
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,030
there in terms of what happens and

157
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,430
everybody pays a lot of attention to

158
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,840
them yes they work yes they are good yes

159
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,319
there is a lot of damage to them but

160
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,810
it's not the only one and this is what

161
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,690
they reported as well it's a whole

162
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,830
spectrum of human exploitation emails

163
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:13,590
phone calls impersonations you name it

164
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,419
everything that has to do with breaching

165
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:21,060
security through finding vulnerabilities

166
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:23,639
in humans and this is also what we talk

167
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,009
about now how many of you are familiar

168
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,419
with social engineering and how it works

169
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:33,659
by a show of hands very nice so you know

170
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:38,090
that it is not just about all about

171
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:41,039
charm and luck and it's not all about us

172
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,080
having it in you and being socially ATAG

173
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,340
now they are very plan they're very

174
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,940
organized and they have a strategy

175
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,580
always a strategy that has two parts

176
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,520
planning and preparation very important

177
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,130
and execution it starts with those

178
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,349
things gathering everything and anything

179
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,440
they can about an organization or about

180
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,789
a person your deepest darkest secrets

181
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,080
they are particularly good for that

182
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,090
targeting and identifying who would be a

183
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,520
good target who would heal the best ROI

184
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,109
the best return for their efforts and

185
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,318
who would kill the lowest risk of

186
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,030
detection and after identifying who the

187
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,740
target would be making sure they have a

188
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,090
pretext or a story through which they

189
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,909
can approach this person and ultimately

190
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,500
exploit him when it comes to the

191
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,229
execution again the steps are usually

192
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,120
pretty standard this is a backbone they

193
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:31,770
approach they get a certain level of

194
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,630
chance you feel like you're on the same

195
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:39,120
page exploit this chance and disappear

196
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,159
and ideally the other person will never

197
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,539
ever know that something went on that

198
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,399
something happened

199
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,670
the information was liquid was not

200
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,860
supposed to be leaked and that's why

201
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,959
today we have a lot of breaches were in

202
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,870
the news day right we don't know what

203
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,250
was the initial stage of compromised we

204
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,779
don't know how they had this inside

205
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,380
information what happened how did they

206
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,759
get them

207
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:06,060
well maybe you can now guess why they

208
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,819
didn't have this information so

209
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,310
certainly all synced open source

210
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:13,410
intelligence is a very big part of it

211
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,969
and it is a very important part of it

212
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,779
because it's the foundation of the whole

213
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,800
attack but there is a subdivision of all

214
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,459
things that we are going to talk about

215
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,279
the day and this is sock mint sock mint

216
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,279
is the social media intelligence now all

217
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,189
of us penetration tester social

218
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,050
engineers before we start finding out

219
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,199
who we want to target we are going to go

220
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,329
and search for social media profiles

221
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,979
because people talk too much and we want

222
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,979
to hear what they have to say and what

223
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:48,779
they have to expose so social media is

224
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:52,170
our go-to in reality social media was a

225
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:56,610
very big focus and a very big point of

226
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,319
attack in 2017 we had companies yeah we

227
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,019
had companies bringing out reports

228
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:03,479
saying that about 20% of businesses were

229
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,819
infected by by malware tightly through

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,240
social media we will see how this can

231
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,519
happen

232
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,430
employees experiencing cybercrime more

233
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,130
often on social medias and celebrities

234
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,519
phishing emails and Facebook's comes

235
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,279
being the number one used ways to bridge

236
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,079
networks because we when we are in

237
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,889
social media we really like we are in a

238
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,930
friendly environment but I really

239
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:31,279
depends how many of you have people on

240
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:38,579
social media that you don't really know

241
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:42,720
nobody wants to say so social media is

242
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:44,819
still utilized today why because we see

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,180
this platforms for sharing and staying

244
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,920
updated with friends but attack you see

245
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,339
it is a very very nice

246
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,620
fertile ground to gather information and

247
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,480
targets they use what they find in order

248
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,430
to get a better direction about how they

249
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,649
are going to approach you really their

250
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,569
approach will depend on how much you say

251
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,810
who you are as a person what moves you

252
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:09,339
what are your interests in life because

253
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,369
they need to be able to hook you somehow

254
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:14,050
and then their creativity and this is

255
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,329
why we have a lot of different types of

256
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,800
attacks as well because they don't

257
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:23,649
depend on something standard they depend

258
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,719
on who you are when they are tailored we

259
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,970
talked about the around meals and what

260
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,709
happened back then I told you that this

261
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,170
is something that still happens today in

262
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:35,290
different ways and when you have

263
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,399
specific tailored targeted attacks most

264
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,379
of the times there is a nation-state

265
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,730
behind them because that takes time that

266
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:44,500
takes a lot of investment to get done so

267
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,959
and of course when you have somebody

268
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,480
getting compromised on an emotional

269
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,329
level there is no evidence left behind

270
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,509
that is hard that's what happens with

271
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:57,489
forensic with digital forensics and

272
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,459
nobody wants to report it so they barely

273
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,529
ever any reports on social media a lot

274
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,750
of things happen on that domain nobody

275
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,040
wants to report them they hide it but

276
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,740
there was one case that was reported

277
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,189
that was the study case of Mia Ashe and

278
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,949
that's because she was an apt and she

279
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:16,120
was very persistent she hid a lot of

280
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,839
organizations and a lot of specific

281
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,199
people now Mia Ashe was the result of a

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,779
state actor called cobalt racing she

283
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,170
targeted the critical infrastructure in

284
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:32,769
the Middle East and North Africa and

285
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,649
mainly government defense oil financial

286
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,269
services telecommunications things that

287
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,990
belong to the critical infrastructure

288
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,360
now Mia Ashe was not exactly what they

289
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,990
wanted to do from the very beginning she

290
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,290
was plan B plan a was large-scale

291
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,240
phishing attacks delivering a popular

292
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,879
remote access tool but that didn't

293
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,529
really work very well they didn't pan

294
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,699
out the way they wanted so they decided

295
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:00,759
to do a morte

296
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:03,128
the approach they created these accounts

297
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,109
on LinkedIn and a pretty much all social

298
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:08,350
media of Mia's a very beautiful young

299
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:10,480
lady with a lot of interests in life and

300
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:15,549
wanted to share them with the others

301
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:18,339
and they decided to target people but

302
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:20,169
I'm gonna cut this story in half keep it

303
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:23,290
in the back of your heads we will return

304
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:26,369
to it and kind of talk about how this

305
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,660
all really works out in the end

306
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:33,309
what happens in your social media

307
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:35,499
accounts so you have to do possibly

308
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,029
scenarios you might search in social

309
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:39,910
media accounts and find this quick

310
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:41,980
opportunistic attacks one piece of

311
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,639
information that you can utilize on spot

312
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:48,309
and just go home early at night or you

313
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,480
actually will need to do a long game now

314
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:51,699
when it comes to the opportunistic

315
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,519
attacks I will show you a few posts and

316
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:57,819
you will see how you can deliver attack

317
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,709
really really fast through them for

318
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:05,469
example these are all real posts a

319
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:07,719
person asking a specific bank and saying

320
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,079
that they urgently need to generate a

321
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,299
bank account statement at work how do I

322
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,039
go about that or a person asking a

323
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,049
different company something about the

324
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,749
tickets going wrong and asking for an

325
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:23,169
email just for a person to resend them

326
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:24,879
the tickets on their email account what

327
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:26,410
is the possibility that they can really

328
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,389
quickly happen out of that the person

329
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,389
will respond to because they expected

330
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:38,709
both a phishing email I didn't

331
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,419
most likely keep on it I should be more

332
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:44,469
concerned about my work but I'm really

333
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:46,149
not possible attack well you know that

334
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,259
they if they don't really care about

335
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,759
their work they don't really care about

336
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:54,069
the work environment they definitely

337
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,249
don't care about security so if you

338
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:59,378
bring out a good story and the USP they

339
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:01,809
will not really chew on it too much they

340
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:04,809
don't care chances are they will plug it

341
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:07,509
in good target same goes with people

342
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:09,339
that really hate their jobs they're not

343
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,030
going to think about security they might

344
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:14,300
even want to purposefully

345
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,490
heard their companies because they hate

346
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,250
them anyways this is when they might as

347
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,260
well turn into inside their heads so

348
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,230
what happens there again they will not

349
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:28,490
think twice about protecting the

350
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,620
organization good targets and then we

351
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,080
have back again in the case of the Romeo

352
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,870
sandy espionage case people that are

353
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,770
lonely people that say I'm not alone

354
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,780
because the only miss is my only friend

355
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,970
romance fraudsters work really well with

356
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,699
them unfortunately and this is of course

357
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,490
something that professionals cannot use

358
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:55,100
as an attack but criminals to use all

359
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,780
the time and it consistently works again

360
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,370
something that professionals cannot use

361
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,160
but criminals use consistently is

362
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,380
bribery and blackmail and when it comes

363
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,260
to bribe a practically people that need

364
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,230
money right now are people that have an

365
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,980
addiction they are also being driven by

366
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,200
the detection there they are victims to

367
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,270
the addiction so if an attacker comes by

368
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,250
and offers them money to support that or

369
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,579
to support a very deep need they have

370
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,320
right now chances are that they will do

371
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,420
it because if we have a higher priority

372
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,300
than protecting a company especially if

373
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,420
they think they can get away with it

374
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,520
good targets with blackmail while this

375
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,589
happens again it's not very easy to use

376
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,630
social media about that but you can find

377
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,120
little indications on social media like

378
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,520
possibly a face and then just dig a

379
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,070
little bit further have your angle and

380
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,110
see whether they can deliver attack so

381
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,790
basically and generally it is a very

382
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,560
good thing not to expose Waggoner

383
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,630
abilities on social media to generally

384
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,150
be a little bit more cautious and

385
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,430
conscious about what you posted out

386
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:02,569
there because it can and will be used

387
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,579
especially if you have open profiles but

388
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,380
say your social media savvy you don't do

389
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,199
these things do you think twice you hold

390
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,540
the professional image on social media

391
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,910
you don't really do these things what

392
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,349
happens then what happens if you don't

393
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:20,570
do any of these things and you're really

394
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:23,500
careful but you could yield a high ROI

395
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,418
for an attacker

396
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,329
we're going to talk about the second

397
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:30,370
example profiling I'm going to show you

398
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,879
the profile of a real person a real

399
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,129
individual I the only one who allowed me

400
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,539
to scrutinize him publicly multiple

401
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,070
times so just for the sake of the

402
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,169
example but the principles are the same

403
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:48,850
throughout any profiles and think of

404
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:50,470
your own when we talk about this one

405
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,168
thing about social media profiles is

406
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,559
what they show about us they show who we

407
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,990
are yes but remember that it shows what

408
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,340
you want others to see practically which

409
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,549
means that yes it has elements of you

410
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,678
but it's not really entirely you it's

411
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,830
the way you want to be sitting by others

412
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,409
the way others want you want others to

413
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,699
view you and treat you which is perfect

414
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,990
for social engineers because this is

415
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,309
exactly what they want to give you they

416
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,980
want to give you what you want so that

417
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:21,039
you may like them and so that they can

418
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,500
get you on their side so it's you

419
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,840
curated what are specific aspects that

420
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,400
they will look for they are going to

421
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,918
look into your personal brand the

422
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,140
general way you carry yourself are you

423
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,549
confident you know what you're doing do

424
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,190
you have insecurities that you have

425
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:38,620
unmet needs that are very obvious to be

426
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,770
figured out what is going on the

427
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:44,408
selection of your words do you express

428
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,059
long limit do you express that you need

429
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:48,490
certain things that you don't have and

430
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,270
possibly they could give to you for the

431
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,280
exchange of a little something something

432
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,470
what are your interests your activities

433
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,789
this is ground we're gonna talk about it

434
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,919
through which you can build rapport with

435
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:02,500
someone your work responsibilities going

436
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,750
back to the ROI could you be a good

437
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,570
value of good value would will be a good

438
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,010
attack a good target

439
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:14,799
social life indications and of course

440
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:19,000
subjects once one feels strong about the

441
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:23,700
profile the real person that I told you

442
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,799
about is him for the sake of our example

443
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,260
now what you see is some pictures but I

444
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,809
can guess that you already can have

445
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,149
certain thoughts about that person about

446
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:36,459
who they are and why do you have

447
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:40,658
certain thoughts about you because of

448
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:42,159
this shadow talk the shadow talk is the

449
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:45,699
things that we did we say without

450
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:48,039
speaking it includes body language he's

451
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:52,509
a person confident do they have an open

452
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:55,209
body language he does if he closed up

453
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,619
and reserved and probably shy and

454
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,849
probably doesn't want to talk to you

455
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:01,238
ever because he doesn't want to talk to

456
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:04,448
anyone ever you look into these things

457
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:06,309
this is shadow talk you look into the

458
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:07,959
variety of their expressions why because

459
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,969
ultimately you're going to know if this

460
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:12,849
person is going to be reserved and not

461
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:14,289
talk really loud or they are going to be

462
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:16,479
willing to talk they are Express if they

463
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:18,729
use their face to communicate with your

464
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:20,049
outer world and especially when you put

465
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:23,439
that on social media you know that you

466
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:26,519
can generally appear very expressive and

467
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:28,989
potentially be expressive with strangers

468
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:32,049
now you don't see his face but I didn't

469
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:33,999
until you his wet face you look at the

470
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,859
content the variety of his activities to

471
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,409
see whether it is a person that has

472
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,239
almost nothing going on in his life or

473
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:43,029
whether it is a person that has a lot of

474
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,649
going on in his life if for example he

475
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:45,999
was a person that would have nothing

476
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:49,418
going on in his life you would know that

477
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:50,949
he probably would want some say he would

478
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,349
probably want his little adventure he

479
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:55,749
would probably want to feel life now

480
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:57,609
this target has a lot of things going on

481
00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:03,219
so you would need to sing in a different

482
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:04,899
way you look at the colors and why there

483
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:07,059
is a psychological principle that

484
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:09,728
connects practically the colors we feel

485
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:12,279
attracted to when we choose to pertain

486
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:15,189
our profiles and the way we feel

487
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,649
emotionally inside people that are

488
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:18,849
highly depressed people that are sad and

489
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:21,339
sorry usually tend to have very

490
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:23,438
black-and-white and heavy dark pictures

491
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:26,529
melancholic people people will feel too

492
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:32,259
poetic we will have some darkness inside

493
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:34,479
tend to have harder darker colors and

494
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:37,029
people that are euphoric and confident

495
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:39,129
like generally more happy tend to have

496
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,779
happier colors and now you can see

497
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:46,080
what's gonna pop up in the profile

498
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:48,000
mathematics with this person locations

499
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,460
again as we said before it does he walk

500
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,340
around does he stay at home does he have

501
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,200
an interesting life you look into these

502
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,100
things and you look into other people

503
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,930
are there others how many are there

504
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,300
different people does he stick with one

505
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,950
specific group or is he willing to get

506
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,180
to know others and get out of his

507
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:11,640
comfort zone this was this information

508
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,620
you need to categorize it you need to so

509
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,200
that you can analyze it so we have the

510
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,750
profiling matrix the profiling matrix is

511
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,600
four columns the personality traits

512
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,640
somebody has that portray through social

513
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,250
media

514
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,300
interests wants because we all want to

515
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:33,570
act or it's our best interest and their

516
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,159
vulnerabilities if they are there and

517
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,669
you look into the three domains of

518
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,120
everybody's lives our self-image our

519
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,320
social life and our work life these are

520
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,719
the three main categories of what's

521
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,429
going on our life and as we said before

522
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,530
he looks pretty confident he looks

523
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,650
pretty expressive his facial expressions

524
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,720
he definitely appears to have an

525
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,950
interesting fitness he definitely

526
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,460
appears to have an interest in traveling

527
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,020
and being very alive and negative and

528
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,120
he's into social events and events with

529
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,000
other people so you put the rolling but

530
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,429
these so far is just assumptions you

531
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,920
need to strengthen these assumptions so

532
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,160
that you can better rely on them so by

533
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,740
knowing what you just have assumptions

534
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:21,990
you look further you look into the words

535
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:24,860
he uses you look into patterns and you

536
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:27,540
look into the way he expresses himself

537
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,100
now the way he expresses himself because

538
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,670
this is also a little bit of a marketing

539
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,500
profile he is a dream monitor with

540
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:38,850
access to a lot of records of CEOs and

541
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,200
high-profile individuals keep it in the

542
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:44,280
back of your heads because a lot of

543
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,110
attacks work by proxy he is caught

544
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,500
however a little easy it's not my fault

545
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,600
sorry sorry in advance

546
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:55,410
he writes hostile to make your dreams a

547
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,780
reality life is a game play doing and

548
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,350
let your hustle be louder than your

549
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,200
words I have already

550
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:07,120
collected similar things what does that

551
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:10,780
tell you about the personality it tells

552
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:14,050
you that he's ambitious is this ambition

553
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,730
coming out is he is it working here at

554
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,590
don't decrease the coal increase the

555
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,830
effort he talks about a goal he once put

556
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,510
in life and he made it happen and

557
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:25,899
actually he talks many times about goals

558
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,970
that he actually made happen that she

559
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,980
succeeded upon so yours understand that

560
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,300
use determines you keep it in the back

561
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,510
of your head you're gonna fill it in

562
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:37,629
later you look further they care about

563
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,180
income I care about impact and lifting

564
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,190
humans as always bins more fun than

565
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,310
lifting weights in the similar thing of

566
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,540
this whole Fitness interest and you

567
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,820
understand that he wants to be

568
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,950
influential this way he wants to have an

569
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,870
impact on people he cares about people

570
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:57,700
he he wants a connection and this is

571
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,439
also very nice man for social engineers

572
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,900
and it matters very much on whether you

573
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,050
will approach him and how he says what

574
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,760
is life without a little risk make your

575
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,620
life an adventure nigga he talks about

576
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,350
adventure which means that he's

577
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,600
relatively willing to step out of his

578
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,780
comfort zone and to do things he

579
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,659
wouldn't have done otherwise or he

580
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,190
wasn't hasn't done before and this is

581
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,740
important for you to know because people

582
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,570
that are very conservative are generally

583
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,370
going to be harder targets because they

584
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,439
will be scared to step out of their

585
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,419
comfort zone when somebody's being

586
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,120
socially engineered it practically

587
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,160
requires you to do something you

588
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,620
wouldn't otherwise do so you need

589
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:43,360
someone that is willing to take risks

590
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:45,129
and do stuff for you so the fact that he

591
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,889
is adventurous is suddenly really really

592
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,770
useful and then the fact that he is also

593
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,830
an extrovert and especially the part

594
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,090
where he says making new friends as part

595
00:25:53,830 --> 00:26:00,760
of should be part of everyday entry and

596
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,429
the best today is I'm having a breakfast

597
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:07,360
I start chatting with a random guy next

598
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:09,430
to me I know you know as you know ready

599
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,169
before you suspected that he's an

600
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,530
extrovert and that if you approach him

601
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,410
you can engage him

602
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:19,879
you can approach him the right way you

603
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:22,340
can probably go really far with it you

604
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,840
put it all in the matrix you strengthen

605
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,340
the assumptions you had before now you

606
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,110
know he's an accelerator you know you

607
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,320
can approach him you know he cares about

608
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:33,080
people and engaging with them and having

609
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,120
an impact on them you know he wants to

610
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,129
advance so this is a motivating factor

611
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,699
if you give him an incentive that helps

612
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:43,580
him advance as a doctor you could have

613
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,610
him and you know he wants a condition

614
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:49,850
and mutation and all these things and

615
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,729
that he will talk with you but you don't

616
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:55,399
know anything about his father abilities

617
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,900
or his professional life what do you do

618
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,490
okay of course there are like there is

619
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,010
LinkedIn you can do a Google search but

620
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,900
to understand how far this can go you

621
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,440
can practically connect the points you

622
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,610
had before and make deductions how many

623
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,860
of you would think that a person like

624
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,399
him would be a back of his type of

625
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,229
person I didn't see any hand and you are

626
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,700
correct he would never be a back of his

627
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,310
type of person he would always and

628
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,930
forever want to be in the front line he

629
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:24,260
would want to have contact with the

630
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,910
customers which is very good for you you

631
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,460
know nothing about his vulnerabilities

632
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,340
but there is again a general

633
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:34,730
psychological principle that says that

634
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,530
if we pursue one goal with dollar

635
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,560
strengthened with all our heart it means

636
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:43,160
that at the same time we try to avoid by

637
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:46,550
all means its opposite so you take his

638
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,650
wants and you reverse them what this

639
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:50,330
person would really hate to be isn't

640
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,400
effective what this person would really

641
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,649
hate to be is to be perceived as a

642
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,910
failure he would hate to be

643
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,100
uninteresting

644
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,620
he like if you were to stab at him and

645
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,699
tell him look I have shared with you all

646
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,729
these things we had this whole

647
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,110
conversation but man you you haven't

648
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,820
taught me anything so this has been

649
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,050
pretty boring for me sorry to tell you

650
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,730
that he we want to prove himself he we

651
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,500
want to prove that he has something to

652
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,330
offer and if you had told him about all

653
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,890
of your work problems and say that look

654
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,600
I told about all of my work problems you

655
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,360
haven't shared one with me this is

656
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,050
getting really boring you will feel the

657
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,050
need to prove you wrong

658
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:32,690
so you put the Rimac into account and

659
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:36,529
you use it strategically how does all

660
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,840
that work the personality traits are

661
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:42,739
used to build a rapport you know who

662
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,389
that person is you know what he responds

663
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:47,539
to we like people that we have

664
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:50,629
similarities we so you use a lot the

665
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,249
interesting one sir hooks practically if

666
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:55,639
the person is interested about a topic

667
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:58,789
he's going to engage about it if he has

668
00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:02,299
certain wants that he wants to achieve

669
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:05,029
and you can provide them for him chances

670
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:06,349
are he will consider it the veneer

671
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:08,960
because you used to typically when a

672
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:11,359
terrorist doesn't really work on or

673
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,669
doesn't seem to be going to way so that

674
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,639
you can trigger him a little bit in to

675
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,440
get his points and then of course you

676
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:20,089
adjust the approach according to how it

677
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,210
goes you always need to improvise a

678
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:27,408
little bit afternoon you have so much to

679
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:29,419
work with now about your own pretext if

680
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:33,469
you are a social engineer what do you do

681
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:35,839
with all that well as we said we like

682
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:38,450
people that are like us so you're going

683
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,879
to use all that chances are the social

684
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,879
engineer is going to look a lot like you

685
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:53,649
remember Mia ash that's what she did she

686
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:55,700
decided to build profiles that

687
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:58,099
disappeared to want to build connections

688
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,019
with people and establish rapport but

689
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:03,950
mainly she wanted to do her research on

690
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:07,309
them she established connections through

691
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,169
common interests mainly photography and

692
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,629
she started talking with people once she

693
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:13,759
had established that connection she

694
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:16,189
started escalating them she has collated

695
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,529
them from LinkedIn to facebook to

696
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,440
instagram to other social media accounts

697
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,330
to a phone number the conversation kept

698
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,320
going she had a lot to say they had so

699
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:29,539
much in common and eventually she would

700
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,330
also get their email work there to work

701
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,950
in mail and once that would be provided

702
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,710
she would say at some point an

703
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,520
attachment saying that oh by the way I

704
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,380
have to submit this portfolio

705
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,139
your help on that can you just take two

706
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,370
and leave fast because I have to do it

707
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,020
in half an hour can use a semi if

708
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,750
everything is alright I would really

709
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:53,250
appreciate your feedback do you think it

710
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:55,230
was successful I heard Chris was

711
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,180
successful it was extremely successful

712
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,950
it was so successful that they kept

713
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,650
doing it again and again and again again

714
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:05,010
and SecureWorks ended up having so much

715
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,990
data to work with because it was so

716
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,810
efficient and effective and you saw how

717
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:14,010
it happened and you know that if it had

718
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:19,860
happened to you chances are you might

719
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:21,870
have kicked on the others way the final

720
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:26,909
de Rivoli would deliver that poppy red

721
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:30,570
the one that people didn't click on when

722
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,610
the phishing email was distributed but

723
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:37,639
they did click on when it was delivered

724
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:37,639
by mia who was a person they felt I knew

725
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,260
so we said before we seen the news a lot

726
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,629
of pitches and we always say huh it was

727
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,540
information that was inside information

728
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,370
we don't know how they got them it looks

729
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,530
like such a big mystery how did they

730
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:55,350
reach that how did they initiate the

731
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,540
attack how did that work out do you kind

732
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,000
of wonder how that worked down now or do

733
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,560
you kind of know how that worked out do

734
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
you think that if she continued the

735
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,139
conversation if she had gotten specific

736
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,820
questions if she had asked specific

737
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,040
questions would the people have

738
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,230
responded would they have potentially

739
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,670
leaked things about their workplaces

740
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:20,430
they were not supposed probably social

741
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:24,720
engineers use social media to cultivate

742
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:27,360
relationships to build relationships

743
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,730
they do not shy away from bathing

744
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,090
long-term relationships even especially

745
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,270
when it comes to espionage but always

746
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,010
remember that this relationship and the

747
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,680
person on the other side is not really a

748
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:44,370
person for them it is an asset for them

749
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:47,820
and it is treated as an asset but it

750
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,800
doesn't look that way now that I made

751
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,470
you all paranoid I have to also given

752
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,720
after

753
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,610
avoiding this paranoia actually because

754
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,009
you might think okay then maybe we

755
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,080
shouldn't post anything everything could

756
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:02,080
be used against us anything could be

757
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,090
used against us yes good sorry but don't

758
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,490
get paranoid it's not about not sharing

759
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,080
anything it's also not about liking

760
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,490
yourselves in your room was putting

761
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,039
newspapers on your windows and not

762
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:16,419
talking to anyone anymore no the point

763
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:19,000
here is about boundaries know what your

764
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:21,580
boundaries are and enforce them and when

765
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,559
people ask you very nosy information

766
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,600
about your jobs remember that you can

767
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,668
always say no I'm sorry but I cannot

768
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,428
disclose that or no I'm not going to

769
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:31,929
talk about that and the users need to

770
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,919
know that they have to do that as well

771
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:37,720
put a limit and put a boundary to what

772
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,070
you share in what you do and when you

773
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:45,480
know that it's policy not to open

774
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:48,580
attachments from outside resources

775
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,590
enforce that and actually stick with it

776
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,289
and that can convince to do otherwise

777
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,750
just because a cute lady or whoever you

778
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:58,899
have a connection with suddenly decided

779
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,669
to send you an attachment at work so

780
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:02,199
this talk is not about not doing

781
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:02,559
anything anymore in hiding from the

782
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,700
world

783
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:11,109
it's about enforcing boundaries remember

784
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:13,089
this is war your companies are castles

785
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:15,279
so you would try to protect the castle

786
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,319
what do you do you do you do have walls

787
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,010
you do have physical security that's

788
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:23,949
there it's there for you you all here

789
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,079
working enforcing the security wet bone

790
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,270
situation back in the days when we had

791
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,040
castles to protect this used to be

792
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,230
cannons this used to be weapons this

793
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,480
used to be anything that could work to

794
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:37,300
deter attackers you would do this today

795
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,980
with antiviruses with security systems

796
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,750
with all the implementation technical

797
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,819
implementation that we try to do and it

798
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,159
works really well any think racism it

799
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:48,779
gets better and better

800
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,829
so that's nicely getting there

801
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,970
but then what happens when your

802
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:56,500
population opens back doors to strangers

803
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:59,078
do they know who the enemies do they

804
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,910
know who what they look like how they

805
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:05,569
act and do they know how did the

806
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:08,750
and when the time comes to defend and

807
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:10,730
what am I getting at with all that is

808
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,160
that security mindset and culture

809
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,510
matters and why a lot of you think that

810
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,549
oh come on it's such a waste of money

811
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,500
and it's such a waste of time to try to

812
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:21,020
build a security culture to make people

813
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,119
more aware to get them to know and to

814
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,740
get them to care about security and what

815
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,380
security is about because they will

816
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,689
never care no they wait here

817
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,760
as long as you do it right certainly

818
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,430
it's a sensitive point to make them

819
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,520
carry and it's not gonna happen if you

820
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:41,240
just give them a training series full of

821
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,309
videos they do not connect with but

822
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,470
there are ways to make them care and you

823
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,789
should invest in that because this is

824
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,589
the environment that your whole

825
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:50,960
technical infrastructure is going to

826
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:53,690
operating and if your technical

827
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,410
infrastructure is amazing but the user

828
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,049
is totally unaware and is used against

829
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:04,430
you thing the efforts are for nothing

830
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:06,589
are cute I keep that in mind keep your

831
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,509
mind on the user to train them to care

832
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:10,250
about them to tell them things when you

833
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,119
come in contact with them so that they

834
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:15,349
can slowly build a security mindset I

835
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,990
know that's it's not gonna happen

836
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:21,589
overnight but it can happen it really

837
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,288
eventually happens and it is their

838
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:28,990
personal responsibility as well it's not

839
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:28,990
as yours thank you

840
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,910
