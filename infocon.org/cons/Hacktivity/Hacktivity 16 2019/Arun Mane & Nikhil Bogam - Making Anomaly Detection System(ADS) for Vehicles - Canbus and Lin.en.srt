1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,889
so hi this is a rule today today's

2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,370
festival in India we are from the India

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,039
actually so the festival name is Diwali

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,869
so I wish you happy Diwali to everyone

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,939
and this is my introduction it's like my

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,009
name is Arun money and I'm founder and

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:32,399
director of a ministry claps it's its

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:35,430
recently we launched company and my

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,270
interest lies in hardware security IOT

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,610
vehicle and IC sazzle so I'm speaker and

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,190
trainer of lot of conferences like black

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:52,530
at DEFCON and null Khan HIV mean what's

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,849
not and this is my Twitter if you really

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,610
want to reach me you can reach me on

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,610
this Twitter and this is my email id

16
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,690
hello

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,710
I'm Nicola bogum and basically safety

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,320
and security manager at Lear cooperation

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,289
I have almost decade experience in

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,589
automotive recently started with cyber

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,420
security in the field speaker also in

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:27,840
route con cocoon ofc sides besides so

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:30,329
yeah that's it thanks so what exactly

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,710
the car so this definition of those

25
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,880
people who don't know the what exactly

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,539
the cars so it's a formula more than you

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,298
can see the the more than more than two

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,619
wheels you can see and it transport the

29
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,860
people on one location to another

30
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,430
locations so yeah you can you can see on

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:55,079
the Wikipedia as well so what exactly

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,380
the comes in the car so if you see a lot

33
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,289
of communications over here like like in

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,020
transmission control unit and key folks

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,460
and entity type opt to TPM as their

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,369
different kind of communication you can

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,250
see on the vehicles so

38
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,730
now you can see it comes connected with

39
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,010
the Wi-Fi Bluetooth and the cellular

40
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,470
technology as well so there are some

41
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,190
devices which comes with the third-party

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,390
vendors

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,280
now if the car your car is not smart

44
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,929
enough so we can put those devices in

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,910
the car so it can be a smart car as well

46
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,310
so we are we are going to jump on

47
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:41,380
directly to obd2 so buddy 2 is onboard

48
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:46,090
diagnostic connectors so if you see if

49
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,799
we see here the 6 and 14 pins 14 is for

50
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,549
the can low and the can high

51
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:55,660
so nothing but we are talking about the

52
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:57,220
the can bus protocol and for the ground

53
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,640
they have ground

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,209
jacy's and crown signals so this is Oh

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,359
buddy to port if you see in the European

56
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,540
they call it as a EO buddy - Oh buddy Oh

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,569
buddy that is European onboard

58
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,260
diagnostic and you can find those

59
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:20,708
connectors and a lot of lot of cars like

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:24,220
here is near to you know driver seat

61
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,349
below the driver seat also and you can

62
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,799
see over here as well these are the obd2

63
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:34,780
connectors so you can use some sort of

64
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,790
Oh buddy - to db9 or the Oh buddy - 2

65
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,220
USB connectors and you can connect and

66
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,429
if you have so those devices hardware

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,709
devices which can talk on canvas and

68
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,750
Lane protocol and other you dias packets

69
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,549
and everything so you can directly

70
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,889
communicate with the cars and you can

71
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,919
sniff communication you can do a lot of

72
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:57,130
but it's it's just a physical testing or

73
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,769
other physical hacking you can say so

74
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,000
some sort of some cars you can see those

75
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:05,709
kind of the structure Oh buddy -

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,040
connectors so we you need to buy those

77
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:12,760
connectors and which converts to USB or

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,700
other db9 connectors so this is

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,548
typically the EcoP series engine control

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,899
unit if we talk about the ancients if we

81
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,789
talk about the other comes like the

82
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,770
air bag and other systems brakes and

83
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,280
everything we call it as a electronic

84
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:31,150
control unit so these these nothing but

85
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,340
the embedded device which comes with

86
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,219
different flavor chipsets it may be

87
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,549
armed so it may be an XP chipsets and

88
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,789
that that the entire code is on these

89
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:47,380
embedded systems and this takes the

90
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:50,570
decisions it takes it runs the entire

91
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,440
vehicle as well and or rather we can say

92
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:57,440
vehicle communications so this is if you

93
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,669
see these are the internal things if we

94
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,949
if we go from higher-end you can say the

95
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,070
cars so you'll see the Lord of beasts

96
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:10,639
uses inside the cars and if you talk

97
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,889
about the smart car rather smart any

98
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,500
smart card you will see more than 200

99
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:19,099
issues inside the car so you can say so

100
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,460
if you compare the entire the line

101
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:25,430
number of the line code lines with if

102
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,690
you compare to Facebook it's it's it's

103
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,810
so bigger right

104
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,479
so it it's in obedience billions lines

105
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,210
of codes inside the ECU itself so it's a

106
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,440
huge complex technology you can see in

107
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:41,810
the in the car so this is what these

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,139
some sort of features and the associated

109
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,349
features comes with the comes as well

110
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,180
the matter management fuel and internal

111
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,669
composition injection hybrid motor

112
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,220
controls these are a ton of things you

113
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,760
can see in the in the cars as of now so

114
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,389
it may be a smart car electric car

115
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:05,960
autonomous car anything so these are the

116
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:08,690
these some some kind of you know these

117
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,190
sensors or the features inside the you

118
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:16,010
can say vehicles so if you see the the

119
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,169
protocol so if I do the requirements

120
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,229
versus the data rate so the speed you

121
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:24,020
can see the Lin can then flex day so if

122
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:26,719
you see the Lin protocol it's a one wire

123
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,000
protocol and the data rate would be a

124
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,099
very less and the requirement also is a

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,169
race in the market so if we compare with

126
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,979
the canvas so you will see the most of

127
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,479
the curve

128
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,550
stop the cars works on the canvas as

129
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,280
well so now the current canvas cometh

130
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,640
comes with the Ethernet communication as

131
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,489
well

132
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,919
flex raise again the data speed is very

133
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:50,120
high as compared to the Lin and the

134
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,090
canvas protocols so if I talk about the

135
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,030
the can burst this it's nothing but

136
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,280
controller area network you can see

137
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,520
those particular canvas you can see and

138
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,830
different vehicles they have extended

139
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,409
protocols as well based on the the

140
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,159
canvas as well so it's a two wire

141
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,250
communications can high and can low I

142
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,650
shown you some obd2 connectors they have

143
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,320
14 number which can low and the footer 6

144
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,049
pin numbers can high so it also supports

145
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,890
the obd2 connectors and it works on the

146
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:27,320
differential signaling so you can see

147
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,180
these are the signals which represents

148
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,210
can high and can low and if you if we

149
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,280
see the arbitration ID and dlc in data

150
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:40,070
and as here so these are this packet

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:42,380
structure so the canvas has canvas 2.0

152
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,409
as the two types like canvas 2.0 a and b

153
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,180
so difference is the arbitration ID so

154
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,360
if we talk about the canvas a is nothing

155
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:55,880
but element bit and if we talk about the

156
00:07:50,360 --> 00:08:00,350
canvas 2.0 B it's a 29 bit identifier so

157
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:03,290
this is the how the data packet and so

158
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,780
it's it's a can extended protocols have

159
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,970
some applies OTP protocols some kind of

160
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,309
transport protocols can open it's

161
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,290
another kind of canvas open source

162
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,510
protocol you can see in a different

163
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:17,330
automation sectors industrial control

164
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,880
systems so and in the robotics as well

165
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:24,140
some cameras they use canvas can open

166
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,480
protocol GM LAN is another the protocol

167
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:30,080
which it's kind of the propriety

168
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,690
protocol from gender motor a CIJ one

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,059
eight five zero protocol PWM and key

170
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,979
keywords protocol and ISO nine one four

171
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,219
own these are the different kind of the

172
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:43,700
protocols which is again extended

173
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:46,520
extension of the canvas protocol so if I

174
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,460
compare to obd2 here we talked about the

175
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,069
can high and

176
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,570
there's a six and a fourteen pin number

177
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,490
and if you compare with the halls

178
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,060
extender protocol you can see that they

179
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,580
the every every pin has a different

180
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,380
meanings or rather you can say different

181
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:07,230
definitions or other pin ID so you can

182
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:10,200
say so what kind of what kind of attacks

183
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,550
you can do on the canvas first we we do

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,900
a DOS attack so how what exactly when

185
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,510
happens when you sniff the entire

186
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,640
communications with respect to Oh buddy

187
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,569
- or rather if you attach those hardware

188
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,240
which is which can transfer receive the

189
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,250
can message with the ECU as well you

190
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,930
will see lot up come a lot of messages

191
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:37,560
so the identifiers the arbitration ID it

192
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:41,579
should be less if it is less that means

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:45,239
the message is associated with that ID

194
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,640
is it's on higher priority so you can

195
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,450
see the breaks breaks and other

196
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,970
sensitive you know functions or events

197
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:58,140
has a arbitration lady is a very low so

198
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:00,500
if if if the indicator shows to two

199
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,120
hundred or other to forty when I had

200
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,690
arbitration ID so if you see the brick

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,840
has a arbitration ID like a 50 so 50

202
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,350
would be the high priority message in

203
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,700
the canvas so canvas is like

204
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,010
broadcasting message when it when it

205
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,080
saints masses it broadcast the entire

206
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,569
message to the canvas network so

207
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,280
whenever it comes to the particular

208
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,320
message ID or rather identifier it

209
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,470
listens and give the gives the response

210
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,550
based on the or rather gives the events

211
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:35,520
based on the message so once you know

212
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:42,870
the arbitration ID and in DLC if you see

213
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:45,030
send 0 0 0 8 byte the 0 0 information or

214
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,800
other data so it creates a toss on that

215
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,890
particular atom position ID so these

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,660
kind of attacks we can do fire rose is

217
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:56,460
nothing but once you snip the entire

218
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,430
communication and if you see the

219
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,249
timestamp between

220
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:06,550
the two consecutive messages it would be

221
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:09,529
always less it would be a particularly

222
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,160
the time and if you send those messages

223
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:15,559
within less time like if it is two

224
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,610
seconds and we are sending or one second

225
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:22,129
on so it will be the fire rose attack as

226
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,529
well packet payload modification you can

227
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:27,860
do a lot of payload modification on the

228
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:31,279
DLC itself packet replay attacks

229
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,139
so again if you dump the entire

230
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,079
communication and you can replay it and

231
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:39,170
you can see the same effect on the

232
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,269
particular issue as well right after

233
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:45,050
right before is a those kind of attacks

234
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,850
when we you send the valid message and

235
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,529
after that you send the malicious

236
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,370
message and you can see the difference

237
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:54,139
on the what what's the the attack or

238
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,870
other response on the particular issue

239
00:11:54,139 --> 00:12:00,680
or rather in the car as well and again

240
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:04,009
if you send the malicious message and

241
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,929
after that you send the the valid

242
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,029
message you can see the difference but

243
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:10,579
specifically when we do the testing of

244
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,490
the gateways or other switches in the

245
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:19,189
cars so these kind of attacks you can do

246
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:22,910
in testing those things so next is a Lin

247
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:27,529
network so Nikhil will tell you about

248
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:29,959
the okay thanks Arun he try to explain

249
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,559
about can and now I'll try to explain

250
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,248
about the lean protocol how it works

251
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:39,649
we'll start with the lean network yeah

252
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:42,139
basically lean is the master slave type

253
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:44,449
of communication you will see that there

254
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:47,509
are some arrows going on on this bus

255
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:49,339
let's ignore the first thing here there

256
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,490
are two arrows but let's see that the

257
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:56,689
master sends information on the bus okay

258
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,209
so what it sends it sends ID and then it

259
00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,980
goes to all the slaves like slave one

260
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:03,739
slave - you see these arrows are going

261
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:08,179
there and then this ID

262
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:10,610
whoever slaves match this slave will

263
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,649
respond to it so it is transmitting from

264
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,990
here and go

265
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:23,949
to the all other basically we can say to

266
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:26,529
the notes okay okay yeah so now we

267
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:29,469
understood that how this basically the

268
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:32,379
NATO walks and we'll go a little bit

269
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,319
detail inside it so master sends the ID

270
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:37,689
on the bus so you see the idea is

271
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:39,670
reflecting on the bus here and the slave

272
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:41,618
one responds the eight byte of

273
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,618
information after that okay

274
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:46,749
and the Cu stands for the checksum it's

275
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:49,629
also Sciences checksum and if you see

276
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:53,649
the bus how it looked like is there is

277
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:57,069
ID and eight byte of data plus checksum

278
00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:00,759
okay so this is how the Lane frame has

279
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:04,300
been made how this link scheduler works

280
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,730
so master sends the IDS with a

281
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,420
particular frequency so let's say this

282
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:13,809
is a 55 ID it's sent and the slave one

283
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:17,019
responded with 55 a data length of eight

284
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:21,279
and with the checksum for a slave to

285
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:24,730
there the ID is zero four and you'll see

286
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,649
that the data is or or sent by them on

287
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,519
the bus how it looked like it looked

288
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:33,819
like that there is a 55 ID and the data

289
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,040
and zero four and basically the data but

290
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,959
we don't understand from where this data

291
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,389
came from is it transmitted by the

292
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,429
master or is it transmitted by slave 1

293
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:45,220
or slave - this is not possible to

294
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:48,009
distinguish somehow and that that's the

295
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,410
advantage that Acker can take here okay

296
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,959
so we'll see some slides over after this

297
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,029
slide how the attacker can take the

298
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,638
advantage of it this is one more thing

299
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:59,379
which it's it's like you you're allowed

300
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,829
to send the master is allowed to send

301
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:05,170
any ID on its bus it's basically decided

302
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:07,479
based on how frequently this information

303
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:11,439
is going to be used and that's why I

304
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,809
just wanted to make one additional thing

305
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,089
like the master can send one more zero

306
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:21,670
for ID and then the slave to respond to

307
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:24,309
this ID okay so as I discussed earlier

308
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,089
that what are the problem on the bus is

309
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,430
that we could

310
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,579
unable to understand who is sending

311
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,729
which data so that's the advantage the

312
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:37,149
attacker can take over so Master census

313
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,680
ID okay it goes to all the slaves let's

314
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,839
say one of the slave is the attacking

315
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,229
slave okay so what it does

316
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:48,399
immediately after sending a master ID it

317
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:51,639
sends the information on the first byte

318
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,220
of data data and what will happen in

319
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,980
this case is the collision there is a

320
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:01,649
important thing in this type of

321
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:05,860
communication if slave one sends

322
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:08,379
positive of one on the bus and attacking

323
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,410
slave sands zero on the bus

324
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:14,709
the zero wins in this case and continues

325
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,879
to transmit the data we will see here

326
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,189
how it happens

327
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:21,399
so there is a master here which is

328
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:23,980
sending 55 ID slave one trying to send

329
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,189
the information eight zero so it zero

330
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,559
means one zero zero zero zero zero if we

331
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:33,279
convert into the binary format and then

332
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,790
the attacking slave so it's somehow not

333
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,679
visible yeah but it's attacking slave is

334
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,670
sending zero information where he wanted

335
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:45,399
to make the other slave to stop its data

336
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:49,599
after say after if you remember that

337
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:52,179
there is a slide I've shown you it also

338
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,439
receives the information so whatever he

339
00:16:52,179 --> 00:17:00,759
puts on the bus it also receives it and

340
00:16:55,439 --> 00:17:03,910
in this collision he the slave one will

341
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,429
understand that the attacker are not

342
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,129
basically an attack but this level will

343
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:12,640
understand that there is a problem on

344
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,949
the bus maybe it's a fault and it will

345
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,049
stop sending the information what the

346
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:20,319
attacker slave now can send the data

347
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:23,648
whatever it wants after that part and in

348
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,260
the on the bus it is like no fault

349
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:28,629
normal message has been seen by the

350
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,370
other slaves so if the slave one is

351
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:34,750
trying to send information to the slave

352
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,459
three or four it's like first byte you

353
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,830
cannot do anything the attacker cannot

354
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,559
do anything but the other bytes

355
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:45,428
of information he can manipulate and

356
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:49,269
change in defeat functionality can occur

357
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:51,220
in the other slaves okay so this is

358
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,830
about the slave attack he can do it

359
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,590
there is other possibility a lean master

360
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,049
attack also so if the master is

361
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,779
basically controlling the whole network

362
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,658
sending the different IDs on the bus but

363
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:07,450
if the attack is you it can be a slave

364
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:11,409
ECU as well or on any any node connected

365
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,510
to rate just sends just garbage value or

366
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:16,120
zero zero zero or something like this

367
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,460
the master could not able to send the

368
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,889
information on the bus which results

369
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,940
into something like this that it sends

370
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:27,070
five five on the bus but nothing on the

371
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,230
bus it's zero and everybody recognize

372
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,960
that there is a problem in the bus so

373
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,799
it's against our try it after some time

374
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,860
and check if this is fine still you will

375
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,710
see that the bus is zero it attempts for

376
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,469
some time after a few attempts the

377
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,380
master goes to a state which is called

378
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,419
as error state and stop sending this

379
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,090
information and the next thing what will

380
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:54,760
come up is this attacking you will

381
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,799
become a master and try to control the

382
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,658
whole network so these are the two types

383
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,418
of possible lean attacks are how we try

384
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:07,029
to do a select this information we use

385
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:12,130
one of the device from microchip it's

386
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:13,809
quite cheap around 30 or $40 can

387
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,840
analyzer you can get it from there and

388
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,460
it gives you the data information so I

389
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,158
just try to show you how we try to

390
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:26,440
analyze it it also shows the checksum or

391
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:30,399
yeah okay and this is we tried when lean

392
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,519
attack on a slave this was the data sent

393
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:38,889
by one of the slave this this is the

394
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:41,110
data okay and now the same IDs been sent

395
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:45,610
by the master now the attacking issue

396
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:48,719
has made zero zero on the first byte of

397
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:51,879
the data first byte and the other bytes

398
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,210
the attacking is you can send whatever

399
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,669
you

400
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,830
want so we just said to send as a one

401
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:59,350
two three four five six seven and the

402
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,619
calculation of the checksum is also been

403
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:06,009
calculated by the attacking issue and

404
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:08,379
send out the bus so these are the basic

405
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,990
threats so we see that on the lean bus

406
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:14,080
it can occur

407
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,149
okay the next about the tools are one

408
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,658
will take over on it we understood the

409
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:22,119
canvas and leaned the only the thing is

410
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:24,730
so what kind of devices we used for you

411
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:27,279
know attacking Lin's lint protocol and

412
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,240
the canvas protocol so value can three

413
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,940
so one of the tool which is commercial

414
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,059
for interpret and it's cost around I

415
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:41,740
think so three to four hundred dollar

416
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:43,840
and the the the software also vehicle

417
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,649
spy is costly it's more than two hundred

418
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,019
two thousand dollars as well so you can

419
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:54,369
use the u.s. between us based in its

420
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:56,399
cost around the 35 euros you can search

421
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:59,678
for us between you will you will see the

422
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:02,350
this sketch you can print those PCB

423
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,029
boots and you can buy those chipsets is

424
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,459
these chips is nothing but from the

425
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:09,039
microchip and you can solder and you can

426
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,110
start working on the canvas as well so

427
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,279
there is another called as you can can

428
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:18,998
triple the same they use a you know

429
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:22,330
microchip microchip chipset and they it

430
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:26,470
use can socket utility in the Linux as

431
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:29,870
well there is a very nice tool can

432
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,960
badger it so again open-source tool and

433
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,909
these are these are the both guys good

434
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,730
guys from the who made the can batchers

435
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:41,810
for D and Harvey and they have the tool

436
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:47,390
and if you see the bomb so it's like it

437
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:50,720
used to db9 cables one SD cards and it's

438
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,460
like a bob suit style tool you can

439
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,430
intercept the communication and can't

440
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:58,550
replayed even you can change the message

441
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,560
on the fly and you can first ECU as well

442
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:04,490
with the help of you DS packets and you

443
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:09,070
can dump the firmware from from the ECU

444
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:12,200
as well and the assembly cost is around

445
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:15,110
$25 so if you take the entire bomb so it

446
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,330
will cost around $100 and it's very good

447
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,490
for a man-in-the-middle attack on the

448
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,970
canvas as well because it it supports

449
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:26,600
two db9 cable so you need to have to

450
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,270
have the db9 - Oh buddy - converter

451
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,240
rather you can say the cables and you

452
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,100
just attach over here and you can start

453
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,970
intercepting the communication and it

454
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,699
can do a lot of ton of things can tools

455
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,440
again the Russian guys they made tool

456
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,010
very nice tool it's written in the

457
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,010
Python QT and Python programming

458
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,350
language and it supports us between

459
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,700
triple and a lot of open source tools

460
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:58,850
you can use it based on the can

461
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:01,370
util-linux utility and very nice tool

462
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:05,149
and you can use for fuzzing as well for

463
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:07,479
lint protocol you can there are

464
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,190
different kind of vendors in the in the

465
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,350
market as well you can check for the

466
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,120
vectors we can check for the interpret

467
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,990
tools which supports lint protocol as

468
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,209
well so for for very cheap things it's

469
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,020
like it's it's cost-effective it comes

470
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:27,980
in twenty five to thirty dollars and

471
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:31,460
it's the software is also open source is

472
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,590
free editions so we call it as a Lin

473
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,370
serial analyzer so you can intercept all

474
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:41,120
the communications of the lint protocol

475
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:43,459
and you can do ton of things so this is

476
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,290
the main topic over here so why we

477
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,780
understood the canvas and the lint

478
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,730
protocols because we should come up with

479
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,570
something call it the anomaly detection

480
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:55,220
systems which can detect all type of the

481
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,550
attacks associated with the line' as

482
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:02,660
well as the canvas so this is how the

483
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:06,110
actual flow of expected can message flow

484
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,910
and the actual canvas can message flow

485
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,219
so nothing but we understood the entire

486
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,320
the communication vehicle communication

487
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:17,270
understand it and we start analyzing

488
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,419
based on this some algorithms we can see

489
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:25,879
we will see in the next slides and it

490
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:28,430
shows the alerts as well so why we will

491
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,990
require those kind of technologies

492
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,630
anomaly detection system so if we come

493
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,970
compared with the IT its intrusion

494
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,230
detection system is the same as

495
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,380
unemployed detection systems based on

496
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,300
the packet patterns and some sort of

497
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,000
different kind of algorithms which are

498
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:47,060
sociated with can canvass and the link

499
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,930
so it's easy to add off in the existing

500
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:54,050
can Network so it may be if we come up

501
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:57,470
with the libraries you can give it to

502
00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:01,190
the tier 1 or tier 2 so they can embed

503
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:06,050
the entire EDS library with ECU and it

504
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:09,110
can they can make edits as well so it's

505
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,419
really adapt really easy to adapt and if

506
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,600
you come up with a hardware you can put

507
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:18,250
in network and start detecting those

508
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:22,459
attacks as well so it's a low cost and

509
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:27,040
it's like when it comes to the ECU

510
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:30,350
modification it's easy to use that so

511
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,460
can network so Nicola will tell you the

512
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:40,010
entire how we can go with EDS with a

513
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:43,790
campus ok thanks ok now we come in the

514
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:47,120
mitigation part started from our own

515
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:49,879
side so this is a basically network in

516
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,129
the canvas how it connects so it has

517
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,990
different issues and anybody can send

518
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,390
the data on the bus and

519
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,690
our needs the data can read the

520
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:02,360
information from the packets okay so how

521
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,789
we can connect ideas areas is easy to

522
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,100
connect just connect one of the node on

523
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:09,140
the bus this is one possibility of the

524
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,299
ideas there are many possibilities you

525
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,370
can integrate into one of the ECU this

526
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,168
is also possible or you can integrate in

527
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,299
all the issues that is also possible

528
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:20,720
so eds is nothing but an algorithm to

529
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:25,039
detect if any intrusion is occur in your

530
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:28,159
network or not okay so let's see what

531
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,580
are the types of ideas of methodologies

532
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,010
are there we can detect before we go

533
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,220
forward we will try to understand how

534
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,840
this can actually transmit on the in

535
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,539
terms of timing we have seen that the

536
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,000
messages are going on on the bus but how

537
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,440
it goes so he's used we in the

538
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,450
automotive world we call as an

539
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,120
electronic control unit so any

540
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,039
electronic control unit which has a

541
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,959
capability to send the canned messages

542
00:26:52,039 --> 00:27:00,110
generally they send or with packets with

543
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,980
some time interval so they don't

544
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:06,020
generally send like an event bus if you

545
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,330
turn on the lights at that time one

546
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,139
packet is sent it's not like that every

547
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:14,600
time every 100 milliseconds or 500

548
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,090
milliseconds or 1 seconds these packets

549
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,629
are sent by an issue so if you say me

550
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:23,029
how many really such issues are there

551
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,070
those are sending frequently messages I

552
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:29,570
would say more than 90 issues out there

553
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:32,168
and maybe it will be more than 90 also

554
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:35,450
in the coming years

555
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:39,919
ok so easy one is sending the message

556
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:42,559
with an interval of 1 second easy to is

557
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,190
sending a message with an interval of

558
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,309
500 milliseconds and then ECU 3 sending

559
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,169
a message with 250 milliseconds so this

560
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:54,049
is generally the canned transmission is

561
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:56,529
done ok whenever there is a collision so

562
00:27:54,049 --> 00:28:00,408
if you see that the packet 0 3 and 0 5

563
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:03,770
will have a collision but it somehow has

564
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:07,580
a resolution without impacting the

565
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:10,610
packet format so if if this is a

566
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,770
zero three zero five collide you will

567
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,740
get 0-3 as a precedence generally though

568
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:18,920
the zeros are in the can and the lean

569
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,320
network passes the gets the access to

570
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,870
the bus and immediately after zero three

571
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,950
you will receive the zero five can be

572
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:32,989
retransmitted okay so how we can detect

573
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:36,470
the if there is an intrusion occur so

574
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:39,860
one way is to check how frequently these

575
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:42,680
packets are going on on the bus so as I

576
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:46,550
stated earlier many is use sending this

577
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:49,010
information frequently so one possible

578
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,710
ways you check how frequently is this

579
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,440
message message are coming and if there

580
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,600
are let's say we can keep a window

581
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,540
something like this and if it goes

582
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,179
beyond some window then say that this

583
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:05,710
packet is somehow not been sent by and

584
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:08,080
legitimate miss issue but some intruded

585
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,670
from another issue which has been

586
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,379
sending this message our attack is you

587
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:17,540
basically okay so this is one type of

588
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,490
method we can apply there are many so

589
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,010
this is another type of method you can

590
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:24,110
apply you can filter out the messages

591
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,940
those are not expected

592
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,979
generally the to carry out the dos

593
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:32,300
attack fuzzing or something like this

594
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:35,360
the of the attacker uses the messages

595
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:37,310
which are with a very high priority so

596
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,040
zero has the highest priority on the bus

597
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,800
so if somebody transmit a zero message

598
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,710
on the bus nobody gets access to the bus

599
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,430
so he can keep on transmitting and lead

600
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:53,150
to a dos attack so no none of these you

601
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:56,360
can able to send it to packets and

602
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,040
receive the appropriate information one

603
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,080
way is that you filter it out if we

604
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,750
check that so you will say okay we

605
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:07,010
understood that this attack is occur

606
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:09,620
what to do with that the car is more not

607
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,360
like an IT systems are where you have

608
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,639
some warning system or something like

609
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,639
this you're driving at 200 kilometer per

610
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,280
hour and the bus is not working is not

611
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,090
good idea so automatic Easy's are

612
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,149
somehow embedded with

613
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,300
software included that they whenever

614
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,940
something happens which is not usual

615
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,639
like the messages are not coming it goes

616
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,180
into the safe state and which indirectly

617
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:40,050
turns into a safe more car so maybe you

618
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:43,050
have a automatic car and then you you

619
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:45,060
want to operate of steering will maybe

620
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,460
the messages are not coming it will

621
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,679
convert that into power sharing to a

622
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,250
normal steering but it will not impact

623
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,320
like staring really of moving on the

624
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:58,410
left side or moving on the right side it

625
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:02,460
doesn't do like that so this is another

626
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:04,680
type this is a third type of possibility

627
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,500
so all these methods we try to apply on

628
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,030
the ideas he's on the protocol level not

629
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,300
on the function level so there are areas

630
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:15,840
comes with the functional levels as well

631
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:18,210
but these are easy to implement so what

632
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,879
it does it checks what the earlier

633
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,830
message was there and what will be the

634
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,220
what is the current one and based on

635
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,230
that it decides so it has to learn all

636
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,480
this information that what was earlier

637
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,550
came and then what is the current one

638
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,960
and then it keeps this sequence

639
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:40,800
stored in in the memory in the learning

640
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,840
phase and well there is an actual

641
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,320
execution going on in the car at that

642
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,240
time it checks if this equipments are

643
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,790
actually repeating or not so you will be

644
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,160
in doubt ok the sequence might have a

645
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:55,500
problem it might work some time it might

646
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,050
not work some time yes you're right it

647
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,870
might work and might not work and can

648
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,200
give a false positive that's why this is

649
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:06,540
not generally directly read and kept you

650
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,000
check the probability how frequently the

651
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,770
sequence comes and based on that you can

652
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,230
reduce the false positive and this is

653
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:18,180
how well the automotive world is

654
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:20,460
thinking about ok one more important

655
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,700
thing we all talked about lot of things

656
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,680
on the network buses but it's not so

657
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,920
easy that you analyze all this

658
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,820
information and that's why many people

659
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:35,040
nowadays are using AI method to read and

660
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,550
understand how this is work

661
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,260
they drive the car maybe for a month or

662
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,260
something like this in a different

663
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,290
situation they get this information from

664
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,510
the network store or there and then in

665
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:52,139
the execution phase the stay store

666
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:56,490
information somehow is used for

667
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,920
algorithm which can able to detect such

668
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,620
a type of intrusion and to reduce the

669
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,470
more the false positive like we already

670
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,409
know about the autonomous driving we use

671
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,240
the AR technology to understand the

672
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,250
different situation and we need to do

673
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,520
something like that for the areas as

674
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:18,240
well that's that so somehow to reduce

675
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:20,760
the false positive on it ok so we have

676
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,660
seen the the type of ideas we can use

677
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,520
for the can one but now for the lane

678
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,070
it's different because there is only one

679
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,970
master which controls it and how to do

680
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:35,760
that the sequence is also fixed ok but

681
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:38,700
what we can do or them so we had a

682
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,010
proposal that we have done two

683
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,590
possibilities here we can do we can

684
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,450
check the range of the data ok I can

685
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,030
understand that this will not definitely

686
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:51,060
solve our problem also we can do

687
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,370
encryption there but we we also thinking

688
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,460
about checking the transition data this

689
00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:00,979
is still make a little bit difficulty

690
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:04,560
for a person or for attacker to get this

691
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,570
transition data because om generally

692
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,330
don't share the functional information

693
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:13,350
on AB network how it works that's that's

694
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:15,540
what we think we are working on link

695
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,759
still of work is not been finished and

696
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,050
we have we are thinking of different

697
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,520
methods to be used for the lean as well

698
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,429
ok now

699
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,870
Haroon will show the demo which we have

700
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:34,399
done in our lab so this is our anomaly

701
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:39,029
detection system and how it works

702
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:43,219
Haroon will explain so what exactly can

703
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:46,470
you can you posit what we try to do is

704
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,319
yeah yeah that LED is blinking or iam so

705
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,328
what we did is in the

706
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:52,730
we have two E's use so we stated

707
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:55,369
electronic control unit the LED blinking

708
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:58,460
is it's switch it's somehow saying that

709
00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:01,700
whatever is coming on the canvas is all

710
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,789
his problem so what we did is we press

711
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,460
that button and it learns that whatever

712
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:10,789
message is going on the bus is the

713
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,910
legend metric messages now you see the

714
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:15,549
speed transmission issue is sending an

715
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,799
information on the instrument cluster

716
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:21,710
you can see the speed is increasing it

717
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:24,170
goes till 180 degree or 180 kilometers

718
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,200
per hour and you can see this the burst

719
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:31,160
information the data we are sniffing

720
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:36,078
from it now what we did if you see if

721
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:40,940
you go back a little bit yeah so now we

722
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:44,900
are trying to spoof a message which can

723
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:49,309
change the speed okay we can we can

724
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,430
start that yes and now you see we use

725
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:54,859
this windows you see that the speed is

726
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,200
changing it's not taking the information

727
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:59,480
only from the speed transmission issue

728
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,430
and I normally detection system over

729
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,839
here so you see that the anomaly she

730
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:08,868
easy is capable enough to detect if any

731
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,328
speed any malicious messages are coming

732
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,359
so if you see earlier aronia has

733
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:17,089
explained the packet has the ID it has

734
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:19,819
the data and the checksum the same

735
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:21,740
packet who transmitted on the bus could

736
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:23,930
not be identified but such a type of

737
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:28,970
anomaly detection system can able to

738
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:33,230
detect the the sequences the filters and

739
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:38,379
maybe a different kind of algorithm can

740
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,380
detect such a type of attacks
