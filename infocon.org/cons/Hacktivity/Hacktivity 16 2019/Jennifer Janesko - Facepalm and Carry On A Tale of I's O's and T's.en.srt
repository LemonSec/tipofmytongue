1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,449
so good afternoon everyone welcome back

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,629
after lunch

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:09,149
I hope that you are digesting well I'd

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,099
like you to take relax and I'm gonna

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,940
talk to you today about a syndrome that

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,640
I like to call facepalm and carry on

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,259
insecurity now before I get started I

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,980
need to tell you a little bit about

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,350
myself

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,320
I've worked on i.t for over 20 years and

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,680
about 10 years ago I took a few applied

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,380
cryptography courses and I learned

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,450
security is really cool so I decided to

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,690
make the switch and I've been working in

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,940
security for about six years now and

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:42,390
today I'm going to tell you a tale of

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,040
ice oats and teas now if you're sitting

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,649
in this audience you probably know what

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,750
that means I'm gonna be talking to you

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,180
about Star Trek The Next Generation and

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,840
the Starship Enterprise

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,010
using IOT to boldly go where no man has

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,770
gone before

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,690
so what I mean by this I started

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,870
watching Star Trek The Next Generation a

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,720
really old television show this summer

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,780
and I started noticing that the Star

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,729
Trek Enterprise uses a ton of internet

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,600
of things there are things like

30
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,850
replicators warp drives computer oh you

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,919
say computer and the computer listens

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,199
and then you tell it what to do there's

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720
the transporter the holodeck there's

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,790
cloaking devices the medical bay where

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,039
dr. crusher just magically waves the

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,460
device over the patient and then you

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,920
instantly know what the diagnosis is

38
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,939
there is the ultimate interconnected

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,860
implant society called the Borg and

40
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:44,100
finally we have our very most favorite

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,020
Android in all of the world data now

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,789
when I say a Star Trek is there anyone

43
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,720
here who doesn't know what I'm talking

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,729
about okay I had I see absolutely no

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,189
hands in the audience so I'm going to go

46
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,329
on the assumption that we can assume we

47
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,110
all know about Star Trek and move on

48
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,059
and so I'm going to tell you about

49
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,219
Internet of Things now in your if you're

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,190
in this audience again I know you know

51
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,810
what IOT is but for the sake of this

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,480
presentation I'm going to cover

53
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,470
basically the architecture so that we're

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,190
all on the same

55
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,200
for this presentation essentially IOT is

56
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,570
comprised of three different levels you

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,850
have the bottom level which is basically

58
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,380
the dum level this is a level where you

59
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,090
have devices that are collecting

60
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,650
information about the environment or

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,590
giving commands in order to control the

62
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,900
environment in the middle level you have

63
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,300
your apps and you have your gateways and

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,220
you have your edge computing devices

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,350
these devices collect information

66
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,240
process the information maybe lightly

67
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,510
and ultimately they send that

68
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,380
information into the cloud in the cloud

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,390
there are three three responsibilities

70
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,760
there is a data analysis that can go on

71
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,410
their service configuration where you

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,140
can actually configure devices to work

73
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,870
the way that you want to and if you're

74
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:05,570
lucky you get over-the-air updates and

75
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:09,780
so this is IOT and the question is are

76
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:13,019
we building in security to a level such

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,410
that we can drive a starship through

78
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,959
there through the universe and actually

79
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,870
be confident that we're not going to be

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,630
hacked and so to talk about this I'm

81
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,120
going to talk about three security fails

82
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:31,290
that we've seen in the past year with

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,080
respect to IOT the first one has to do

84
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,880
with Captain jean-luc Picard he was

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,590
really into drinking tea when he was

86
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,109
thinking about problems on the Starship

87
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,940
Enterprise and in order to get that cup

88
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,800
of tea he would go to the computer

89
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,440
replicator and say tea Earl Grey hot and

90
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,320
then the replicator would create the cup

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,000
of tea and he would sip it now today we

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,900
don't have replicators to create our

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,280
cups of tea but we do have I Oh tea tea

94
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,440
kettles and in hackable podcast from

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,019
just a few months ago they pitted IOT

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,300
tea of kettles against IOT coffee makers

97
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,370
to see which would be the most hackable

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,150
I'm not going to tell you which one won

99
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:18,390
but what the hackers were able to do was

100
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,269
to disassociate the tea kettle from the

101
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,159
wireless network then they were able to

102
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,830
force the tea kettle to associate to

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,419
their rogue wireless network

104
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,669
they were they were able to connect to

105
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,150
the configuration interface of the tea

106
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:36,250
kettle steel the wireless password

107
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,989
wireless LAN password from the original

108
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,949
network and then connect to that Network

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,379
and be poised for further attack so in

110
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,840
this case in this hacking instance they

111
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:51,039
were able to be in a local area sort of

112
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,438
way use a typical hack and actually gain

113
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:58,870
access full access to the network which

114
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,740
is very bad my next example has to do

115
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,280
with warp drive

116
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,259
now when the Star Trek Enterprise goes

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,940
into warp drives but it goes really

118
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,460
really fast and it has the possibility

119
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,830
of warp 1 all the way up through warp 10

120
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,270
and once you get past warp 10 then you

121
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,710
run into problems with space-time

122
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,568
continuum but we're not going to talk

123
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,000
about that today we're just gonna talk

124
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,819
about regular warp if you think about it

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,889
if you go really really fast there's no

126
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:27,849
possible way a human can control a

127
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:30,279
starship that way you have to rely on

128
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:32,590
sensors and some sort of positioning in

129
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,469
order to make that work now naturally we

130
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,948
don't have warp yet but we do have

131
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:40,870
positioning systems and so the example

132
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,580
that I'm going to talk about today has

133
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,339
to do with vehicle trackers

134
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,560
so the pentest partner is a company in

135
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,690
the UK did their own research on three

136
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,060
different vehicle trackers now these are

137
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,550
add-ons that you put onto your vehicle

138
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,849
after you purchase it and what it does

139
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,699
is it allows you to track your vehicle

140
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:03,490
in the case that it's stolen well what

141
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:07,120
they did was they investigated the api's

142
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,060
that allowed the car to actually speak

143
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,509
with the cloud-based tracking software

144
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,819
and what they figured out was without

145
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,729
authentication and without authorization

146
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,669
they were able to track other people's

147
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,949
cars in one instance they were actually

148
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:27,128
able to without authentication and

149
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:30,310
without authorization immobilize a car

150
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:32,830
completely that's a problem so in this

151
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,139
case it's no longer a local attack this

152
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,008
is definitely a remote attack and you're

153
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:41,550
actually able to influence things in the

154
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,550
physical world

155
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,820
my third and final example has to do

156
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,060
with smart homes now if you think about

157
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,960
the Star Trek and start Starship

158
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,220
Enterprise it is the ultimate smart home

159
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,080
when you say computer the computer

160
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,940
listens to you and then it does what

161
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,359
you're supposed to do well we have that

162
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,780
today we have smart locks we have smart

163
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,690
thermostats we have smart baby monitors

164
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,510
we have security cameras we have smart

165
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,490
speakers everything is becoming super

166
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,349
smart

167
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,450
the problem with that is and the past

168
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,090
couple or in the past year there have

169
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,490
been more and more reports of attackers

170
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,179
actually connecting to people smart

171
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,230
homes and monitoring them in their homes

172
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,950
talking to them over there smart

173
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,770
speakers in some cases there have been

174
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,630
in some cases that have been reports of

175
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,969
attackers talking to babies and their

176
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,150
baby cribs and monitoring the babies and

177
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,090
their baby cribs another attack vector

178
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,219
is that domestic abusers are now using

179
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,340
these devices to control their victims

180
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,860
so they when the victims are not at home

181
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,289
they turn up the temperature of the

182
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,120
thermostat causing higher costs for

183
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,580
utilities and making it difficult for

184
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,570
people to financially make it they also

185
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,490
have there are also reports of they're

186
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,200
changing the codes for locks so that

187
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,920
people can't get in to their home when

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,020
they come home for work so in this case

189
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,020
it's no longer just security researchers

190
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,950
figuring out the vulnerabilities it's an

191
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:25,510
actual real-life attack interesting in

192
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:28,030
this case - the attacks are you're able

193
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,539
to make these attacks because of weak

194
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,089
passwords so default passwords were used

195
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,550
in those cases weak passwords were used

196
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:41,350
also passwords where people have reuse

197
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:43,959
passwords and other systems now these

198
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,690
are nice anecdotes but what if we have a

199
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,840
study that actually goes across just a

200
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,060
few IOT devices well a company called

201
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,490
cyber ITIL did this and they posted

202
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,619
their results in August 2009

203
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,660
they went online and they downloaded

204
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,750
4,000 plus firmwares

205
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,930
from 22 different vendors from over 15

206
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,000
years and what they did was they looked

207
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,969
for positive signs of security controls

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,460
in that software and what they found was

209
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:17,320
this there were no positive trends

210
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:19,810
across vendors and in fact security

211
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,860
vendors were removing security controls

212
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:27,089
in their software now when I see things

213
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:31,750
like this it makes me just want to

214
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:36,490
facepalm and then carry on IOT security

215
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:39,190
is never or IOT will never be secure IOT

216
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,440
vendors do not want to build security in

217
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,620
it's too expensive it takes too much

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,870
time they have to get things to market

219
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:53,290
but on the other hand we can't do that

220
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,720
IOT is coming it's here and it's only

221
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,160
going to get more complicated I haven't

222
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,820
talked to you about the botnets I

223
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,390
haven't talked to you about the new

224
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,790
implementations with artificial

225
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,730
intelligence the new implementations

226
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,579
with robotics and the potentialities of

227
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:13,120
human brain into our human brain

228
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,270
computer interface we need to get

229
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,520
onboard the Starship Enterprise and go

230
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:25,900
with our IOT friends or we're gonna get

231
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:27,670
left behind so I started thinking about

232
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,060
ok how can I approach this problem

233
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,770
because it's a big problem and for the

234
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,930
past couple of years I've worked in a

235
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:39,030
related field but not in IOT I've worked

236
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:42,219
in operational technology and to me

237
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,620
operational technology is like IOT but

238
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,480
on steroids and there are some

239
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,850
similarities here and I'm bear with me

240
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,880
as I explain what I'm talking about

241
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:55,120
so operational technology controls

242
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,000
really big things and what I mean by

243
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,550
that is manufacturing chemical

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,920
processing electricity generation

245
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,469
transmission and distribution which is

246
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,870
where I've worked water processing oil

247
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,560
and gas distribution

248
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,570
and at the very bottom layer kind of

249
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,359
like you know IOT there are some dumb

250
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,390
devices there are sensors that collect

251
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,830
information and there are field devices

252
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,650
that actually control things like

253
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:26,800
switches and relays in valves at the

254
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:29,579
second layer we have smarter devices but

255
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,920
not super smart devices these are PLC's

256
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,080
IEDs and are to use and they collect the

257
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,640
information from these sensors and they

258
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,779
send information down to the field

259
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,910
devices and then these devices in the

260
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:45,130
middle send the information up to the

261
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,199
smarter systems these are your SCADA

262
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,300
systems your distributed control systems

263
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,820
and these are the systems that prepare

264
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,329
the information and make it consumable

265
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,150
for the operators in the control room

266
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,029
now it used to be that operational

267
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,459
technology was air-gapped it was cut off

268
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,620
there was no connection in in order to

269
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,830
get into the control room you had to

270
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:13,620
walk into the control room but more and

271
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:18,460
more today it's moving towards i io t

272
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,020
industrial IOT and what that means is

273
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,330
there there are more and more

274
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,400
connections into the control room from

275
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,190
the outside so there are remote

276
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,069
connections with VPN for support

277
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,960
personnel there are mobile apps and web

278
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,730
applications so that the business people

279
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,440
can get up-to-date information about the

280
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,780
process network so that they can make

281
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,560
really good business decisions and then

282
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,689
you have cloud yes we're controlling

283
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,209
things with the cloud what could go

284
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:51,190
wrong well what can go wrong if ot is

285
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,010
breached is much much bigger than with

286
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,010
IOT you could have potential big

287
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:01,180
environmental impact death or injury and

288
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:03,459
if you damage equipment with an eye or

289
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,800
with an OT attack you're looking at

290
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:11,500
millions of dollars or euros with of

291
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:15,279
replacement I'm not the first person who

292
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,350
knows this in the early 2000s a bunch of

293
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,970
countries said this is a real problem so

294
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,160
we're going to put some legislation in

295
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,129
place to make sure that

296
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,290
we put security into these into the

297
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,870
operational technology networks so that

298
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,469
we're protected and so for example in

299
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,600
the USA the Energy Policy Act of 2005

300
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,399
was implemented and this required

301
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,310
electric companies in the United States

302
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,060
to adhere to Newark sip standards with

303
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:46,779
which have subsequently become more and

304
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,430
more stringent over time in Europe there

305
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,339
was the European program for critical

306
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,699
infrastructure protection in 2004 and

307
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:56,259
that was introduced in 2004 but really

308
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:58,750
countries has started getting on board

309
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:01,660
very recently and for example in Germany

310
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,730
in 2015 they had an amendment to their

311
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,399
energy sector law which required

312
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,620
companies to start implementing and I

313
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,500
SMS and start implementing security

314
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,560
controls and Singapore just introduced

315
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,750
something new just this year their

316
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,388
operational technology cyber security

317
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,730
master plan I love the name master plan

318
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:26,680
and I'm very curious to see how things

319
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,269
are forced to work in Singapore to

320
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,649
understand the legislation though you

321
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,060
need to understand the different roles

322
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:36,550
within ot and these roles are assets

323
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,939
owner system integrator and product

324
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,949
supplier now an asset owner is like The

325
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:45,189
Electric Company they use a bunch of

326
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:46,599
things to control their network on the

327
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:49,060
right hand side we have our product

328
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,709
suppliers these are people are companies

329
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:58,689
such as ABB Siemens GE these are the

330
00:14:53,709 --> 00:15:01,149
companies that give you the devices that

331
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,130
you can use to control your processes in

332
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,069
your network and then in the middle we

333
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,990
have this funny group called system

334
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:10,029
integrators and these are people who

335
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,970
take requirements from the asset owners

336
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,740
and then they look for the product

337
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,860
suppliers who are going to fulfill the

338
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,569
process needs of the asset owner and so

339
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:24,300
where do you think the legislation

340
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:24,300
placed the responsibility for security

341
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,500
they placed it on the shoulders of the

342
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,570
asset owners and not on the product

343
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,720
suppliers which i think is very

344
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,170
interesting and this has led to a huge

345
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,360
growth of security of products and also

346
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,599
services within the security industry

347
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,490
targeted for ot there are security

348
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,800
audits there's new products for

349
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,560
monitoring new products for access

350
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,310
control and new services for managing

351
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,640
processes and keeping things up to date

352
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:03,849
now is this perfect no are there still

353
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,130
security problems in the area of ot yes

354
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,170
there are lots of things left behind but

355
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,020
we're seeing progress and this is what I

356
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:15,069
would like to see and what I'd like to

357
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,680
continue to see more of so if we map

358
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,900
these roles from ot the asset owner

359
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,400
system integrator and product supplier

360
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,890
on to IOT what can we learn and so I've

361
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,720
broken down IOT into three different

362
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,400
categories because these are categories

363
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,860
that come up over and over and over when

364
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,530
I'm doing research the first is medical

365
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,010
the second is connected vehicle yes our

366
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:44,650
cars are full of IOT too and consumer

367
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:46,660
IOT so in the first case we have medical

368
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,310
devices and the kinds of devices that

369
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,410
I'm talking about right now are

370
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,839
implanted devices that control

371
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,730
physiology in some way or the kinds of

372
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,410
devices that you use to measure your

373
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,000
physiology so you can make decisions

374
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,699
about your health and in the asset owner

375
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,250
category we have just regular old humans

376
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,800
in the system integrator category we

377
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,050
have hospital doctor doctors offices and

378
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,480
medical centers and in the product

379
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,490
suppliers category we have medical

380
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,370
device suppliers and component suppliers

381
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,530
and what's interesting in this case in

382
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,530
medical is that there's movement in the

383
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,089
area of security and for example in the

384
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,209
u.s. there is the Food and Drug

385
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:30,610
Administration they are able to recall

386
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,260
devices if there is a security

387
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,389
vulnerability that they think is

388
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,580
absolutely critical and they've done so

389
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,260
in the past they're also in the process

390
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,379
of putting together requirements for

391
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,320
medical device product suppliers

392
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,290
and that specifies exactly what security

393
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,899
controls need to be in place in order to

394
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,930
be able to sell in the United States now

395
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,630
this hasn't been put into place yet this

396
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,210
document is in review but the goal is to

397
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,100
give something to suppliers so that they

398
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,640
know what the expectations are with

399
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,790
respect to security in the EU there's

400
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,000
the medical devices regulation and that

401
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:14,010
was put into place in 2017 and it has

402
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,310
some cybersecurity components to it and

403
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:21,070
devices need to be compliant with these

404
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:24,129
requirements by 2020 so once again is it

405
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,080
perfect no but it's a start and we're

406
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,090
moving in the right direction so the

407
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:34,570
medical bay could potentially be a

408
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:35,889
reality so what about automotive so once

409
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,060
again we'll start with our three

410
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,800
different categories asset owner humans

411
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,200
system integrator you have auto dealers

412
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,530
service stations relatives and friends

413
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,970
who can actually fix things on your car

414
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:52,200
you also have product suppliers like

415
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:56,440
'omg and the ECU suppliers for the OEMs

416
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,050
an automotive is really interesting

417
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,350
they're not looking for legislation to

418
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:04,510
legislate them the Society of Automotive

419
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,610
Engineers has put together a work group

420
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,290
of representatives across the industry

421
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,469
and they're developing their own

422
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:15,120
cybersecurity standard so this is the

423
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:18,940
the proposed standard is Oh 2 1 4 3 4

424
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,449
and it is slated to be ratified in 2020

425
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,150
so it looks like the automotive people

426
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,640
have their stuff together and they're

427
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,920
moving in the direction of security now

428
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,600
it's not legislation so it's going to be

429
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,700
really interesting to see what happens

430
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,010
once this is actually read it ratified

431
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:42,070
and put into place what the automakers

432
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:45,850
are going to do and now we're back down

433
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:47,830
to the level of consumer IT these are

434
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,080
your smart homes these are the things

435
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,389
that you add on to your cars after you

436
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,260
purchase them these are your smart

437
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,090
teakettles what do we have here

438
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:02,860
in the asset owner once again we have

439
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:05,260
humans in system integrator there is no

440
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,419
formal system integrator here you have

441
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,570
package instructions you have YouTube

442
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,910
kora Stack Overflow people find

443
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,740
information to get things to work in

444
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,980
their homes in the most unconventional

445
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,290
ways and then you have your products of

446
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:26,020
layers which are your IOT device makers

447
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:27,520
your component suppliers and so let's

448
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,290
think about the different ways that we

449
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,510
could legislate the first thing that we

450
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:34,330
had within ot was legislating the asset

451
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:38,170
owners meet your asset owners this is

452
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,929
Sally and Jim Jim is retired he likes to

453
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:44,230
watch YouTube on his Roku device Sally

454
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:46,390
rooted her first tablet at the age of 65

455
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,550
and she has at least six devices

456
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,440
connected to her network at home at all

457
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,450
times by the way she's leading network

458
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,910
administrator of the house but really

459
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,850
what she likes to do is hang out with

460
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,220
her grand grand kids she doesn't really

461
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,770
like futzing with the technical things

462
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,640
are we going to force them to implement

463
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:09,490
an AI SMS are we going to find them if

464
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:13,810
they're not compliant No so we're gonna

465
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:15,640
move on what about legislation for

466
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,830
product suppliers like in the medical

467
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,430
IOT device rate realm

468
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,649
let's look we actually have an existing

469
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,020
piece of legislation people this is in

470
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:30,280
California in the United States they

471
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:34,540
passed a bill that the SB 327 and is

472
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:38,170
going to go into effect in 2020 is it

473
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,780
going to work my prediction is probably

474
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,570
not there's been a lot of criticism of

475
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,910
this bill and that has a lot of good

476
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:49,750
intention but it's not specific enough

477
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,510
for product suppliers to be of any use

478
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,880
and so if there is some sort of court

479
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,330
case that that goes on with this

480
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,920
particular law we're going to see the

481
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:06,610
courts struggle to enforce it we also

482
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,440
have some proposed legislation in the US

483
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,540
there's a House bill once

484
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,780
six-eight this is a bill that would

485
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,280
require any IOT product suppliers that

486
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,340
want to do business with the US

487
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,080
government to actually adhere to a set

488
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,350
of NIST standards which are currently

489
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,330
under construction in the UK they've put

490
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,169
together a code of practice for consumer

491
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:32,110
IOT security and it's a really explicit

492
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:35,500
nice list of security controls for IOT

493
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,449
product suppliers the problem is they

494
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,370
don't know exactly which controls they

495
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,130
want to make mandatory because of

496
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:45,090
reasons I'll talk about in a minute and

497
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:47,680
then in Germany after the Mirai botnet

498
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,189
problem which knocked out my telephone

499
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,980
for two full days the German government

500
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,480
or the BSI which is a part of the German

501
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,870
government put together about router

502
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,090
security security control lists and it

503
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,100
was really it's really nice so if you go

504
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,459
and read it you're like yeah you're

505
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:09,149
thinking about security here it's not or

506
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,250
it looks like it could be enforced but

507
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,680
over time talk about that has gone away

508
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,260
so I don't know what what is going to

509
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,920
happen here what's the problem with

510
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,780
legislation why is it so hard well the

511
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,400
four things that I've seen over and over

512
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,620
again by looking at the different pieces

513
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,740
of literature is that there's a lack of

514
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,929
perceived criticality for consumer IOT

515
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,180
now this is changing as real-life

516
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:37,960
attacks start occurring more and more

517
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:40,090
often and legislators are actually very

518
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,550
concerned about this but then there's

519
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,560
this lack of expertise they know it's a

520
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,990
problem but they don't know what to do

521
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,179
about it and actually there are several

522
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,840
governments that have put together tasks

523
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,170
forests task force's to try to figure

524
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,360
out okay how do we solve this problem

525
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:01,690
but it's still in process and so it's

526
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,020
taking some time the next problem is

527
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,970
that in the UK did a study to see okay

528
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,530
if we implement these things what is it

529
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,740
what impact is it going to have what

530
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,930
risks are we going to to suffer and the

531
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:17,830
first thing that they said is it's going

532
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:20,260
to negative negatively impact our small

533
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,220
and micro businesses so our startup

534
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,340
companies who are trying to get out the

535
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:29,270
next best things why security is

536
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:32,840
expensive and it's hard then there's the

537
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:36,740
next thing monitoring costs if I am a

538
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:39,799
government and I put out legislation it

539
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,200
has to be enforced in some way and so

540
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,600
with millions and millions of IOT

541
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,260
devices out there how are they going to

542
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:51,260
reasonably regulate and monitor and

543
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,030
enforce these regulations it's going to

544
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,440
cost a lot of money and so they have to

545
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:59,000
get their heads around that and figure

546
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:02,780
out what to do so we don't have

547
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,490
legislation for for our product

548
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,470
suppliers we don't have legislation for

549
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,659
our asset owners what about standards

550
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,600
let's write some standards and let's

551
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:13,309
give them to the to the IOT product

552
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,980
suppliers and then everything is going

553
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:20,139
to be great well I did a search online

554
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:24,409
to see ok what standards are out there

555
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:26,450
there lots every reputable organization

556
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:29,809
has put together their own set of

557
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,539
standards for IOT security so if I were

558
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,389
an IOT product supplier and I knew

559
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,070
nothing about security if I were to go

560
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,960
online and find all of these things I

561
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,240
would be overwhelmed I wouldn't know

562
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,010
where to start and then I just think I'm

563
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,419
going to wait for legislation and

564
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,080
they'll tell me exactly what I have to

565
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:49,909
do and so standards because there's no

566
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:56,928
de facto standard or no enforced

567
00:25:49,909 --> 00:26:04,070
standard are out for the moments so what

568
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:05,980
do we do IOT product suppliers they're

569
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:10,570
under a lot of pressure to deliver and

570
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:13,340
so it's causing them to cut out security

571
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:16,399
and so what can we do as a security

572
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,689
group as a security community to help

573
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,549
out these IOT people so that we can see

574
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,820
security being built in so that we can

575
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:28,400
be on the Starship Enterprise where you

576
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:33,860
say computer and then things happen and

577
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,990
you know it's secure our first

578
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:39,070
opportunity is with

579
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:41,270
frameworks and the IOT application stack

580
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,700
so earlier in the put in this

581
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,550
presentation I showed you the general

582
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,370
architecture of IOT and the first place

583
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,220
that we can start is in cloud there are

584
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,770
already cloud frameworks out there for

585
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,570
IOT that's going to make building IOT

586
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,600
things much much easier

587
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,700
it has configuration tools it has data

588
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,280
processing tools and it has the ability

589
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,450
for you to actually do over-the-air

590
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:12,280
updates in a safe and secure way the

591
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,050
only challenge is we don't have a

592
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,200
blueprint way of how to do it

593
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:20,149
so if you have some time or if your

594
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,400
company wants to do some research and

595
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:25,460
get your name out there do some research

596
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,309
on how to build a secure implementation

597
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,309
within the cloud for an IOT develop

598
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:33,290
device and publish it developers are not

599
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,330
stupid they want to do the right things

600
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,879
in fact they're SuperDuper smart and

601
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,100
SuperDuper resourceful if you give them

602
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,530
the information on how to do it and how

603
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:47,449
to do it securely they will follow and

604
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:50,149
even more if you if you think about

605
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,550
cloud it's all code now so if you want

606
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,410
to build an infrastructure you write a

607
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,330
script and it builds the infrastructure

608
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,210
for you so rather than giving them

609
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,879
instructions write the code check it

610
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,220
into github and then let them download

611
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,380
it run build their environments and

612
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,220
they'll have something secure to start

613
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,600
with with respect to software

614
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,640
interestingly within the realm of IOT

615
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,559
there's some emerging real-time

616
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,360
operating systems and lightweight

617
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,710
operating systems that are used quite

618
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,260
often you have core OS Ubuntu for IOT

619
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:27,650
Amazon for free our TOS so on and so

620
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,690
forth if you want to help make a

621
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:33,890
reference implementation for an IOT

622
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:36,410
device and then give instructions on how

623
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:40,790
to harden the environment so that people

624
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:45,320
can start with a hardened hardened OS

625
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:47,090
core with respect to the protocols in

626
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,639
the the local area network or the

627
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,379
personal personal area network

628
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,120
you'll see if you start looking at I

629
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,850
ought to devices over and over and over

630
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,219
again the same components are being used

631
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,730
the same components are ble the same

632
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,220
composed for wireless get one of the the

633
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,280
test boards for these and tether creates

634
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,890
once again a mini application and then

635
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,020
test it and then report things that you

636
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,090
find back to the vendors so that they

637
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:18,170
can close the gaps so that we can have

638
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,379
more secure components and in the area

639
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:23,090
of hardware I'm still looking for ideas

640
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,880
every single time I open an IOT device

641
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,530
and look in I see a lot of similar

642
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,860
components but they're often configured

643
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,660
in different ways so really what we the

644
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,290
ideal is if you would have some sort of

645
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,490
reference architecture that IOT P

646
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,889
manufacturers can actually rely upon

647
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,740
that is safe and secure that somebody

648
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:46,870
has vetted and all they have to do is

649
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,870
build their functionality on top of it

650
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,640
there are other opportunities within the

651
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,120
secure development lifecycle one of the

652
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,010
cool things from the cyber ITL study

653
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,510
that we looked at earlier is that they

654
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,520
said there are a large number of

655
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,820
duplicate binaries across multiple

656
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,340
vendors indicating a common build system

657
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:11,270
or tool chain if we knew what these IOT

658
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,689
manufacturers who are using when they

659
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:17,330
were building their third devices we

660
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,919
could help them secure the process but

661
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,100
right now there's no large-scale study

662
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,140
across the different providers to see

663
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,570
what are they using so we can't really

664
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,000
help them so if you are a company that

665
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,178
has access to a lot of IOT providers and

666
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,830
you can get some sort of information to

667
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:38,230
help the broader community so that we

668
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:41,870
can start building the tools to make IOT

669
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:44,480
manufacturing more secure do it get the

670
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,149
information publish it and security will

671
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,650
follow

672
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:53,450
[Music]

673
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:56,210
and then we have our asset owners help

674
00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:00,380
them so as we were talking about Sallie

675
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:02,630
and Jim Sally likes to look on YouTube

676
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,480
to figure out how to solve things if for

677
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:08,360
example her printer went on the fritz

678
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,550
she went into YouTube she found a

679
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,300
tutorial on how to solve the problem

680
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,570
with the printer

681
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,760
she took the printer apart replaced one

682
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,850
of the pieces put it back together again

683
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,450
voila printer works we need something

684
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:24,770
like that for you for security for all

685
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,920
of these devices that are being

686
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:31,370
introduced common devices in the homes

687
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,280
we need some sort of YouTube channel

688
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:36,979
that basically says this is how you set

689
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:40,610
up the device as securely as possible in

690
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:43,880
your home the next idea is to have a

691
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:46,428
consumer security review site this would

692
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,340
be a site that actually rates devices

693
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:51,980
based on security consumers want to know

694
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,689
what's secure and what's not secure

695
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,070
they love these kinds of sites because

696
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,880
they're getting feedback about what

697
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,620
they're about to put into their homes

698
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,710
there is a site already out there called

699
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,989
the Internet of Dex that kind of

700
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,970
does this this name would not fly with

701
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,250
Sally though she wouldn't trust this

702
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:14,030
site what we really need is some sort of

703
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:16,100
consumer site called consumer security

704
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,530
review something very boring but

705
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,240
reputable so that when she goes to the

706
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:23,570
site she can trust the information that

707
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,090
is being presented there and there's

708
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,340
also an opportunity for security tools

709
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,350
for humans there's a really cool tool

710
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,260
out there right now called Princeton IOT

711
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:39,610
inspector and what it does is it

712
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:42,260
monitors your network for for

713
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,928
communication that is strange for IOT

714
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:49,040
devices it also monitors common IOT

715
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:50,570
devices for weak passwords so if we can

716
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,960
build something that's going to help

717
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:56,210
Sally very very easily figure out what's

718
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,720
going on in her network that's a win for

719
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:05,809
us and then last but not least

720
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:08,409
in the situation with a smart home where

721
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:13,370
we had problems with weak passwords

722
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:16,039
reused passwords the default password we

723
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:19,070
need some better way for authentication

724
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,429
for these kinds of devices and services

725
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,830
I don't know what that solution is I

726
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:26,450
have absolutely no clue but we need

727
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,250
something like that so if you're a

728
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,860
security company or a security

729
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,230
individual who has an idea of how to

730
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,168
make this easier for Sally while she

731
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,779
administers her network please introduce

732
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:42,129
it bring it to the the table so that we

733
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:45,620
can get this problem solved

734
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:48,469
now so you're probably sitting in the

735
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,989
audience saying Jen has just told me to

736
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,120
do a whole bunch of stuff and it's not

737
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:56,919
for a customer and I'm not getting paid

738
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:00,250
to do it I have two answers to this one

739
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:03,590
do it as a research and development

740
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,259
opportunity in your company publish the

741
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,929
results and when legislation starts

742
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:10,699
rolling in for IOT devices you're going

743
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,950
to have evidence of your expertise in

744
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,069
the field and people want to hire your

745
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:19,428
company that's the first answer the

746
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:22,730
second answer is the EU has recognized

747
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:26,230
that this is a problem and so they've

748
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:29,060
actually put initiatives into place to

749
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:32,418
funds researchers and small companies

750
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:37,069
that are interested in doing work in IOT

751
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:39,980
security so take a look at the different

752
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:42,079
places or the offers in the you if

753
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:46,730
something matches what you you or your

754
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,919
company does go for it there are lots of

755
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,429
other ideas that I have for potential

756
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:54,770
solutions but ultimately what I want is

757
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,720
to make it a lot easier for our IOT

758
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,270
people who are the small businesses and

759
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,419
then startups to be able to deliver the

760
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:05,329
really cool things so that I can go onto

761
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,060
the Starship Enterprise and explore the

762
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:11,599
universe so that's all that I have for

763
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,009
you today with the one exception I would

764
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,780
like you to get out there

765
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:23,030
and engage thank you

766
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,030
[Applause]
