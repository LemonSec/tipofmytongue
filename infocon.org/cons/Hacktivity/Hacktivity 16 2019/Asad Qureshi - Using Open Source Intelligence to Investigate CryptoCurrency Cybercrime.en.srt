1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,050
the job as an investigator or as an

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:16,698
investigator your job is to find details

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:20,910
associated with the suspicious crime so

4
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:23,869
it's the fact that bitcoin is still the

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,380
most widely used crypto currency today

6
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:32,640
to facilitate cybercrime both on the

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:37,370
dark net and otherwise so we will focus

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,140
on Bitcoin and how we will trace a

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,629
sample transaction we will look at the

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,520
sample case

11
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,930
so as an investigator your job is

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,789
actually to find all the entities

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:55,230
related to that particular crime

14
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:57,539
hostname IP address email address in

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,449
order to find out who is behind the scam

16
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:06,180
or the crime so we also our job isn't

17
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:11,310
also to document all the findings and

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,790
she can help us make the case so we do

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:20,159
not rely on expensive software we should

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:26,900
know how to do this kind of tracing

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:29,090
ourselves as well so we will look at

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,060
[Music]

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:36,960
that hole we we will look at how to

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,140
validate the address and confirm the

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,780
address balance and we will look at

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,950
different tools which we can use to find

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,950
similarities in the crime

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,010
okay so we start by validating the

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,679
address we have a suspicious address on

30
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,810
the Bitcoin blockchain so there is a

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,140
tool which will allow us to check the

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:15,640
address to find out if that particular

33
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,519
address is valid address or not we don't

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,859
know sometimes there is an address which

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,980
would not be a valid Bitcoin address so

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:28,739
the first thing we do is to figure out

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,738
if it is actually a valid address or not

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:42,880
so then we confirm the address balance

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:44,380
we will put rest balance in and see what

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,720
what is actually going on with the

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:03:00,310
transaction so we see that there are

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:03:02,530
multiple addresses so there is another

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,709
tool as well just called betreff and

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,040
this allows us to if you want a user

45
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,500
friendly user-friendly view we can just

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,480
put use this tool which will allow us to

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,390
see we're still trying to confirm the

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,738
transaction so we put in that address

49
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:29,410
and we can see the date and amount which

50
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:31,600
is sent and what the balance is so this

51
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,150
is more of a user friendly tool if you

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,209
don't understand the more complicated

53
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:45,280
blockchain X coders you can use this

54
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:50,350
tool so in this case we see that we have

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,090
a few different dates and see that

56
00:03:50,350 --> 00:04:05,500
amount has there's a - Mountain there is

57
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:08,739
the remaining balance okay so the

58
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,599
Bitcoin address report Bitcoin who is

59
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:18,239
who is another tool that will show us

60
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:23,409
more information about particular crime

61
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:27,849
we see that that is receipt we see the

62
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:30,790
current balance sure yeah we can see

63
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,130
that that this is the address and this

64
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,740
is the name of the wallet this is in

65
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,650
hexadecimal format now we see their

66
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,130
current balance so and here we see the

67
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,799
number of transactions we see the first

68
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:49,450
transaction and we see their last

69
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:56,800
transaction here so we also see that the

70
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:59,710
website appears nine times so the total

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,910
received amount on this address we can

72
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,810
see here and you also see the last

73
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:13,620
transaction IP it's like one two three

74
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:18,930
four heipiess that that are involved in

75
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,930
relating this transaction okay

76
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:32,880
so this is a useful tool yeah yeah by

77
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,739
checking that address we found that

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,889
address appears on multiple websites

79
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:43,720
that have been involved in the scan so

80
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,840
from here we already have a lot more

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,940
information about what is going on

82
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,940
[Music]

83
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,270
okay so have six P Doric using that

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,789
service we can actually link

85
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,039
transactions together and filter out the

86
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,789
most common senders and the related

87
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:10,969
receivers so we see the more four most

88
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:14,840
common senders and four most common

89
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:17,270
receivers and the two most common

90
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:22,669
sending siblings and seven most common

91
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:27,909
receiving siblings so using hash XP we

92
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:35,210
can find out more about their related

93
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:39,279
transactions so the address you're

94
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,279
checking is actually here as you can see

95
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:49,188
okay then you have the famous Bitcoin

96
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:54,770
blockchain Explorer this is the most

97
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:57,110
used program actually tool because they

98
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,909
parent the every transaction on the

99
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,500
Bitcoin blockchain will be recorded on

100
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:06,949
the public option so we can also see the

101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:16,370
transaction here the total received

102
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:20,629
amount and the final balance okay so as

103
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,120
an in as an investigator we need to find

104
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:26,150
out even more information about related

105
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,620
domains so what is actually passive

106
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:40,429
leanness passive dns is a database that

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:45,500
saves all the dns lookups if for example

108
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:48,580
some malware have been using an address

109
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,529
sometimes the attackers change the DNS

110
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,318
which is used only that only on that

111
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:57,639
specific mother campaign then David

112
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,159
after that they will change back again

113
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:04,580
to try to obfuscate the domain which

114
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,520
they used for relaying their

115
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,490
or delivering the Muellers there try to

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,049
temporarily use a specific DNS name then

117
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,540
they will change back for example here

118
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,810
so but when we have this passive DNS

119
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,030
database we can go back and look at

120
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:32,870
which malware was actually using that

121
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:36,179
domain back in time okay

122
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:40,320
mmm only passive DNS service and that is

123
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:44,790
a service which provides us with the

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:50,850
database containing the DNS records of

125
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:54,870
the IP addresses so okay in this

126
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:57,330
particular case we see that that this

127
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,270
this domain was used in the malware

128
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:05,010
campaign so we see that last transaction

129
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:08,040
the date which it was and a record

130
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,850
indicates that when issues websites has

131
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,280
been used for the scan so from that we

132
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:19,170
find if we found out that Eric or points

133
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:24,569
to specific the Adina's Atlas which

134
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:27,120
appears ten times so what is why is this

135
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:31,700
important it's important because we can

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:37,920
relate we can relate the Bitcoin crime

137
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:42,630
to a specific host name so we know that

138
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,849
this smaller has been delivered from

139
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,170
this from this could have been delivered

140
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,630
from this domain we don't know for sure

141
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,630
but our job is to try to find out

142
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:04,000
okay so we checked who is that who is

143
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:09,370
record in this example we are checking

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,600
this address which suffered ten times in

145
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,900
the Pasadena's report and we saw that

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,310
domain is hosted on this IP which also

147
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:26,079
hosts two other sites so if we want we

148
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:32,290
can also contact the abuse department so

149
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:35,770
we know that this domain belongs to this

150
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:39,219
person who is a developer of Bitcoin

151
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:41,110
mining software so this is a resistant

152
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,050
number of questions did the malicious

153
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:48,280
Bitcoin address relations using one of

154
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:51,219
those servers or was this person

155
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,130
involved in the crime or not we don't

156
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,400
know

157
00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:00,960
okay so we will come back to that BGP

158
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:06,340
view is another tool which we can use to

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:17,020
find out who is the ISP of that

160
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:21,640
particular IP address okay so when we

161
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:27,100
are working with forensics we will try

162
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:33,010
to find the related domains so what we

163
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:36,460
do is we take Bitcoin address and use

164
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:43,420
the onion scan tool the onion scan tool

165
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:50,500
will it will actually scan scan the

166
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:57,160
darknet for the darknet address to see

167
00:11:50,500 --> 00:12:02,400
if that bitcoin address is used in in

168
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,400
that in that

169
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:13,859
- mine are not so so onion scan looks

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,329
for more more things like what class to

171
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:20,689
look for the most common cryptocurrency

172
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:24,899
clients and it will also extract the

173
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:27,868
Bitcoin address it will find which email

174
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:33,119
addresses are there and we will look at

175
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:39,419
the images on the darknet site and it

176
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:44,879
will try to find out metadata so many

177
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:49,829
times scammers on darknet they forget to

178
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:53,269
remove the active information in the

179
00:12:49,829 --> 00:13:01,108
image the EXIF information in the image

180
00:12:53,269 --> 00:13:03,179
can contain the GPS location which is a

181
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:05,489
badge is bad for the for the attacker

182
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:09,238
from there you can actually pinpoint

183
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:13,679
from where the exact location that

184
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:15,959
sucker operated that dark net markets or

185
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:21,949
that scam

186
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:25,709
so using that tool we can also look for

187
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:28,469
dark net sites to see if we have a

188
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:32,689
Bitcoin address if it's been involved in

189
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,689
the dark nets on that side

190
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:49,540
okay so search engine investigation so

191
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:56,630
when we we found that domain we had was

192
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:59,449
the developer behind that well he's a

193
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:03,770
Bitcoin developer he calls himself

194
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:07,130
- Jed jay-ar so we tried to find more

195
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:10,699
information about him on social media so

196
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:14,290
just go with him and you'll see more

197
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,290
about know about him

198
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,820
so we also check that on Facebook and

199
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:28,880
LinkedIn we also for more information

200
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:32,450
about mercy but still we do not have

201
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,960
enough evidence to conclude whether he

202
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:40,310
was intentionally involved in that crime

203
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:44,300
or not but our indication points to that

204
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:58,969
one of his domains was used to

205
00:14:44,300 --> 00:15:04,219
facilitate that cybercrime okay so the

206
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:07,160
next tool box we also took the dot IP

207
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,670
which we know which we knew that he was

208
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:15,620
involved in some crime and looked at up

209
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:20,420
on MX toolbox and that gives us some

210
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:23,380
information that that particular IP was

211
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:33,860
already on a blacklist

212
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:41,510
so yeah here we see the blacklist so

213
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:44,120
that means that the the scam or was has

214
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:47,200
been well it can indicate that it has

215
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:54,580
been delivered using

216
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:57,160
a mail server which later on blacklist

217
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:01,170
and someone somebody reported it as a

218
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,170
scanned and it came blacklisted

219
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:17,349
okay spy talks that is another tool and

220
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:20,469
we can actually search for persons it's

221
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:29,260
like a Yellow Pages spy talks will give

222
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:32,230
us information on possible persons who

223
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,149
has a specific email address so that's

224
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:50,170
another tool we can use to aid

225
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:54,700
investigation okay so identifying the

226
00:16:50,170 --> 00:17:01,420
walnut so we can use a tool which is

227
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:05,890
called wallet Explorer it uses a basic

228
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:10,178
algorithm to determine the addresses and

229
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:15,339
it and linked them so if we have an

230
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:22,390
address we can know if it has been spent

231
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:27,240
in another transaction or not it will

232
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:33,429
link possible really link possible

233
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:36,910
transactions together so that means two

234
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:39,669
transactions or addresses actually they

235
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,120
will be they could be part of the same

236
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,120
moment

237
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,630
yeah same example here we have the

238
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:04,469
address we have the date and we have the

239
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:24,300
amount put the sent and received and you

240
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:25,710
can check each transaction okay yeah it

241
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,550
is possible that the suspect is using

242
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,800
multiple wallets as well often there are

243
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:36,330
multiple addresses which are generated

244
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,060
from one single wallet because most

245
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:42,300
crypto exchanges can generate a new

246
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:49,440
unique address which will link to the

247
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:52,379
same wallet so even if the attacker is

248
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,390
using a new unique address it belongs to

249
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:59,540
the same so politics Pro Explorer who

250
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,770
the guy who made wallet Explorer

251
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:12,060
actually now works for this company

252
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:19,860
called chain analysis ok

253
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:22,200
the oxt not me that is another tool we

254
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,379
can use to look up the Bitcoin address

255
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,970
and the benefit of using this tool is

256
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,840
that it will actually give us a graph

257
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:40,260
graph which will show us the incoming

258
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:45,260
and outgoing transactions so yeah

259
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,260
something here is a possible wallet name

260
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,330
the information is basically the same

261
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,539
which we will find in the blockchain

262
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:57,510
score but

263
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:00,960
here we can have a visual visualization

264
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,230
of it so it could be useful even if we

265
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:11,520
want to use that in my report test

266
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:15,090
report we can visualize the crime so it

267
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,210
also gives us the dates so we can see

268
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:26,580
when that activity was higher and it was

269
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:30,150
lower okay and we also have alt coins

270
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,210
which are actually other coins or

271
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:37,590
cryptocurrencies

272
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:42,299
one of them is gigabyte did you bite it

273
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:48,439
is used as an example only so what we do

274
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:52,799
is we search for the address on

275
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:59,360
digibytes blockchain Explorer which

276
00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:04,770
gives us that this address belongs to

277
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:08,280
the Beatrix exchange and the Beatrix

278
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:15,650
exchange contains this amount of

279
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:19,260
gigabyte so and we also have the

280
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:21,770
addresses which correspond to that

281
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,770
moment

282
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:32,409
yeah so sometimes a larger walnut in

283
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:36,909
Spanish change and that and from there

284
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:40,450
we can know that if the attacker is

285
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,760
sending altcoin or some coin to an

286
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,840
exchange we can go directly to the

287
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,870
exchange and get the information about

288
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,990
the user from the exchange because most

289
00:21:49,870 --> 00:22:04,719
exchanges will ask for identification

290
00:21:52,990 --> 00:22:12,070
documents yeah so decentralized

291
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:14,550
exchanges most so-called decentralized

292
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:18,100
exchanges are not actually decentralized

293
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:20,200
they are actually hybrid exchanges which

294
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:25,750
means that they have a coin gateway

295
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:28,720
which connects to another blockchain so

296
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:32,350
the coin gateway which means that if

297
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,260
you're sending Bitcoin to this

298
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,870
centralized exchange it is actually not

299
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,320
decentralized it is using a coin gateway

300
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:46,389
to send that Bitcoin on the Bitcoin

301
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:48,580
network so the coin gateway will have

302
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,190
some sort of chain analysis software

303
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,810
easily and that will check the

304
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:58,300
transaction if that address is listed in

305
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:04,450
some scam if it's a blacklist address or

306
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:06,460
not so so they're based on the new rules

307
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:10,000
that will apply to crypto currency

308
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:15,360
exchanges it's our recommendation for

309
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,910
the g7 countries all exchanges have to

310
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,540
not only carry each users information

311
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:26,350
when a transaction is moving from one

312
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:32,360
exchange to another but they also have

313
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:35,178
to store they also have to store that

314
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,350
section four I don't know the exact

315
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:42,440
amount of time back but they have to

316
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:50,059
store it for some time so they can go

317
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:55,270
back and see who has sent the money yeah

318
00:23:50,059 --> 00:24:10,389
the KYC is now being rolled out to

319
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:15,559
decentralized exchanges as well okay so

320
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:17,929
what are p2p exchanges p2p exchanges are

321
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:21,440
actually peer to peer exchanges they're

322
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:23,840
not well I can say that they are more

323
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,320
decentralized you can say that they are

324
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,320
truly decentralized because no third

325
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:37,159
party is involved so for example we have

326
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:39,200
disk using disk we can send the you can

327
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,130
you can actually buy and sell Bitcoin

328
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,250
directly over the Tor network but even

329
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:51,410
if you are using bisque it is still

330
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:59,120
possible to figure out some information

331
00:24:51,410 --> 00:25:01,820
about the transaction so that is

332
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,270
possible because there are certain

333
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:09,100
patterns you can refer in the traffic if

334
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:13,820
we were to intercept the tour conduct or

335
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:16,250
traffic or communication and we can look

336
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,918
for certain pattern patterns and find

337
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:25,030
out more about that particular

338
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,030
transaction some of them are listed here

339
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:40,710
yeah

340
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:43,560
so yes there's an example if you can

341
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:49,620
write small tools to detect traffic

342
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:53,690
inside bisque Network but we still will

343
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:58,379
need to set up a fake tor node or

344
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:02,730
intercepted traffic in order to be able

345
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:05,700
to detect that and that Bitcoin

346
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,840
transaction is coming from

347
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:18,000
abyss cloud yeah

348
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:24,209
so let's go further yeah okay so there

349
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,630
is a challenge with tracing the Bitcoin

350
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,660
blockchain so the first thing is that

351
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:34,980
privacy coins for example Manero

352
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:37,980
they're sending they're sending they are

353
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:42,420
actually obfuscating the amount which is

354
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:45,870
sent so we don't know it's very hard to

355
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:48,030
trace vulnerable transactions but still

356
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:54,889
malaria is not widely used on the

357
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:58,740
darknet it's still Bitcoin and conjoin

358
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:02,820
so co enjoyin is a technique which is

359
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:05,520
used by Bitcoin what is not part of

360
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,909
Bitcoin but using Oh enjoying our wallet

361
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,510
you can actually muster it the traffic

362
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:19,350
you can mix the traffic so you are not

363
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:22,770
able to determine where the which path

364
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:27,149
the traffic has taken so coin join is

365
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:29,480
used to bypass software like chain

366
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,480
analysis

367
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:40,010
so here we have an example of a

368
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:43,729
transaction which is without conjoin and

369
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:48,750
here we have an example of a transaction

370
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:52,310
Bitcoin Juran kwangin basically mixes

371
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:54,510
the transaction so it breaks the links

372
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:57,510
it breaks the link in the Bitcoin

373
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:02,180
blockchain so you cannot know exactly

374
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:04,800
which part a transaction has taken so

375
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,800
but there is another thing with Cohen

376
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,530
join if it's not implemented properly we

377
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,399
have had some wallets like wasabi wallet

378
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:18,420
which used the UT EXO the unspent

379
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,640
transaction output then the

380
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:24,090
implementation of coins oh and is not

381
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:31,260
that good so we can still detect that

382
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:34,260
transaction because some of the actually

383
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:38,910
the mix is not done properly that's the

384
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:41,610
reason so would a samurai wallet is

385
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:47,790
actually the one that implements

386
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:52,080
conjoined in a way that makes tracing

387
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:56,550
the origin of the transaction very hard

388
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,139
on the Bitcoin network so and there's

389
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,240
another thing with the private fool node

390
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:06,540
if you run your own Bitcoin private firm

391
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:08,940
node you also achieve privacy so for

392
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,040
example if you are using disk with your

393
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:17,220
own profitable node that also helps to

394
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:21,300
from a privacy perspective to make it

395
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,010
harder to detect the transaction and we

396
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:27,389
have the Lightning Network which is

397
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:33,900
coming lightning Network is a second

398
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:37,950
layer protocol it will maybe add some

399
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:40,770
privacy futures in Bitcoin but we don't

400
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,830
know when so but most probably it will

401
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,980
be optional privacy features in Bitcoin

402
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,980
that are that is coming in future

403
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:52,370
so we don't know when so that would also

404
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:57,769
make it harder for us to I'm trying to

405
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:59,870
trace the origin of a transaction yeah

406
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:03,260
so the users who don't around their own

407
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:06,110
footnote are also exposed to privacy

408
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,600
leak this is from the basic

409
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:14,418
documentation and that there was

410
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:17,059
actually a bug there so so our full

411
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,830
spying node will find out easily that

412
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,740
all the addresses created by their

413
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:25,549
wallet are from one wallet and belongs

414
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:31,659
to the same owner so we can actually set

415
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:38,240
up a fake full node on the Tor network

416
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:41,260
to spy on the bits of traffic so I don't

417
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:45,380
know if it's done already or not but

418
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:49,039
there is vulnerability as you can see so

419
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,919
even when using risk or other

420
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:56,750
decentralized exchanges it still leaves

421
00:30:51,919 --> 00:31:07,610
traces on the blockchain so you can

422
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:10,010
still find out information okay so by

423
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:13,908
combining the chain analysis with

424
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:18,470
passive dns and alternative coin wallet

425
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:20,779
explorers and darknet we can get a

426
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:26,870
forensic evidence and relate different

427
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:32,559
crimes so I've shown an example of a

428
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:36,830
case earlier where I used this technique

429
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:39,549
but we need usually we need much more

430
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:42,110
information than that to actually

431
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:44,960
determine if someone is actually behind

432
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:48,260
that crime or not but it will lead us a

433
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:53,120
long way by combining the information

434
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:55,809
using open source tools yeah that's what

435
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,809
I had actually

436
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,440
so I found any questions I can yeah open

437
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,439
for them
