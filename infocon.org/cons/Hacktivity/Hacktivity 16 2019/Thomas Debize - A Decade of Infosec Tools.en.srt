1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
hello everyone I'm Tomas Tamera B's I'm

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,269
really glad to be here too my first time

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,670
in Hungarian activity so today we will

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,120
talk about little study of perform about

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,390
info sectors but first here's my geetam

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,230
maybe if you already seen one of my tool

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,240
just say hello but we'll see after so

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:28,619
here's the agenda I won't be too long

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,140
and I will show you a lot of stuff so to

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,390
be frank in the last decade I think you

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,579
managed to see it also there there's

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,379
been lots of new tools crafted and why

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,910
the first question is why because I

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,949
think from my point of view some horse

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,989
with dreams now come true just as you

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,719
can now scan the entire ipv4 space

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,149
within just before with an ID biani pot

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,270
you can scan all the around the world

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,860
and find a lots of multiple stuff you

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,039
can query all open source information

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,699
you want through a platform like scans

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,420
dot IO showed an and a lot of open

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,729
source massive databases you can know in

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,530
the cooperate Windows word you can pound

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:17,070
and a lot of cooperation first structure

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,549
even lunch one with to like blow down

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,139
and mimic ads and you can fighting is

28
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,570
the trend is the current trend so you

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,189
can first everything you want right now

30
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,619
you can you can stow a lot of password

31
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:32,758
and hashes try to crack them every time

32
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,229
the second reason I think is Hawaii with

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,540
you a lot of - right now because coding

34
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,170
became kind of Scioscia this is like it

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,049
was I think it's still the github dragon

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,659
social coding but to be frank I've seen

37
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,659
a lot of InfoSec people getting their

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,649
coding skills enhanced they want to

39
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,610
write some good and practical tool with

40
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,340
preference Lee with new version are

41
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,979
beaches and some exhibition already

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,869
devoted to the tool crafting art such as

43
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,320
the blackout Arsenal only devoted to

44
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,880
tools and to be frank as a conclusion

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,429
more and more people are writing more

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,400
and more good quality stuff and the

47
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:15,269
third one I think there's

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,810
Motul Halloween attack and defense why I

49
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:21,269
think we are gaining a lot of popularity

50
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,579
for the blue side we've moved we are

51
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,140
moving from the breaking era to the

52
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:30,239
securing and building in wrath through

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:34,170
bug bounties which honor some who knows

54
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,980
the blue side with the massive source of

55
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,540
information coming from the crowd and

56
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,220
then at a certain point I think we are

57
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,679
finally taking advantage of the

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,109
visualizations such as blue down

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,569
representing stuff in graph and it helps

60
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:53,489
you know defenders and attackers but in

61
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,290
the same time so a lot of tool have been

62
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,859
developed and good quality stuff but we

63
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,920
still rely on some horse cool tools such

64
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:09,510
as this one I think you can see it it's

65
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:12,358
dates from 1997 which is an map and it's

66
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,260
still the most pertinent for eminent to

67
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:18,810
tool to perform some port scanning THC

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,209
which produced a lot of fuel which like

69
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,970
Hydra you know you've seen the date it's

70
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,799
not coming from last year and the group

71
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,930
was formed in the middle of the 90s and

72
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,120
their truth is still quite use I think

73
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,440
even even folk from beginners to

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,440
professional in 2003 feel down the guy

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,728
behind a map perform like a benchmark or

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,819
a survey and in so almost twenty years

77
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,229
ago you can see what which was which

78
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,260
where they were told and the renowned

79
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,180
Toulon you can recognize that the most

80
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,409
most of the tool listed here are still

81
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,419
active and maintained nikto enmities can

82
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:59,909
iron only I won't say maintained but

83
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,970
still exist in IAM working cane in a

84
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,959
hovel OpenSSL which is the horse cool

85
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,430
stuff

86
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,799
THC Hydra actively maintained so in the

87
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,810
same time we developed a lot of neutral

88
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,978
but we are still using some good old

89
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:20,070
tools and to be frank I was asking I was

90
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,710
wondering when I facing this this

91
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,779
conclusion I was asking how are these

92
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,320
new tools really built and are they

93
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,240
really

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,110
than the previous one where they're

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,870
hosted if there are trends can we can we

96
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,780
say that every tool is posted some in

97
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,430
some places specific places how long are

98
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,549
the maintained you have seen some n

99
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,070
happens hold tools they are most of them

100
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,660
are still maintained and they're really

101
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,610
better design than the whole one

102
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,540
remember than the first version of

103
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,600
netcat was vulnerable to stack buffer

104
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,490
overflow so which is a shame for

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,000
security security practitioner using a

106
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:04,050
secret even Harbor stuff and all you

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,740
know how would it how did it evolve what

108
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,780
are the trends and how our community

109
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,890
have been doing with this kind of tool

110
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,520
so what I've been doing is analyzed the

111
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:21,240
metadata from full source of publication

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,099
for renown and major sources the first

113
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,400
one I think you know it it's packets Dom

114
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,890
which is a cool old-school platform the

115
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,370
second one to watch third one kid

116
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,039
Floyd's

117
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:37,500
and the last one know where this is the

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:40,860
source of my study from the to the the

119
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,320
first the two first sources I've been

120
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,500
crawling manually the results in the

121
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,909
achieve and you'll see just after for

122
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,740
the two last one I've been taking the

123
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,530
very nose that come feed which provides

124
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,480
structure data for free which is very

125
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:59,280
helpful and how did I did it with that I

126
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,550
take oh I don't know if you know it's a

127
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,929
French based startup doing an amazing

128
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,910
tool mostly I use it as a excel excel

129
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,860
better better than Excel tool mostly

130
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,460
excellent stories we can try it for free

131
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,720
there's a free fredison I will not Rama

132
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,789
stretching the two but I've been doing

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,340
all the study with this tool because of

134
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,680
the convenience and how many record have

135
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,090
been alized so four packets Tom you see

136
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,090
almost seven seven thousand tools watch

137
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:34,010
one thousand and a half deployed three

138
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,010
thousand and nowhere one thousand

139
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,799
just was as I was saying if you don't

140
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,210
know where that come just try just check

141
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,699
their website I don't know if some of

142
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,680
you know that come stuffy is here but I

143
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,569
want to say hello to these people

144
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,280
because they are providing for free

145
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,259
really good quality and they're

146
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,440
structuring data of instruct

147
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:56,139
unstructured feed blog

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,259
IOC exploit whatever so just check out

149
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,849
their website and I was using for my

150
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:06,639
study I was downloading the correction

151
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:08,620
the whole the whole dataset from from

152
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,789
what was it what are they calling our

153
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:16,750
chip so first the source of the data set

154
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:25,270
so I'm switching okay

155
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:29,470
wait for it so know what I've been doing

156
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:32,258
is I'm after collecting rubbing all the

157
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,630
data I was saying that packets Dom the

158
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:38,650
first post and the first tool post in

159
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,419
packets Tom started from 1994 which is

160
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,940
not relevant because all the other

161
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,280
sources are not where not existing at

162
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,770
the time so I was featuring so from the

163
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,750
last decade and you can see that the

164
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,460
most of the most of the sources have the

165
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,150
same order of magnitude you know it's

166
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:01,180
counts in thousands few thousands of

167
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:04,570
data so the first thing the first graph

168
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,030
I wanted to draw is this one so you can

169
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,789
see don't don't take a look at the end

170
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,349
of the graph you know it's it's it feels

171
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:15,070
like it goes down but it's just because

172
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:17,289
it's the four quarter of this year and

173
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,300
it's just started so it's normal that

174
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,340
the numbers are really lower than the

175
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,289
previous so you just have to just to

176
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,609
stop here and you can see that on the

177
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:31,300
whole if you draw a line it goes on and

178
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,039
it goes up from 2010 so the first

179
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,360
conclusion is more and more tools are

180
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:42,309
being published and if you see it by

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,169
saucers it will print so you can find

182
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,660
here the four major sources keep Lloyd

183
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,029
packets Tom tools watch and nowhere so

184
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,480
the first thing we see is Keith Floyd is

185
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:55,360
really buying everything and publishing

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,660
a lot of love a lot of Tours and is

187
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,449
trying to be the new references for

188
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,130
force for tool publication and here you

189
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,500
can see that by a packet Psalm it's

190
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,759
quite maintaining his rhythm which is

191
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,529
quite good

192
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,060
on the contrary then tourists watch the

193
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,910
talk which is I don't know I don't know

194
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,979
why I don't know the reason but

195
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:19,630
publication out decreasing a lot in to

196
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:23,230
be zero and nowhere the same there was

197
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,329
there was a peak few years ago but now I

198
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,649
don't know it starts to decrease a bit I

199
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:30,579
don't know the context I don't know the

200
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:33,480
reason but still so you can see kid

201
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:37,888
ployed is trying to build a new source

202
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,630
the other question I was asking sorry

203
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:45,069
you know there was a question I was

204
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,500
asking was where the tool really hosted

205
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:50,769
for Indian even if you get published on

206
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,089
one or one of the four major sources in

207
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:58,329
the end the tool is supposedly hosted on

208
00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:01,240
Gita you can see the hegemony as we say

209
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,339
in France the magnificence of github

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,470
compared to all other sources

211
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:10,120
I was pretty to be frank I was pretty

212
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,660
surprised that to see that bitbucket is

213
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,410
ready go way down you know the good old

214
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:21,339
wood sauce for cut girl.com which is now

215
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,810
shut down but bitbucket is you can have

216
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,209
the impression that bitbucket is already

217
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,099
developed for security people but we

218
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,839
don't like apparently to host our tool

219
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,819
on bitbucket

220
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,069
which is not a good quite a good idea I

221
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:37,000
think we should build some residency

222
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:40,630
because tomorrow is github closes or has

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,660
a new policy what our stuff is gonna be

224
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:51,160
locked there then another interesting

225
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:53,829
RAF is so we can see from the previous

226
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,319
graph than get-ups was for google.com

227
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:59,989
and baquette kind of where

228
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,779
at least in our mind the four sources

229
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,430
for to law sting and you can see read

230
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:11,959
that before cute this is this one before

231
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:15,349
q2 or q3 of 2013 you know they're well

232
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:17,329
not like needed emo needs somewhere

233
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,120
because other competition was trying to

234
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:23,329
fight and try to share the market but at

235
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,209
some Tony turning points in 2013

236
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:29,180
ready github won everything you can see

237
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:30,768
the the graph now everything is indeed

238
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:36,859
up in our community that's a conclusion

239
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:42,560
of this graph apparently yeah so if

240
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:45,079
everything if I go back to my slides if

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,849
everything is on github let's focus on

242
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:56,870
github so what I did is taking the

243
00:11:49,850 --> 00:12:00,290
analyzing to 2300 of github repositories

244
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,240
for info sectors and just having trying

245
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,569
to great to get some statistics for each

246
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,750
one and computing the average the median

247
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:11,360
and the standard deviation as just a

248
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,449
scientific study so stars here you can

249
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,540
see that on the average an info sexual

250
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:21,139
get one one thousand stars and the

251
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,480
median is 200 so remember the median

252
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,130
divide the words into the upper part and

253
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,529
the lower part so here's a lower part so

254
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,160
if you develop some tours and you gather

255
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,949
a number of stars above this number

256
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,649
almost as I'm sorry almost three on the

257
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:39,139
red so you're in the top part and if you

258
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:43,490
are below well you can gain some

259
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:46,160
popularity it will help then for Fox you

260
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,130
can see the number so there are more

261
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,230
stars on Fox people are more inclined to

262
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,760
to like it will then maybe trying to

263
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,060
contribute this is maybe the first

264
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,040
impression the Watchers is kind of the

265
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,459
same number of the stars why because one

266
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,519
star in this is one watch on github

267
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:06,560
release is a interesting number we don't

268
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,350
we don't release on much we don't

269
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,790
release motivation in at least in the

270
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,480
get up format you know

271
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,880
creating a real and a true release we

272
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,490
are publishing review on the average you

273
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,080
see few releases if you don't publish

274
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:28,250
anything yeah on the on the median line

275
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,020
if I think you cannot go down maybe if

276
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,580
you publish one release which is broken

277
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,110
maybe you're even worse than the median

278
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,960
maybe but at least

279
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:40,220
yeah we don't provision much the size on

280
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:45,170
the average our tool weigh 15 Meg's

281
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:47,330
on the median is one mix the commit

282
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,430
number of commits you can see it it

283
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,160
doesn't say anything I don't have any

284
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,260
expansion for this but the next one the

285
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,110
next indicator is really interesting and

286
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,330
what what was one of the the key points

287
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,130
I wanted to investigate on I was really

288
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,470
asking in our community we're publishing

289
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,230
a lot of stuff how long do we maintain

290
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,060
our tools ready because having a good

291
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,000
tools working on day one is group is

292
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,189
cool but same tool working ten years

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,080
after of five years affair is really

294
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,420
better so you can see that on the

295
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,220
average we maintain our tools during two

296
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:25,130
years and a half which is two to my

297
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,930
opinion pretty pretty good because we

298
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,780
publish a lot of scripts you know quick

299
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,140
and dirty stuff and this numbers show

300
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,650
that at least on the average well

301
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,850
mentioning train wanting to maintain

302
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,480
longer this kind of quick and dirty

303
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:46,130
stuff because maybe some people trying

304
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,440
to be trying to take this trip and try

305
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:54,470
to make them better and main officially

306
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:57,140
maintain them all the issues now you can

307
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,140
see this kind of numbers so a lot of

308
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:04,370
issues what really interesting that is

309
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,920
the ratio of whole issues rated to the

310
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,320
open one so I think you can see on

311
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,270
average we have this number in on open

312
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,910
we have this one so we are I think

313
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,430
pretty good on fixing stuff or at least

314
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,230
trying to closing tickets and issues

315
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,469
maybe not for a good reason but at least

316
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,270
we were trying to to get involved into

317
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,450
the maintenance maintenance

318
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,010
on the pull request is also I think a

319
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:31,750
good number with this kind of number are

320
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:35,959
continually evolving in increasing so

321
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:40,339
you have like 70 under average 70 pull

322
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,890
requests contribution total and we also

323
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,870
validate a lot of pull requests because

324
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,839
you can see that the number of open pull

325
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:52,839
requests is pretty low compared to the

326
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:57,500
pull request number so let's go back to

327
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,120
the graph so as I was saying so from the

328
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,000
first pile of stuff the study everything

329
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:07,220
that everything is kind of a steady on

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,740
github so let's focus on github and

331
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:15,830
right now I wanted to know what are the

332
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,560
the most stared info sector so you'd you

333
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:22,779
can see everything here but from the

334
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,010
study from the whole the 23,000

335
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,920
repositories in eyes you can see the

336
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,170
most popular one so here I don't really

337
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,550
know the what you stood is really

338
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,709
doing I I don't know it I don't use it

339
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,529
but I think it's for good see the number

340
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,479
is really the true one the true first

341
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,310
after we have a sec list from the onion

342
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,829
missile that shows something interesting

343
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,930
to me that we can have the best tool in

344
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,719
the world in the end we want with

345
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,630
preferably wants a good list a good war

346
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,250
list so this this repository hosts on

347
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:57,230
good words for every sing bass words

348
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:59,089
your user name whatever and that there's

349
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,459
something about the community building

350
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,110
to this quite ship maintaining and

351
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:05,059
having a good word list is the key is

352
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,750
the key to perform a good penetration

353
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:10,280
tester or to protect yourself

354
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,849
jacocks which is a reverse engineering

355
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,709
stuff you can see here Metasploit so

356
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,319
with this project is in the top one two

357
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,300
three four five top five most tears

358
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:26,599
almost appreciated through landeta

359
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:28,669
apparently Deidra which which did a good

360
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,760
breakthrough in this ranking because

361
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,510
it's

362
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,550
previously publicly a new tool and from

363
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,170
the beginning it just got accepted by

364
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:43,740
our community and the numbers are pretty

365
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:46,540
high pretty fast can reconsider SQL map

366
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,060
the NS pilot speaker this morning told

367
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,870
about this DNS pie so you can see it is

368
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:56,500
in the top 20 most preferred favorite

369
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,149
tools in our community the thing is from

370
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,830
this graph if I draw conclusion I think

371
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:04,810
mostly of France if stuff apart from the

372
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,360
apart from the from from few one which

373
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,919
can be used from attacking defense but

374
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,990
most of the tool you can see me to

375
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,360
sploit DNS PI for reverse engineering

376
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:17,320
cyclist for brute forcing stuff

377
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,419
deidre ml TM proxy this is more

378
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,669
offensive stuff which was I think I

379
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,140
don't know you cannot like you have you

380
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,350
have the right not to agree with me but

381
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:31,000
I think mostly offensive stuff then if

382
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,530
we move on to the most repository

383
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,740
you can see here the first one is

384
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,480
Metasploit so it's validates the

385
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,100
popularity in the attractiveness of

386
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Metasploit for people trying to

387
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,409
contribute then you can see you can see

388
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,560
that off tool we've seen just before

389
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:54,030
jeddaks Deidre Emmett am proxy empowered

390
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:59,050
in the top twenty two repositories

391
00:18:54,030 --> 00:19:01,389
mimikatz which again see I still see in

392
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,940
the most folk most mostly offensive

393
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,610
stores I don't know I don't know I don't

394
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,500
know why I cannot explain I think people

395
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,530
want to when this year good tour they

396
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,900
want to fork it making some slight

397
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:16,000
modification for their own usage and use

398
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,490
it for mostly offensive purposes and

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,960
maybe at the end trying to contribute

400
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,100
back and to pot back there a

401
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,560
modification to the to the official tour

402
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,060
then for the biggest number of you

403
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,790
cannot see but this is the biggest

404
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:35,950
number of open issues here I see mostly

405
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,780
maybe defensive stuff you can see miss

406
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,020
which arrived in the second position you

407
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,509
I think you who in this room knows raise

408
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,929
your hand about Miss

409
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:48,299
Oh phew your hands I would expect more

410
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:53,549
miss be the project from the Luxembourg

411
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:58,739
set and he helps certs and Bruce blue

412
00:19:53,549 --> 00:20:01,830
teamers by being a summarization of fire

413
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:06,090
season and defensive stuff for everyday

414
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:10,259
purposes I please ashes from malware and

415
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:11,970
so you can see rather headers or so with

416
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,850
the biggest number of open issues so

417
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:18,749
people want to contribute Rio and to

418
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:25,168
trying to fix or to just to open some to

419
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:28,019
our sake I would I say just to yet to to

420
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:30,779
show some bugs in this world and want by

421
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,929
Indian maybe wanting to to infer to

422
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:38,279
improve it and you can see kuku some

423
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:40,700
dogs still Metasploit and map which is

424
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:46,820
real attack n different stuff

425
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:50,039
then let's move on with the next graph

426
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:54,450
which is the InfoSec tube with the

427
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,429
biggest number of open pull requests so

428
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,769
after opening your issue maybe at the

429
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,179
same time you want to open to contribute

430
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:05,960
by submitting a poor request

431
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:09,690
so here the I think we we see mostly

432
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,359
mostly defensive stuff with nmap I think

433
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:16,710
people want to increase their nmap just

434
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:18,899
to be allowed to be yeah not to be a lot

435
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,539
but to to be able sorry to be able to

436
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:23,668
detect no stuff you can see anger which

437
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,799
is not pretty a difference if stuff

438
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:29,489
maybe if mostly for reverse engineering

439
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:32,999
but yeah this is the I think this is an

440
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:35,429
interesting graph to see that the

441
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:40,590
project was the most contribution open

442
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:43,950
contribution and then when interest ring

443
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,779
graph also is the top 20 of the info

444
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,630
sexual with the longest maintenance

445
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:53,740
period so here you can see seven

446
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:55,570
thousand days it's in it's in days the

447
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,110
graph get up

448
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,419
so seven seven thousand days it's more

449
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,270
like it's close to twenty years ago 20

450
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,130
years ago get up wasn't invented so I to

451
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:10,540
be frank I was expecting six is roughly

452
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:12,390
the number already cheap you know my my

453
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,680
whole my whole study is up

454
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:17,560
nothing is really good here and I've

455
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,350
been to several repositories and no I

456
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,810
discovered that on github you can have

457
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,820
back back dates so some cricketer which

458
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,669
is the first one with the being the most

459
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,520
the most maintain yeah you can you can

460
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,660
see here the first I don't know if it's

461
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,790
big enough for you but it dates from

462
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,490
1999 for the first commits on this

463
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,780
implicit O'Toole after being published

464
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,240
on github dates ready like 20 years ago

465
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:49,030
you can see in also in the changelog it

466
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,510
really starts from from from this period

467
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:57,280
so good news in my study is not that

468
00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:00,129
factored so this graph here you can see

469
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,580
you can you can find after sampling

470
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,880
quatre TCP replay which is also a good

471
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:10,139
good old tool ettercap in packet which

472
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,730
is which start to be a whole project

473
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,400
actively maintained but still a good

474
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,890
good framework for Windows Windows

475
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,800
communication and map you can see your

476
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:25,060
Widow land map here a crack or so

477
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,350
Trinity I don't think it's them I don't

478
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,889
know if it is hunter in Norway with

479
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,399
Justin before so yeah it was interesting

480
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,590
to see because to be frank

481
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,750
apart from an map attack happen and in

482
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,540
packet I wouldn't know a lot of tool

483
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,010
here so in apple-pie net Spock PSEG I

484
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,050
don't know this tool maybe you do but I

485
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,480
don't know and to be frank they have

486
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:52,960
been actively maintained in our

487
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:56,320
community then what I wanted to see are

488
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,420
interesting the languages so

489
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,129
we've seen so far that everything is

490
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,360
hosted on github there's more and more

491
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:07,810
tools we have I think maybe good numbers

492
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,179
of maintenance and contribution in our

493
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:13,060
community so the next thing I wanted to

494
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:17,560
see is the language the most preferred

495
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,419
language we use and so from the github

496
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,730
repositories in scanning the languages

497
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:25,030
there's an API to determine for project

498
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:28,630
the proportion of Python or whatever

499
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:32,200
language code you have in this project

500
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:34,150
so teram the first language our most

501
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,670
preferred languages python I don't know

502
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,140
if it's surprising to you I don't it's

503
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,580
not a surprise to me because first I

504
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,920
like peat Python and I see a lot of

505
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,689
total written in Python because in

506
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,730
Python you have can do everything

507
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,980
there's a lot of library you can really

508
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:52,800
perform everything and reuse instead of

509
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:55,300
develop then you can see shell HTML so

510
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,940
in the top five we have C and JavaScript

511
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,040
and what's interesting because I have

512
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,130
been doing this study I've been praying

513
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:06,879
the study twice this year and I've seen

514
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:10,390
a nice trend in the in the figure so in

515
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:15,730
the early early year version of this

516
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:17,620
study C shop was behind Objective C so

517
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,460
you can see that C shop is drained is

518
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,229
gaining popularity

519
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:26,560
then go was behind Perl so we can see

520
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,530
that go is trying to again advance in

521
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,270
our community and the last one which is

522
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,180
interesting

523
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:36,250
get up classifies it as a language

524
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:39,700
docker file so and the cough I was

525
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:43,500
behind CSS so by with this movement we

526
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,210
can see that docker c-sharp and go is

527
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,330
gaining popularity and being more and

528
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:52,540
more used but still Python in shell is

529
00:25:49,330 --> 00:26:00,070
are the most predominant languages that

530
00:25:52,540 --> 00:26:01,720
we use so whatever so if a lot of to

531
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,120
laughs are mostly developed in Python

532
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,940
let's focus on Python and then

533
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,780
on the next part of the study I've been

534
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:15,050
taking all the Python tools published on

535
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,220
github and trying to see some trends are

536
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,820
trained trying to see the

537
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:25,700
characteristics of this of this movement

538
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:28,310
so here I don't know this is a dump

539
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,550
I don't know why I've been doing this

540
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,260
but I wanted to see the top 20 of the

541
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,510
info sectors in Python having the

542
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,840
biggest number the biggest number of

543
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:41,330
dependencies so maybe the most complex

544
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,970
stuff we have so far so you can

545
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:47,889
recognize some leaking cut which is if I

546
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:51,350
don't mistake an Andre the Andre the

547
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:59,210
framework or general purpose stuff to

548
00:26:51,350 --> 00:27:01,790
act on Android application so plazo you

549
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,980
can recognize plays over here silent

550
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:06,530
Trinity which is quite a tiny project so

551
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:11,330
far but still with a lot of dependencies

552
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:14,510
you can see almost 50 so when it was the

553
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:17,689
first graph I wanted to to show and then

554
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,110
most interesting ref the top 20 of the

555
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:23,000
most used Python third-party modules

556
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:26,360
that we use and here you recognize that

557
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,700
the most popular library we use in our

558
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Python program requests so to perform

559
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:36,590
HTTP requests beautifulsoup and Alex ml

560
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,459
to to to pass HTML XML and so on

561
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:43,820
6 just to this is des turns out also 6

562
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:47,510
is the utility to to convert your Python

563
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:50,090
to script into Python 3 so we are seeing

564
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:53,240
that a lot of people are you are trying

565
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:55,189
to port the script from 2 to 3 then we

566
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,150
have Kohana because I curse wonder fancy

567
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,220
shell with some colorful stuff DNS

568
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,630
Pathan flask

569
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,210
Charlotte Charlotte is a good news to

570
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,750
see Charlotte in the top maybe to a 10

571
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:10,880
or 20 15 most popular sorry most popular

572
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,600
library because Charlotte is made for

573
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,640
shattered detection and trying to Train

574
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,889
to n giving your script the ability to

575
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
to be used worldwide

576
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,350
in every languages so you use please use

577
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,510
charted for your program then you have

578
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,090
term column which is like the Nemesis of

579
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,129
Kalama so Kalani is way more popular

580
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:34,070
than term color for your for coloring

581
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,940
your shadow and what's very interesting

582
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:40,580
in the in the in this list is you can

583
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,890
see that so far is really general

584
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,879
proposed library to perform some HTTP

585
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,169
request it's not it's not I think

586
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,529
specific to our community in foster

587
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:55,010
community but the first specific library

588
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:57,880
to use the people using their project is

589
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,919
Scapa this is the first

590
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,000
security-oriented library that we

591
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,809
apparently use because it's the first

592
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:12,409
one in the top 20 not being general

593
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:17,269
general for general purpose then digging

594
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:21,649
deep digging deep into the into the

595
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:24,649
study I wanted to see that which crypto

596
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:27,620
module in Python that we like to use and

597
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:30,439
I wasn't surprised by the result but

598
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,268
Freddy I think you if you're developing

599
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,340
your Python trip and wanted to perform

600
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:35,809
some crypto stuff you Rea need to be

601
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,720
careful because a lot of people are

602
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:43,309
using PI crypto apparently PI crypto is

603
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,620
not maintained anymore since to 2013 and

604
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:49,399
there's some some very nervous that

605
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,340
affect this library so please stop using

606
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:54,199
PI crypto prefer if you want to poach

607
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,168
your script you have rather to you PI

608
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,380
crap totem which is which are maintained

609
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:03,940
and the fixed route knowledge is that PI

610
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,289
crypto had and the general-purpose

611
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,110
library for crypto operation in Python

612
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:10,610
is cryptography so from the early

613
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,539
version the first version of this year

614
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:17,899
study by crypto was had a biggest a big

615
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:20,210
sorry I had a big share and the share is

616
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:22,969
trying to be reduced which is a good

617
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,880
news but still it's represent like

618
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:29,570
thirty person of crypto usage in our

619
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,630
Python tour so so please stop stop you

620
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:35,330
that

621
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:39,960
but Viraj that's sorry that's library

622
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,580
and the last part of this study so I'm

623
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,220
showing you I'm giving you all the

624
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:48,840
references here the last part of this

625
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:51,570
study is to focus again in Titan

626
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,809
libraries because I wanted to see if

627
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:58,080
what was the the ijen of our Python tool

628
00:30:54,809 --> 00:31:02,070
out there vulnerable to a lot of stuff

629
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,039
are we using dependencies that has some

630
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:09,090
CVE do we maintain do we increase and do

631
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:13,169
we maintain actively our requirements

632
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:16,340
dot txt and to be frank item some

633
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:19,770
surprise here because I've seen a lot of

634
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:24,389
project so for this part of the study I

635
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:26,520
have used the PI up dot IO rule now

636
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,340
ready databases it's focused for python

637
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,549
libraries and I crossed and I joined

638
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,428
this data set with my data sets to see

639
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:39,900
how many project had their dependencies

640
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:42,570
vulnerable to some cv and the the first

641
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,120
library the most preferred library that

642
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,610
we use n which is vulnerable and not

643
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,100
maintained is jungle for building a web

644
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:53,370
server then we have request which is

645
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,860
using as you seen as you have seen the

646
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:59,428
favorite library to perform some HTTP

647
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,219
request and then we have we have a lot

648
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:04,770
of different libraries that we don't

649
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:09,799
maintain anymore and we don't upgrade

650
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,799
their number in requirement at 60 and

651
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:20,158
here you can see in this figure that

652
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:24,299
this is the representation of the Vanara

653
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,250
which is per python dependency so here

654
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:29,549
you can find you can see that request

655
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,919
this cv is related to request and is

656
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:36,299
really present in a lot of deeper in a

657
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,520
lot of repositories so again please fix

658
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:43,889
and maintain your requirement at sixty

659
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:47,370
and stop this kind of declaration you

660
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:52,679
know it is not good because it fixed it

661
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:54,840
yet it this is a strict requirements and

662
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,409
it cannot if you use this tool it

663
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,889
doesn't allow you to upgrade the jungle

664
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:04,110
version and because it it gives you a

665
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:07,260
static reference to a version so please

666
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:09,030
use at least superior than this version

667
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,879
I know you can have some compatibility

668
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:15,600
issues but still don't use equal equal

669
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:24,950
because it it it fixes some some stuff

670
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:28,199
in requirement at sixteen so you may ask

671
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:30,540
yeah cool this industry huh it may be

672
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,490
useful maybe not I don't know but anyway

673
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,649
everything including this presentation

674
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:38,429
is already available on my github so

675
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:40,280
I've made it to be to be repeatable so

676
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:43,140
today you can take the project and

677
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,389
replay it by your home hopefully it

678
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,870
won't break this is the power of that I

679
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,500
could just you just have to play to to

680
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,559
press

681
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,600
build and it will build a whole the

682
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,820
whole study updating the figures

683
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,270
updating the data sets of the English

684
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,720
shots so here you can find so the

685
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:06,870
project slide the project that that a

686
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,720
good project and some significant data

687
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:13,500
sets that you've seen today to be

688
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:15,509
exported and if you can if there's any

689
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,550
usage of this as that I said for your

690
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,470
study for your own study I would be more

691
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,570
than happy but J I released everything

692
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:24,569
so everything is available with the

693
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:27,060
tutorial so how to install that iku and

694
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:29,460
to import the project and so so I'm open

695
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:33,989
to to your contribution and to and for

696
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,879
your your remark about this project and

697
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,129
then for the last part of my

698
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,210
presentation which is which should

699
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:46,409
should be to be frank should have is

700
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:49,440
owned his own presentation is the golden

701
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:52,139
rules from my point of view for modern

702
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,269
tours if you want yours to be modern

703
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,460
easy to use easy to install easy to

704
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:58,410
contribute to so please follow this kind

705
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,390
of rule I think you're all experienced

706
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,339
like Mira you wanted to use a tool and

707
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,470
in your environment it doesn't work it

708
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:07,200
doesn't compile you cannot install it

709
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,930
you cannot contribute it breaks stuff it

710
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,220
doesn't support proxy whatever so I try

711
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:16,140
to list all the problem everyone as a

712
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,578
community we've been facing before I

713
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:23,069
think so first please pass pass some

714
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,470
argument with some standard library in

715
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:27,210
Python each it's called hoc pass the

716
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,029
previous one but which was called opt

717
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:33,869
pass so please use our pass and make

718
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:35,130
your script accepting arguments with the

719
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:39,749
standard library you'll see it's very

720
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:41,759
easy to do then as an input a lot of

721
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:44,430
scrip I are accepting only a single

722
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:47,519
entry just please if you want your tool

723
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:50,160
to scale accept an input file with

724
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:54,209
around 1 on 3 per line and it would be

725
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,149
better build it with modularity to twist

726
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,890
public contributions from my point of

727
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,099
view I think I don't know if you know

728
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:06,538
the tool reckonin g4 reckonin sense icon

729
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,039
- Angie I think it's pretty well

730
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,289
developed and it's based really on

731
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:13,319
modularity and each plug-in for each

732
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:15,749
each thing each side to be grabbed and

733
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,089
to be collected is built ready with a

734
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:20,368
good framework and to me it's a good

735
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,890
example of how you want to develop your

736
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,289
own tool if you want to is public

737
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,930
contribution

738
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:31,049
please also provide some easy to pass

739
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:34,109
output in sales with JSON please know

740
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:36,029
Excel where this is not modern at all

741
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,619
from my point of view CSV or G's

742
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:40,950
ancestry for human reason is for

743
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,349
programs but really please allow

744
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,319
standard output

745
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:48,119
make it please not everyone I - I think

746
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:49,440
you you you will better understand my

747
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,680
point of view here then maybe in the

748
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,619
u.s. we have accents in our shaft sets

749
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,710
please use utf-8 with this is coming

750
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,839
from a French guy so really make it make

751
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,110
it usable worldwide and not only in the

752
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:05,320
US

753
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,160
use for performance in synchronous

754
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,580
execution

755
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,129
thus simple rules for this if it's if

756
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,950
your program is IO bonded you have to

757
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:17,140
use a multi thread if it is CPU bonded

758
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,750
you have to use a multi processing in

759
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,279
Python this is in Python 3 and even

760
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,990
tuned right now because it has been back

761
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,350
ported there's a stander and cool

762
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,819
library which is called concurrent

763
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,569
concurrent that features and it allows

764
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,640
easily

765
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:34,060
you've seen my project I've used it I've

766
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,180
using it a lot to perform some multiple

767
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,009
process I've been using a lot Compu on

768
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,839
that futures and it has two subclasses

769
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,500
for merge is read in which it processing

770
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:47,230
it's really easy to use trust me provide

771
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:51,400
multiple verbosity level like from info

772
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:53,230
to warning to debug for for users to be

773
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,280
able to to understand what's going on

774
00:37:53,230 --> 00:38:00,340
for failures please in our copper word

775
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,860
cooperates world lots of thing is based

776
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,930
on Windows please in your tool if it

777
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,030
does some internal scanning internal

778
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,450
stuff please support ntlm authentication

779
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:12,930
at least please if you are even better

780
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:16,509
please support Kerberos opacification

781
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:19,750
please also support HTTP proxy traversal

782
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:23,890
to be able to to go outside of your

783
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,360
cooperate environments if it's even

784
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,160
better if you support socks proxy

785
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,130
fication

786
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,410
its reeyou SFIL for everyone as we've

787
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,320
seen it's just before just don't use and

788
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:37,600
maintain please your dependencies being

789
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,290
for branching people the possibility to

790
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:44,740
upgrade their code and to maintain it in

791
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,360
the long run sorry package your tool

792
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,819
please package the tool in make it's

793
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,310
easily installable there's a lot of

794
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,470
tutorials to build a pip Python pip

795
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,110
package is pretty easy

796
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:59,250
publish your tool and your package on

797
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:01,870
piped organ could be easier for everyone

798
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,750
in the same way please provide

799
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:07,299
pre-built binaries if you

800
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:10,570
if you compile if you develop some some

801
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,460
compiler barcode or containers there's

802
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,220
the office as we've seen just before the

803
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,930
car is having better and better

804
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,209
represented representation in our

805
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:23,080
community a lot of people are publishing

806
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:25,630
the other Co file ready to be installed

807
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,790
and it's it helps attackers and

808
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,369
defenders so I've seen some people

809
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:33,430
saying that providing free build stuff

810
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:35,650
helps attackers only and no this is not

811
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,598
true you have to help defenders also

812
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,890
because different just has to attack

813
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,780
their home platform to be able to

814
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,609
understand what would be going on so

815
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,790
they don't have time to spend to build

816
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:47,710
your your your your program in your

817
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:51,310
audio tube chain so please provide

818
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:55,210
pre-built stuff please and in the end

819
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:58,380
encrypt traffic so to be you you build

820
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:01,480
some secure some security tools you have

821
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,190
they have to be secure this tool has to

822
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,810
be secure and it has to encrypt traffic

827
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:23,618
