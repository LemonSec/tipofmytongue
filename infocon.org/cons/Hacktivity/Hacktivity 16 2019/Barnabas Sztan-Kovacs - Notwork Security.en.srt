1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
hello everyone I hope you are enjoying

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,380
the conference my name is Barnabas

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,140
tymkovich

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,480
and this presentation is about network

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,670
security the title might suggest

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,530
otherwise but my talk will not be about

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,990
boring Network vulnerabilities and

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,619
exploits but hopefully less boring

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,060
stories of the info circuitry how

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,460
systems got pwned in the past and other

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,098
stories we are doing the fact that it's

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,289
kind of late in the afternoon this will

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,960
be an easier talk with epic fails

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,700
instead of hardcore hacking also feel

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,270
free to join the slider channel during

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,670
the talk you can find the handle at the

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,719
bottom of the slides it's activity if

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,059
it's horrible and in the meantime you

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,670
can discuss how bad my presentation is

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,190
but if you had any questions we'll go

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,600
through them at the end of the talk and

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,940
I try my best to answer them so one of

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,899
my main aspirations to put this

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,298
presentation together was the bio of one

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,000
of my best friend's Twitter account

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,150
since I forgot to ask for his consent I

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,619
to try to make it as gdpr compliant as

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,710
possible so here's his page stating

29
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:23,009
security is sexy so when I first saw

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:27,658
this I thought well if security is sexy

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,369
it must look something like this no

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,650
stink bugs were harmed in the making of

33
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,960
this presentation actually the other

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,939
reason I made this presentation is when

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,189
I got in the business my colleagues

36
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,350
always joked around the financing some

37
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,619
hilarious stuff that happened somewhere

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,820
in the history scene for security and

39
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,670
most of the time I didn't get the

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,008
reference and I really hate it when I

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,979
don't get the joke and I have to ask but

42
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,899
why is it funny and they only go like oh

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,229
it's too long and they proceed with

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,990
their businesses and if there are any of

45
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,729
you who have ever found themselves in

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,420
similar situations you know what I'm

47
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,259
talking about

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,729
so to learn some stuff about InfoSec

49
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,510
history

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,459
and I wanted to share with others so

51
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,298
they won't find themselves in situation

52
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,040
like I had and last but not least

53
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:21,930
learning from others mistakes I mean

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,909
it's free knowledge it's free experience

55
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,040
and have you learned how your neighbor's

56
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,160
server just got pwned I just save your

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,859
server as well so what's on the menu for

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,040
this talk a peek and cyber security

59
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,099
standing and importance and how it was

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,440
shifting in the past few years story on

61
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:44,339
two of the major operating systems and

62
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:49,079
how they failed a story of an antivirus

63
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,799
software the real-life but twisted don't

64
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:57,239
start and an honorable mention because I

65
00:02:52,799 --> 00:03:01,620
love my country so damn much so back to

66
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,510
the statement of security is sexy at

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,970
first glance I thought that man

68
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,440
security is totally unsexy button a

69
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,390
second time you got me thinking is

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,970
indeed a sexy or is it sexy now so for a

71
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,208
long time a couple of years ago security

72
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,419
indeed was unsexy it was rather a

73
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,910
nuisance something inconvenient that

74
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:28,400
must be done rather than something that

75
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:32,459
is worth to be worked on also it costs

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:37,109
sorry so in many cases the goal was

77
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:41,250
compliance and not secure product and it

78
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:45,000
even cost money time energy work force

79
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,430
and doesn't even know the feature and on

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,650
top of all that security is unnoticeable

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,139
only the lack of security can be seen

82
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,599
the user can't see or feel the security

83
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,489
in the product only when an attacker

84
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,849
breach happens their data gets stolen

85
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:03,900
security problem arises and then it

86
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:06,569
hurts a lot although there was a try

87
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,730
from Microsoft at the time and it was

88
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,280
actually ahead of their time when they

89
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,160
put security as one of the main goals

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,349
for developing Windows Vista and they

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,370
allegedly put a hundred million dollars

92
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:22,830
in the security development

93
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:27,690
but what most end-users felt from Vista

94
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:30,719
rarely hire instantly higher hardware

95
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,150
requirements which does user unfriendly

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,120
graphical user interface and the bad

97
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,870
user experience and the them annoying

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,680
UAC prompt actually the majority of

99
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,199
users even disabled UAC or just 32 other

100
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,610
well and basically that's just a big

101
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,379
middle finger to all that security

102
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,750
improvement all that hundred million box

103
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:57,110
as IT evolved the lack of IT security

104
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:02,009
became a growing problem in the industry

105
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:06,120
as cybercrime has actually a shift of

106
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:10,139
money put into it and I'd like to

107
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,020
mention state funding here also ethic

108
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,039
cars have developed refined and more

109
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,840
sophisticated tools with and methods and

110
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,039
it's no longer about someone downloading

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,758
some free porn dot exam the rising cost

112
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,620
of breaches and it's more than money its

113
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:33,719
reputation business trust losing

114
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:36,180
customers Prestidge the another aspect

115
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:40,319
of the security bash was Internet of

116
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,750
Things with the typo in it actually as

117
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,150
the audio goes s in IOT stands for

118
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,430
security and there are indeed lots of

119
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,739
devices with linear zero to little

120
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,710
security posing that threat on a scale

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,379
that has never seen before and

122
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,690
regulations like GD P R which left

123
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,340
companies for a pretty hefty fine if

124
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,969
they don't care about their customers

125
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,150
data security so from my point of view

126
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:08,340
it's a sorry not sorry thing at least

127
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,159
security get some attention if nothing

128
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,900
other way is done by force companies now

129
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:16,979
had to put effort in making their

130
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,859
product secure because in addition to

131
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,128
losing reputation and customers the GDP

132
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,449
are fine will be a pain in the ass and

133
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,139
most products already are in the same

134
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,940
level of functionality in terms features

135
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,490
just like social media platforms or

136
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,580
messaging

137
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,280
applications cloud services and data

138
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,250
storage so the competition has to be

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,500
taken somewhere else and it's also a

140
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,710
good opportunity for branding and

141
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,940
advertising and as users are becoming

142
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,190
more security and privacy oriented using

143
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,349
how much big data companies know about

144
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,759
them just looking at the latest scandals

145
00:06:53,349 --> 00:07:00,300
of Google or Facebook even the most

146
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,190
uninterested users in terms of security

147
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,979
we don't like to be picked or spied on

148
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,969
by very big companies or even

149
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:14,469
government's so security is sexy

150
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:17,530
nowadays next up we'll take a look at

151
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:21,039
some cases where something have done

152
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:26,739
definitely wrong in terms of security of

153
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:28,590
some product and caused massive fail MSU

154
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,539
fail on edge

155
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,570
something backfiring something that

156
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,880
becomes back a few times or something

157
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,889
that Twitter went crazy about it but

158
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,780
this last one is actually literally

159
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,139
anything because Twitter goes crazy

160
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,320
about anything so first on our list are

161
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:50,020
the operation system masterrace the

162
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,780
Linux actually I have a Linux lady

163
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,659
friend who was who once said next is

164
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,650
safe because mother only exists for

165
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:02,259
Windows thus making guy nuts secure but

166
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,909
is Linux truly more secure than Windows

167
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:08,440
well yes

168
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:11,139
but actually no first of moer exists on

169
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,440
most platforms if not all of them

170
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:17,770
windows all Nix platforms including

171
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Linux Android as well as Mac OS iOS and

172
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:25,120
even for BIOS what does make a point

173
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,900
although is since Windows is much more

174
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,750
widely used and much more complex making

175
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:35,890
possibility or more but the sheer amount

176
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:39,299
of tracks is much higher but weakest

177
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,860
link in every system is the human factor

178
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,250
mostly the human factor miss

179
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,230
configuration can open huge

180
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,040
security holes nothing and talking about

181
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,170
the bad user habits let's say someone

182
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,510
new to Linux has to develop something a

183
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,400
linux and encounters an issue and oh my

184
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,600
god I keep getting permission errors

185
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,930
let's try using this I swear a revert

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,780
back when I'm done and we all know when

187
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,920
if you've never reverted most probably

188
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,819
never and been there done that but I'm

189
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,089
not proud of it

190
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:19,560
oh no security awareness is much more a

191
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,330
security of our user is much more less

192
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:28,890
likely to get infected or hacked

193
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:30,810
regardless the used OS so you might

194
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,270
think I've already said some things but

195
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:37,739
why is the next in this presentation

196
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:44,460
it's because 2019 is year of Linux

197
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:47,310
distant but so was 2018 and 2017

198
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:50,190
I guess you see the pattern there so I

199
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,680
did some research on topic how come that

200
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,680
every year is the year of Linus desktop

201
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,800
again and actually I found the

202
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,410
information on reddit and that every

203
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,479
year is the year of Linux desktop since

204
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:09,500
1998 but I had to scroll more to find

205
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,170
that route you get it this cross truth

206
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:17,089
it was fine for me so actually the first

207
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:20,640
difference was in 1494 by Luca Pacioli

208
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:25,890
in which he says I'm sure next year

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,780
everyone will use Linux in Italian but

210
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,949
one thing is sure about Linux years and

211
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,900
that is the year of Linux security fails

212
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,390
was 2009

213
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,949
they got nominated for four ponies

214
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:44,370
awards yet here one of the most serious

215
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:48,330
vulnerabilities in Linux OS was at the

216
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,280
time was line access CT before working

217
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,240
memory corruption you can see the CV

218
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,939
number in the title to what we will see

219
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,030
are the Linux kernel development teams

220
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,920
reactions to the

221
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:07,199
stating it has an unknown impact and

222
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,740
it's causing system crash leading to

223
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,800
denial of service for some reason the

224
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,560
Linux kernel development team

225
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,930
continually assumes that or assumed that

226
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,979
memory corruption bugs are only die-off

227
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:26,339
service well just because the annika

228
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,540
could get done of service from memory

229
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,010
corruption bug that doesn't mean a

230
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,760
skilled hacker can get a root shell out

231
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,819
of it actually so a security researcher

232
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,400
who happened to be spurred exploit

233
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,460
writer also cover the case and did some

234
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,340
research on it and given that you know

235
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,600
the target kernel it's an extremely

236
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:51,390
reliable nearly one shot exploit it

237
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,290
worked on Ubuntu eight appends to the

238
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,750
eleven federal court ten and even

239
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,550
security enhance Linux which covers

240
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,060
pretty much all the popular distros at

241
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:08,819
the time and if you know the target

242
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:10,260
kernel the target could so I wanted

243
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,180
mentioning the details now how the

244
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,220
exploit work but if you want you can

245
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,920
ping me after the talk and I could I

246
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,080
will send the paper to you which covers

247
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,870
the case and it's a really amazing paper

248
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,090
because even I understood what he said

249
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,720
and it's it's something that's really

250
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:29,940
rare so the x-ray it could control the

251
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,800
slab which means a piece of the memory

252
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:37,290
and it could overwrite the side pointer

253
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,089
close to the overflowing buffer which

254
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,740
means that this slab swab is a

255
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,290
continuous piece of memory or which

256
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,370
where the pointer pointed so basically

257
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:50,550
the memory piece was the attackers and

258
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:54,690
it he could or she could even control

259
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:58,310
over Britain data in the memory feel so

260
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,950
that's pretty much game over actually

261
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:06,180
but let me mention another one same year

262
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:09,870
same operating system any a local I'm

263
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,060
privileged user may have sent a unicast

264
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,750
or multicast

265
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,239
netlink message to Uwe the message is

266
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,060
treated as a privileged message from the

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,060
colonel as mesogens on net link socket

268
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:26,119
always come from the colonel so this was

269
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,949
all the user for example instruct you

270
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,680
deftly to create the dev random device

271
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,680
file with chosen minor and major device

272
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,229
numbers giving readwrite execution

273
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,510
permissions to any device that the

274
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,450
etiquette chooses and again that's game

275
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,360
over pwned

276
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:47,270
so in 2009 thanks to the pretty good

277
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,970
year for by workflow resulting in

278
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,360
reliable remote deserving of security

279
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,880
and hence Linux they happen to

280
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,840
improperly patch seven year local bypass

281
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:03,250
offload aslr implementation on arbitrary

282
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,530
route command execution we an

283
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,810
environment variable and scientist

284
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:13,130
closures of Emeril's kernel

285
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,449
vulnerabilities boon style points to

286
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,390
reinstall vault

287
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,770
actually it was a year before in 2008

288
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:24,110
but still who said I personally consider

289
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:26,930
security bugs to be just normal buttons

290
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,670
and I don't have the reason to think

291
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,939
it's a good idea to track them and

292
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,920
announce them as something special

293
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,590
also he said I refused to bother with

294
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,079
the whole security circus is if I think

295
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,050
it glorifies and does encourages the

296
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,750
wrong behavior because it makes heroes

297
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,990
out of security people as if the people

298
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,050
who just fixed normal bugs aren't as

299
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:53,030
important I'm not saying he doesn't have

300
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:57,319
a point though and I mention this later

301
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:59,810
in the presentation so these kinds of

302
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,940
jokes were proof trending on Twitter a

303
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:06,890
few months ago so I to the courage to

304
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,410
make want you if he says all kernel

305
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:13,970
memory corruption issues are only denial

306
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:17,530
service issues and he doesn't handle

307
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:21,530
bugs because it's an unknown impact and

308
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:23,810
security bugs are just normal bugs then

309
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,410
he's not your guy he's the guy from the

310
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,410
Linux kernel of

311
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,280
so before linux fanboys before the

312
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,110
furious linux fanboys you raid me after

313
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,930
the presentation let me best mean those

314
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:42,380
little too stupid egg disease stupid

315
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,810
users exist i mean the two and there are

316
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,110
a lot more of them not only in sheer

317
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,569
numbers but also as a percentage of the

318
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,120
total users too so I'd like to mention

319
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,000
some in famous names that Microsoft

320
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,320
Windows had to deal with or dealt with

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,280
with Terry in a terribly wrong way

322
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:07,520
first is configure and Donna de going by

323
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,890
other names too in 2008 this firm

324
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,569
utilized the Windows Server service

325
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:17,030
overflow going by the number and

326
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:22,640
infected most of the Internet Windows

327
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:25,939
desktops or the course of six months the

328
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,790
bug itself like most of the good flaws

329
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,950
in Microsoft products were found in the

330
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,230
wild and it was being exploited in the

331
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:36,860
wild for an unknown period of time

332
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:40,460
because before getting to the Microsoft

333
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,890
Security Response Team actually

334
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,710
configure managed to infect everything

335
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:48,560
from the UK air force to the city of

336
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:51,220
Houston's Municipal Court along with

337
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,380
millions of systems in the team and

338
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,930
weren't forced the court system is to

339
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,890
shut down and always had to stop making

340
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,510
arrests for minor offenses such as

341
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,180
speeding and minor drug possession so it

342
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:09,020
was a gift a to all the small-time drug

343
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,000
dealers and racers although conficker

344
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,349
was over hyped it was still one of the

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:20,569
worst worms of 2008 and pressed shooting

346
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:24,439
for half a year the second one is flame

347
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:27,500
happened in 2012 flame was pretty cool

348
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:31,190
at the time since it wasn't only a bug

349
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,580
but some people Fe was involved - long

350
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,450
story short attackers or flame authors

351
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,399
have found a week

352
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,159
and exploitable Microsoft certificate

353
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:43,739
with code signing enabled which

354
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:47,580
basically means they found a pot of gold

355
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:51,570
with some rainbow at the end and one of

356
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,539
the Microsoft terminal server signing

357
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,799
lights and signing services something

358
00:17:54,539 --> 00:18:01,980
like that still used md5 hashing which

359
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,250
had code signing enable - and the ethic

360
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,320
was following the ethical had to create

361
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,860
a counterfeit copy of the certificate

362
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,860
and use it for code signing some of the

363
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,610
components in the malware the next step

364
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,100
well this makes your code peer like it

365
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,279
originated from Microsoft which means

366
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,469
that you can pretty much follow any

367
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,919
Windows machines to Windows Update I'd

368
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,899
call it a ten out of ten move so

369
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,980
Microsoft had learned the hard way that

370
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:37,408
md5 is obsolete and all they had to do

371
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,210
was to visit the page stop using md5

372
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:44,279
now.com but they didn't next up wanna

373
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:51,679
cry I'm sure everyone has heard of wanna

374
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:54,830
cry so when a cry was in 2016 and

375
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,820
shutting down German training structure

376
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,059
everything from German strains

377
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,610
infrastructure to the UK's NHS was

378
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,460
literally child's play for it but what

379
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:09,320
was the causes well take a legacy bug

380
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,029
which has patches available and the lead

381
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,820
Nautilus a zero-day that exploit about

382
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:18,750
mentioned before and make it from cone

383
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:21,299
country where the offensive cyber units

384
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,870
I our test with bringing in their own

385
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:27,168
revenue basically making their living

386
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,158
and their families living out of it

387
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:33,570
despite all the destruction it was

388
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:36,029
pretty read and a work that all makes

389
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,158
old ones like configure and Maurice firm

390
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:40,950
looks like children toys because it

391
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:43,950
demanded ransom it came from

392
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:47,539
nation-state actors use vulnerabilities

393
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,539
in untouched Microsoft Windows systems

394
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:55,230
and it was extremely aggressive like all

395
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,350
arms are muscle and I'd like to refer

396
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,790
back now what Linus said because the guy

397
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,100
who stopped by the cry was actually

398
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,620
researcher going by the nickname mob

399
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,860
attack and actually he's not a hero

400
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:12,000
he just did his daily job registering

401
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,000
the domain that caused the firm to stop

402
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,850
and not only his sandbox but all over

403
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,830
the world but he got ten grands from

404
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,929
hacker one three years of Pizza

405
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,810
and all the media attention he didn't

406
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,930
want because they he got arrested by the

407
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,639
FBI later and the personal favorite of

408
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,210
mine which I encountered by reading

409
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:37,200
about Microsoft was this one the

410
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:40,410
Internet Explorer eight implements anti

411
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,110
cross-site scripting filter a mechanism

412
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,780
which can detect certain types of

413
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,000
cross-site scripting attacks the filter

414
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,280
was so effective in fact that when

415
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,680
abused by attackers faked cross-site

416
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,260
scripting effects could even block the

417
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,880
embedded JavaScript on the page

418
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:01,110
therefore disabling client-side security

419
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,300
mechanisms therefore enable cross-site

420
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,040
scripting on websites and web pages that

421
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,669
will be otherwise immune to cross-site

422
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,740
scripting for example framing and

423
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:13,470
clicking attacks were available this way

424
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,720
but I think it's still amazing how given

425
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:20,670
Microsoft can be sometimes okay let's

426
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,990
take a break from scolding operation

427
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,250
systems even a title reading even after

428
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,090
reading the title McAfee Antivirus

429
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,220
shouldn't need any comments I'm sure how

430
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,379
about that many of you have tried to

431
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,270
avoid it like the plague it got

432
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,630
installed it literally all kinds of

433
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,790
software or they even did the checkbox

434
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,360
weapon trick when you actually had to

435
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:47,460
click the check box do not install it so

436
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,169
what did McAfee do wrong in addition of

437
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,280
slowing the PC and giving a hard time to

438
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:55,860
uninstall well McAfee requires can alert

439
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,920
in 2008 along with their service code

440
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,629
hacker save this hacker safe service

441
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,049
gives certificate

442
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,730
give a certification on your website

443
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,389
that it was hacker safe you know safe

444
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,850
from hackers

445
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,570
but how did they insure it that it was

446
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,168
hacker safe

447
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:16,470
well according to an interview scan

448
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:19,289
alert went in like a super hacker like a

449
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,750
super hacker at irregular but the

450
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:24,210
 super hacker and super hacked

451
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,390
your website then it checked for

452
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,330
cross-site scripting and SQL injections

453
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,130
misconfigurations bashing issues then

454
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,129
true out or the cross-site scripting

455
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,919
flaws if he didn't is them already but

456
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,779
why well as they stated cross-site

457
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,389
scripting can be used to hack a server

458
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,669
you may be able to do other things with

459
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:47,428
it you may be able to do things that

460
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:49,200
affect the end user or the client but

461
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:52,169
the customer data is protected within

462
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,389
the server and the database and it's not

463
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:58,049
going to be compromised by prosecuting

464
00:22:54,389 --> 00:23:00,178
not directly then you get a shiny

465
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:04,850
certification badge that your site is

466
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:08,220
heckard safe talking about McAfee

467
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:14,010
another small incident happened on the

468
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:15,750
21st of April in 2010 when mcafee

469
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,510
virusscan Enterprise push that

470
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,419
definition update this update affected

471
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,639
Windows XP machines from Service Pack 1

472
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,639
2 3 so pretty much all the Windows XP

473
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:29,908
versions at the time and according to

474
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:33,269
McAfee it could result in a moderate to

475
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:35,809
significant performance issue well as

476
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:38,940
for the definition update Microsoft

477
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:41,760
mcafee virusscan Enterprise identified

478
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,970
the Windows core component services exa

479
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,059
as a trojan so it did what a good

480
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,220
antivirus does current ended shut down

481
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,820
the machine after this when he turned on

482
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,100
the PC Windows couldn't be loaded which

483
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,250
resulted in endless tributes cycle so

484
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,350
indeed I agree with McAfee

485
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:06,440
moderate performance issue is your man

486
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:09,510
your PC gets break so the McAfee

487
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,720
Antivirus had some rough days in its

488
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,610
history but what about its name giver

489
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,370
let's take a look at one of the most

490
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:21,540
notorious characters in history of info

491
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:23,909
SEC John McAfee actually it's

492
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:27,360
not it's David but who haven't

493
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:36,230
seen the video hands up oh I see

494
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:36,229
someone's okay we watch the video and oh

495
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:43,320
hello there my name is shawn mcafee I'm

496
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,720
the founder of the McAfee Antivirus

497
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,310
software company although I've had

498
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,430
nothing to do with this company for over

499
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:53,790
15 years I still get the volumes of mail

500
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:56,040
asking how do I uninstall this software

501
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:59,389
I have no idea

502
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,389
[Music]

503
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:10,850
[Music]

504
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:12,800
I really need to quit as I said I've had

505
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,490
nothing to do with McAfee software for

506
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:22,159
over 15 years I've had more pressing

507
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:25,430
things to do but recent events have made

508
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,970
me change my mind I've had over the

509
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,980
years many responses from users who are

510
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,990
complaining about the difficulty in

511
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:38,030
removing the software I'd like to read

512
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:39,590
you a few things holy I was

513
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,530
drawing for like 5 hours straight on

514
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,860
this marvellous drawing and I had to do

515
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,700
a big ass scan that slows the out

516
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,889
of my computer

517
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,140
it was McAfee of course my computer's

518
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,970
always really fast but that son of a

519
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,580
bitch has to come it up here's

520
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,860
another my free trial for McAfee or

521
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,179
however it's spelled expired when it

522
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,419
expired it blocked

523
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,850
pornhub McAfee them in their

524
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,880
stupid faces I hope they all get dick

525
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,429
and Khun rot and die a slow agonizing

526
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,260
death for limiting my porn use 2x

527
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,290
hamster no one should have to use

528
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,660
xhampster I tried one final time and got

529
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:21,050
the Urban Dictionary definition for

530
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,880
McAfee McAfee a barely passable virus

531
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:26,360
scanning program that updates at the

532
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
worst possible times tends to render

533
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,780
your computer completely useless

534
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,670
whenever it starts an update which it

535
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:35,030
doesn't ask to start and you cannot

536
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:37,850
cancel or pause McAfee updates at

537
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:40,190
horrible times almost like the creator's

538
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,790
want you to die

539
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,560
so I finally remembered how to uninstall

540
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:48,230
Maccabee antivirus software and I've

541
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,679
asked my friend Bartholomew to walk you

542
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,180
through the steps this is my lab tech

543
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,340
Bartholomew he's going to take you

544
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,860
through step by step the process of

545
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,790
uninstalling the McAfee Antivirus

546
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:03,909
software we'll say hello Bartholomew yes

547
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:07,760

548
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:09,440
good luck the procedure for removing

549
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,660

yes Bartholomew back it up um sir should

553
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,460
I be reading the instructions for the

554
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:29,780
Mac or PC they're really quite different

555
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,850

556
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,490

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:59,540
removal tool John huh yes that's that

565
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,460
about right well not completely you know

566
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,350
I mean it's always there it's watching

567
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,730
it's been watching me for years every

568
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,260
time I turn on the computer it's

569
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,210
there looking at me you know something

570
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,620
went wrong 15 years ago I had some

571
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,000
beautiful software and they took it over

572
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,600
I don't know what they did it was like

573
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,950
the time I hired that Bangkok prostitute

574
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,510
to do my taxes while I my

575
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,040
accountant it was terrible

576
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,510
the same thing is going on now

577
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,200
but I know what to do I know exactly

578
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,000
what to do

579
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:33,890
believe me I've got life

580
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,890
[Music]

581
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:52,740
so back to mcafee the reason actually I

582
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:54,150
put McAfee in the presentation is first

583
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,270
of all don't get me wrong I don't want

584
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,340
to praise him and I think he's indeed a

585
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,470
total medal act but look at this guy's

586
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,790
biography that's why I said he was a

587
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,570
real lifetime sorry because he's so

588
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:09,540
 crazy

589
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:12,870
he's born in 45 is 74 years old he ran

590
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,800
for president in 2016 and plans to run

591
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:19,550
for president in 2020

592
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:22,889
taught yoga and wrote books about yoga

593
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:25,320
considers himself as a prime target for

594
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:28,230
the IRS the Internal Revenue Service

595
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,370
because he doesn't pay taxes since 2010

596
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:35,190
and for hackers just outsourcing all

597
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,530
computer related purchases to other

598
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:41,190
people and changing his IP addresses

599
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,840
several times every day and doesn't even

600
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,930
use his antivirus carrying his name

601
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:51,030
because it's the worst software on the

602
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:54,090
planet additionally he has 47 biological

603
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:57,240
children and stated on Twitter that he

604
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,010
would literally eat his meat if Bitcoin

605
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,250
want to reach a million dollars by the

606
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,640
end of 2020 for the curious guys out

607
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,400
there

608
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,710
bitcoin is around 8,000 dollars now so

609
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,860
McAfee has like 14 months left to have

610
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:14,010
Bitcoin worth 125 times its present

611
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:18,689
value so I started investing back

612
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:21,240
Bitcoin and if the AV didn't make his

613
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:26,460
name fame then this guy is a total metal

614
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,320
by itself so bit fee I don't know who

615
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,690
have heard about bit fee but the reason

616
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,470
McAfee here is bit we actually the whole

617
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:36,750
stuff happened year ago in the summer

618
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:39,450
with is the worst first unhackable

619
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,120
storage for cryptocurrency and digital

620
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:45,030
assets and there's nothing like McAfee

621
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,669
protecting your unhackable us being so

622
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:50,460
sure of this unhackable trade McAfee set

623
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:51,450
up a bounty of a hundred grands which

624
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,940
later increased

625
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,720
your quarter-million dollars with the

626
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,190
scope so narrow that it's in completable

627
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,680
Hecker's had to recover a key from an

628
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:05,640
unaltered device that doesn't store a

629
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,920
key so it's an impossible bounty but

630
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,960
still you had if you wanted to

631
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,780
participate you had to buy the device

632
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,130
for a hundred and twenty bucks and an

633
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,670
addition of fifty bucks

634
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:21,450
to ensure serious inquiries so I guess

635
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:23,640
it's a nice marketing move but security

636
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:27,450
researcher outraged and pointed out that

637
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,250
the whole bounty is a sham because the

638
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,190
reasons I mentioned before in the term

639
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,860
and hackable is a false claim at the

640
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:40,170
time bit fee insisted that to the term

641
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:41,699
and hackable so according this at the

642
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,300
time bit field didn't count the

643
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,390
following points as being hacked John

644
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,000
McAfee displayed on the device getting

645
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,700
root access on the device playing

646
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,060
 doom on the device and this was

647
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,070
a 15 year old guy actually modifying the

648
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,350
device recording then sending the

649
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:04,710
private key to a malicious third party

650
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,840
and actually hacking the device as close

651
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,630
as possible the way bit we wanted it to

652
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,949
be hacked but I guess it doesn't count

653
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,830
as being hacked because they still

654
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:16,740
didn't pay the bounty so by the time the

655
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:21,439
system was so hard that security

656
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:24,450
researchers and Twitter blown up and in

657
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,090
response bit fee removed the claim that

658
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,340
their device is unhackable because it

659
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,820
caused a significant amount of

660
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:36,090
controversy and closed their currency

661
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,189
bounty programs because it have caused

662
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,250
understandable danger and frustration

663
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:44,730
issues among researchers well John

664
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,760
McAfee taunted and bent all this

665
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,550
 on a researcher

666
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,590
offering cryptocurrency worth of twenty

667
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,290
million dollars on his betray all that

668
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:57,780
praying travel fees for this researcher

669
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,940
for literally going up to this house and

670
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:03,990
hacking the device which I mentioned

671
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,190
earlier was impossible deal and another

672
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,600
Twitter user pointed out

673
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:11,340
that there's no point in kicking a dead

674
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,740
horse and accidentally calling McAfee a

675
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,740
wannabe in the process only to get

676
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:21,210
schooled by McAfee himself stating he

677
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:23,760
 invented cybersecurity do not

678
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,560
mess with John McAfee so after

679
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,170
that the guy elaborated on his comment

680
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:33,659
making McAfee feel so bad about himself

681
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:37,170
that he actually apologized so the

682
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:40,410
honorable mention it's not just security

683
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,570
but also PR fail and it's really close

684
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:45,600
to my heart it's a hilarious example of

685
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,780
how things can happen around here more

686
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,820
than two years ago in 2017 the bit of s

687
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,100
Transport Authority I will refer to it

688
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:57,689
as BK k launched the first version of

689
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:00,870
their online ticketing system and we

690
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:06,060
didn't have to make watch much to have

691
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:08,940
it phone like one day or so so high

692
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,870
school student found the vulnerability

693
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,240
when one could wear one could buy

694
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:17,069
anything for an arbitrary PI's for

695
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,250
demonstration he bought the multi pass

696
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,680
which goes for nine and a half K kilo

697
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,889
for ends and he bought it for fifty for

698
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:30,239
ins which indeed wasn't big trick

699
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:32,790
because the big hack only consisted of

700
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,459
modifying the post data which is not a

701
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:39,060
really hard thing but the problem was

702
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:42,090
that the was basically zero validation

703
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:45,150
throughout the whole process also this

704
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,670
vicious hacker happen to be living 300

705
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,610
kilometres away never used the pass and

706
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:53,280
said he wouldn't use and reported the

707
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:57,060
issue immediately but still got

708
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,340
prosecuted by the operating company T

709
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,740
systems Hungary and was arrested at his

710
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,330
home have their digital assets

711
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:07,470
confiscated you know the usual stuff

712
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:10,680
what happens but wait there's more the

713
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,600
system also stored all credentials like

714
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,779
email and password in a clear text

715
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,930
format and one could have logged in with

716
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,009
default admin credentials

717
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:25,910
and had all access to all user data in

718
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:30,160
the system and they used HTTP for

719
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:32,828
sending credentials in 2017 and

720
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,390
from the operation standpoint

721
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:37,849
anyone who abused the ticketing system

722
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,190
was breaking the law and technically it

723
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:42,410
was true but I don't think any black hat

724
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,720
with good of secure would go ahead and

725
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,009
prosecute himself for stealing the whole

726
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,879
database and selling it on the black

727
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:55,700
market so another issue for the list of

728
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,289
issues is copying passes was easy and

729
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,200
most ticket inspectors didn't have the

730
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:02,180
equipment to check it and NGO even tried

731
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,999
to board the public transport vehicles

732
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:08,390
with copied passes and succeed out ten

733
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:10,749
out of ten times the story has a happy

734
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,339
ending though at least for some people

735
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:15,939
because the accusations and charges were

736
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:18,319
dropped against the high school student

737
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,630
who bought the past 450 forums

738
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:23,299
originally the chief information

739
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:27,200
security officer from the operators

740
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:29,930
company was fired and the same company

741
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,019
publicly apologized for the system

742
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:36,499
creating and tried the whole incident

743
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:38,749
the social media pages of both the bkk

744
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:41,629
and t-systems hungary were taken under

745
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:43,970
one star rating heavy artillery fire

746
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,299
which they haven't recovered from since

747
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,859
but hopefully this wasn't the reason why

748
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:51,440
they chose to further investigate the

749
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:54,170
issue so the moral of the story is

750
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,329
respect laws and don't go

751
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,549
self-proclaimed white setting or bounty

752
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:02,059
hunting around here at least not with

753
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:05,180
government stuff so thank you for your

754
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:07,849
attentions and if you have any questions
