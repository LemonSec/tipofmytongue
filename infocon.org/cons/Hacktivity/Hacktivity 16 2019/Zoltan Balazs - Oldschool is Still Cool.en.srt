1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,330
hi everyone do you guys enjoy activity

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,469
yes can you please repeat this with more

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,850
enthusiasm

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:20,520
yes all right cool awesome so Who am I

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:25,740
turned out that I was presenting here at

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,400
activity a lot and I believe I am the

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,159
guy who presented here the most but if

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,010
you guys don't know me I'm mostly into

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,648
offensive research when it comes to my

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,170
free time for example I am the developer

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,930
of the zombie browser toolkit I'm the

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,600
developer of the hardware 500 bypass

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,329
toolkit I created another analyzes

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,250
sandbox tool I played with some crappy

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,949
IOT devices and my exploit ended up on

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:01:00,510
600,000 IP cameras via the pursue botnet

17
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:03,809
I also invented the idea of encrypting

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,939
the web based exploits while

19
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,619
diffie-hellman key exchange and turned

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,509
out that this was used by both the

21
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,880
exploit kit developers from Russia and

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,439
also some Chinese nation state that

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,158
occurs so my presentation is about all

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,669
school stuff and you might ask why am i

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,740
interested in all school things and

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,479
there isn't great saying that those who

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,350
cannot remember the past are condemned

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,048
to repeat it

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:39,298
and during the presentation you will see

30
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:44,880
why I chose this motto so let's start

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:48,540
our journey in 1950 so who of you have

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:53,780
heard about the guide joy bubbles okay

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,140
like three people four so joy the boss

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:03,180
was one of the very first hackers on

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,250
earth basically and he was doing money

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,560
at the university by selling

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,889
long-distance calls for one US dollar

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,599
only and the way he was able to do that

39
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,420
was because he hacked

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,138
the phone system back in the days all

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:23,129
right but how can you hack phone systems

42
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:26,389
so early in the history basically the

43
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:30,480
way he created this hack was that first

44
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:34,019
you have to call 800 we are talking

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,319
about phone systems in the u.s. so first

46
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:41,060
you had to call this free but

47
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:45,980
long-distance line which starts with 800

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:51,319
then you had to play this very famous

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:57,540
2600 Hertz which sounds like this

50
00:02:51,319 --> 00:03:00,929
can you guys hear it no okay so I do not

51
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,168
use I have a application on my phone

52
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,260
which basically can simulate all these

53
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:12,150
tones but I will not use this in this

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:15,870
case and what is special sounds does in

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:20,759
these old phone systems that it detects

56
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,400
that the user basically hung up and it

57
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,668
stopped counting the minutes so from now

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,340
on you don't have to pay for it but

59
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:34,139
because of this hack you are still

60
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:38,220
connected to the line and if you just

61
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:40,709
send the key pal stone then you send the

62
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,780
new long-distance number and the start

63
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,629
tone to the system now you can get a

64
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,169
free call so basically you hack the

65
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:52,739
system and you don't have to pay for

66
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:58,439
calling long-distance lines and why was

67
00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:02,479
this able why was this hack possible in

68
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,668
the past after World War two when people

69
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:09,840
created the new phone system in the US

70
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:12,659
they wanted to save money and they

71
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,168
figured out that if they send the

72
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:20,190
control signals and the voice signal on

73
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:24,599
the very same channel then they can

74
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,370
basically save money on the equipment

75
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:29,240
and

76
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,060
all the things and this is bad because

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:39,790
whenever someone can control both the

78
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:44,360
data and the code then hacks can happen

79
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:47,389
this is joy bubbles then he is doing his

80
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,040
favorite hobby calling people on the

81
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:56,050
phone this hack is called the blue box

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,419
because later this whole hack was

83
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:03,139
created in small hardware devices called

84
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:05,810
the blue box and as of today there are

85
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,930
still many ways you can hack the phone

86
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,030
system to create free calls for example

87
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,780
when we are talking about the new VoIP

88
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,030
systems maybe you can find a VoIP system

89
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,609
on the internet check if it has any weak

90
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,760
passwords then there you go you have

91
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,130
free calls also when it comes to the

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,490
inbound signaling we should not forget

93
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:31,580
that basically all the intel and erm

94
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,430
chips that we used today they also use

95
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,310
the form element architecture where the

96
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,710
code and the data is handled on the same

97
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,870
line which means that we have memory

98
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,580
corruption exploits forever basically it

99
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,849
would be nice to use the harvard

100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,389
architecture which doesn't have this

101
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:59,000
issue but due to many reasons they were

102
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:01,789
never popular in complex chips alright

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,880
let's talk about the red box since we

104
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:11,300
are in the 60s right now whenever you

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,560
inserted your coins into a public pay

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:19,699
phone the pay phone generated a special

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,729
tone and sent this special tone to the

108
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,699
phone company system in the back end and

109
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:28,580
back end started to count the minutes

110
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,419
based on the money you inserted into the

111
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,150
pay phone so basically what you can do

112
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,719
is whenever you insert the money into

113
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,070
your pay phone you just record the sound

114
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:43,100
which is sound

115
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,500
to the back end and if you replay it you

116
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:51,020
can fool the beacon back and that you

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:55,280
inserted more money into the payphone as

118
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,000
I mentioned there are multiple apps on

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:04,299
both Google Play Store and iOS which you

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,220
can use to generate these special domes

121
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,040
also if you are really interested in

122
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,640
these very old multi-frequency phone

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:17,900
hacking there is a project called

124
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:21,110
project MF dot org which is hosted in

125
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,169
the US and you can basically dial to

126
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,510
them and play all these blue box red box

127
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,240
and other similar hacks on their

128
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,550
simulated system and they also provide

129
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,590
the schematics to you so if you really

130
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,180
really want to do this at home you can

131
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,580
build it at your home it's also

132
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,270
important to note that back in the days

133
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,810
the police thought that this is really

134
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:51,080
serious hack so whenever they found

135
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,450
someone with a red box or blue box in

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,520
their pocket they got arrested and they

137
00:07:53,450 --> 00:08:02,440
were sent to prison due to fraud how

138
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,440
many of you guys know that movie hackers

139
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:11,870
awesome cool so basically the guy is so

140
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,120
on this screenshot from the movie

141
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,970
hackers was doing the exact same hack

142
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,140
and this is how it really happened in

143
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,920
the past now if you think about what

144
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,960
kind of vulnerabilities exists today

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,780
which are similar to these red box

146
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,140
hacking you can think about for example

147
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:37,789
mobile applications which are the client

148
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:40,880
applications where the client stores the

149
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,490
money you have in your wallet and the

150
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,610
client will send this money to the

151
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,700
server and you would think who would do

152
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,230
that right that's just pretty stupid or

153
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,520
high-tech sure

154
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,490
and turns out this is a real SQLite

155
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,110
database from a real vending machine

156
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,450
application so basically the SQLite

157
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,210
database stored locally on your phone

158
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,180
was storing all the credits you have

159
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,300
topped out so you just had to basically

160
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,390
root your Android device find this

161
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,599
SQLite file change the corresponding

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:27,199
columns and you get free chocolate or

163
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:29,870
coke from the vending machine now this

164
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,420
is a very interesting hack called

165
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:37,460
one called restriction the story is that

166
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:42,140
this hack was again invented by joy

167
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:45,050
bubbles when he was 17 years old and the

168
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,780
story goes like that he had a very mean

169
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,880
babysitter and the babysitter didn't

170
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:53,680
really like that joy bubbles was playing

171
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:57,260
a lot with the phone so this babysitter

172
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,640
basically locked the rotary rotary dial

173
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:04,130
on the phone but joy bubbles was really

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,189
consistent that we really wanted to use

175
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:11,630
the phone so he figured out that if he

176
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:15,110
tapped on the switch hook in the same

177
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,390
pattern as the signals are sent to the

178
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,310
phone system then he can basically die

179
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:24,530
off the phone numbers he wants to and

180
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:28,969
for example what you it's very hard to

181
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:31,459
tap very long phone numbers but luckily

182
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:36,140
there are short numbers which you can

183
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,450
use to get a nice lady and you can tell

184
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,880
the nice lady that please call me this

185
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:44,710
number which is a long number so you can

186
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,350
tap the short numbers and get a call

187
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:54,160
again hackers this guy was arrested and

188
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:59,780
he only had right to call his lawyer but

189
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:03,110
after the rotary dial was locked he was

190
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,650
able to tap a phone number and call

191
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,650
anyone

192
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,980
I believe this one called

193
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:15,430
restriction is again very similar to you

194
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:18,710
weak form of client-side security checks

195
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:22,880
for example if you try to validate in a

196
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:25,970
web application the HTTP parameters on

197
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,029
the client side for example once I

198
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,339
tested a web application and when I

199
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:34,939
entered the famous a posture of

200
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:38,839
character for SQLite injection exploit

201
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:42,410
into one of the fields it was actually

202
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,779
the login form then I got back an

203
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,290
incident JavaScript alert that this

204
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:51,640
character is forbidden so I instantly

205
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:55,279
checked what can I do if I don't use

206
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,339
JavaScript I turn it off can I send this

207
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,810
character to the server turned out I can

208
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:06,560
and turned out the server side was not

209
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:09,410
checking these special characters they

210
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,560
were not using any kind of protection

211
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:15,860
against SQL injection so I was able to

212
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,969
execute any kind of SQL query on the

213
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,280
database but the developers really

214
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,620
thought that they have protected against

215
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,230
this vulnerability because on the user

216
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:33,260
interface you are not allowed to input

217
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:33,770
any apostrophe when it comes to phone

218
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,680
phreaking

219
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:41,990
we also have to mention Captain Crunch

220
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:48,650
and he was really famous that he really

221
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:53,270
liked to phone by basically anonymizing

222
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:57,620
his phone call by using hops between

223
00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:00,500
these vital telephone services and this

224
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:05,540
is basically the very first tour network

225
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:09,080
if you think about this way and once he

226
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:13,280
had an interview and he basically called

227
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,880
himself on through multiple hots and he

228
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:21,259
was able to receive his call on

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,120
other phone and when he said hello in

230
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:25,610
one of the phones it took like 15

231
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,399
seconds to hear it back on the other

232
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,480
part of the phone because he wrote it

233
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,759
his phone call through the whole earth

234
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,699
and if you are into the Snickers movie

235
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:41,389
you have seen the very same technique

236
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:44,180
used in that movie but as far as I know

237
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:47,000
at that time this hack didn't really

238
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:53,209
work anymore and it was able to trace

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,699
back discourse easily besides all of

240
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:59,268
these do box and read books and other

241
00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:02,149
hacking methods there was another very

242
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:05,949
interesting way how hackers could gain

243
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,509
free long distance calls in the u.s.

244
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,839
back in the days there were some very

245
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:15,589
small phone companies who didn't had any

246
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,680
budget or infrastructure to build their

247
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,620
own backends so they were using the

248
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,819
backend phone systems of the big

249
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,220
companies like AT&T and by default what

250
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:31,009
you had to do is that you went to a

251
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,100
local shop you bought something called

252
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:37,630
calling card number which had a six

253
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,970
digit PIN code basically and after that

254
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:46,009
what you had to do is you call the local

255
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:48,620
number which was basically operated by

256
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:52,040
this small phone company then you

257
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:55,970
entered the calling card your calling

258
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,910
card number then after that you entered

259
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,360
the long-distance area code you wanted

260
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,730
to call and the phone number this was

261
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,689
popular back in the days because using

262
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,660
this system was cheaper than using the

263
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:14,529
long-distance calls of the big companies

264
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,360
but hackers quickly figured out that

265
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:20,990
because these ping codes are pretty

266
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,110
short like six digits and many many

267
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,870
people use these calling card numbers it

268
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,750
is really easy to brute force these ping

269
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,779
codes and after you have the pink code

270
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:38,259
you can basically call a long-distance

271
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:38,259
course and someone else will pay for it

272
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,410
back in the day it was not very trivial

273
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,810
how you can automate this attack but

274
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,199
people quickly figured out that if you

275
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:55,099
if they are using modems and BBS systems

276
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,490
they can quickly automate this whole

277
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,980
hack it was also interesting that this

278
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,860
fraud was really hard to detect because

279
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,399
the logs were recorded and stored at the

280
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,079
big taco companies and they were not

281
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,930
really interested in investigating

282
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:17,120
frauds for these small four companies

283
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:20,060
another interesting way to have free

284
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,290
phone calls was something called these

285
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:27,829
test per loop numbers you have to

286
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:32,599
imagine that you call a special phone

287
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:35,089
number and if someone else cause another

288
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,839
phone number which is next to the first

289
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:42,470
one in the phones at system they are

290
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,730
connected together and this is basically

291
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:49,879
for testing debugging purposes but that

292
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,750
you don't have to pay anything so if you

293
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:57,470
basically just distribute these phone

294
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,540
numbers around your friends and they

295
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,500
call these numbers you get basically

296
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,800
free chatroulette

297
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,630
and these are these were pretty

298
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,869
interesting back in the days when there

299
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:13,030
was no internet at all but people really

300
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:13,030
wanted to communicate with each other

301
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,980
now how many of you guys ever used

302
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:26,209
bulletin board system ends up alright

303
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,709
that's that's pretty cool I have to

304
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,289
admit that the first time when I used

305
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:34,490
the BBS system was like three years ago

306
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,490
and at the beginning I really don't on

307
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:41,780
didn't understand what is going on then

308
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:43,040
I realized that these blood import

309
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,030
systems

310
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,670
are really great at doing one thing

311
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,860
because basically you have to imagine a

312
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,280
bulletin board system is that let's say

313
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:58,639
that you have a web server but it only

314
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,760
one network socket so only one client

315
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,740
can connect to your web server at a time

316
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,100
and back in the days

317
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,640
VBS is were not operated over Internet

318
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,280
tcp/ip they were called you called

319
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,680
connect to a BBS system via the phone

320
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,770
line and again this is why it was very

321
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,960
important for the hackers to hack free

322
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,750
long-distance calls because this way

323
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,250
they were able to dial in into these BBS

324
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:31,880
systems for free again back in the days

325
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:34,910
modems were not really fast so you could

326
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,960
count with 300 bits per second bottoms

327
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:44,200
so everything's was tax based people did

328
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,200
not really had any HD movies to share

329
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:51,860
luckily BBS systems are still well and

330
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,310
alive you can find a lot of VBS systems

331
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,979
on the internet so I went on and I have

332
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:02,020
registered myself to one of these baby

333
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,020
PBS systems in Houston Texas

334
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:15,040
this is running on a TI 99 I can get

335
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:19,129
back some information from my last login

336
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,399
and we are greeted with the main scream

337
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:25,100
of the BBS system I really love these

338
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,750
graphics I mean they are so beautiful I

339
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:39,559
can list who connected to the system

340
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:44,650
recently I can check what the system

341
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:51,410
administrator posted everyone to read I

342
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:54,140
can check all the BBS systems this BBS

343
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,669
system knows about here you can see for

344
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,370
example some which are running on

345
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:04,790
Commodore or running dos operating

346
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:09,678
system and last but not least you can

347
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:13,909
play games online but I really have to

348
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,880
admit that playing these games why a BBS

349
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:21,230
systems is a bit stupid because all of

350
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,600
these games are really old and didn't

351
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,020
don't you don't really need any kind of

352
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:31,370
network connectivity to play these games

353
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:34,970
you can just play these offline but

354
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:37,399
because you can and why not you can play

355
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,419
these very old text-based adventure

356
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,910
games through BBS systems luckily I was

357
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,770
using my internet connection to do that

358
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,059
so I don't have to pay for long-distance

359
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:54,049
cost to call to the US to play this one

360
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:59,379
but anyway alright let's move on and

361
00:20:54,049 --> 00:21:02,809
let's see how you can hack PBS systems

362
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,030
one very popular way back in the days

363
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:10,309
was that you created your own back door

364
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:14,450
then you created a zip file and you hex

365
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:18,770
edited your zip file and replaced the

366
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,890
fine name - dot dot slash VBS dot excel

367
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,780
and then you upload it your

368
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,060
if I to the bulletin board system

369
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,260
because they acted as a file exchange

370
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:33,159
server now what happens that the

371
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:36,640
bulletin boards is system will extract

372
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:41,430
all the files and it will basically

373
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,410
overwrite the files one directory ahead

374
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:48,010
so whenever that executable is running

375
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,690
again it will run your code and this is

376
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:57,520
how you can basically backdoor

377
00:21:49,690 --> 00:22:01,180
for example PBS systems during some

378
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,629
weekends I had some feed free time and I

379
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:09,550
wanted to create demo video on how you

380
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:13,590
can do this hack but unfortunately I was

381
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:17,080
not very lucky with this experiment but

382
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:20,800
while I was investigating this whole

383
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:25,659
hole vulnerability I found that one very

384
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:31,379
popular BBS system which was open source

385
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:33,610
in the past 20 or 40 years had serious

386
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:38,980
vulnerability

387
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:45,550
it had that file name function and as

388
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:50,140
you can see in the deep patch when ever

389
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:52,899
they listed these bad file names they

390
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:58,950
forgot to put commas between the file

391
00:22:52,900 --> 00:23:02,620
names and if you really know how C works

392
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:06,760
if you compile this program C will just

393
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:10,540
concatenate all of these names so

394
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:15,780
basically these names didn't really

395
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:18,700
appear in the final binary file so I

396
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,960
created the this whole project is on

397
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:26,200
github so I created a pull request and

398
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,930
they accepted it but I think this is

399
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,750
again a very good example of open source

400
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,860
I believe this vulnerability was there

401
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,000
for 20

402
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:39,189
years or so so it is pretty fun to find

403
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,470
such vulnerable --'tis in open source

404
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:47,320
code if you remember this hack was

405
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,720
talking about the my money to about

406
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,770
manipulating the zip fight to have a dot

407
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:57,370
dot slash filename and last year

408
00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:00,580
some researchers found that this

409
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:07,049
exploitation exists and they were really

410
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:11,080
really excited about this but this is a

411
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:13,090
modified version of their announcement

412
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,100
because originally they thought that

413
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,970
they have invented something really

414
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:22,120
really new but other people too autumn

415
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,580
yeah we used this technique to hack BBS

416
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,260
systems like 40 years ago so this is not

417
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,928
really new what you invented use not how

418
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,410
many of you guys have read any message

419
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:41,880
on a news net alright and how many of

420
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:41,880
you guys posted to Usenet okay awesome

421
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,820
Usenet was basically the very first

422
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,610
forum like functionality forum like

423
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,330
application where you could subscribe to

424
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:58,389
different groups and if you look at the

425
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,030
architecture how using servers work they

426
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:04,870
are not really modern scalable

427
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:07,450
peer-to-peer these are basically the big

428
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:11,559
servers which are syncing all the

429
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:14,950
content between each other so let's say

430
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:17,740
you have a user server in Japan in u.s.

431
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,600
in Africa and they have all the same

432
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,580
content and they are constantly

433
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,120
synchronizing the content between each

434
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:27,970
other and if you have access to one of

435
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,809
these useless servers then you can

436
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,780
subscribe to one of the groups and get

437
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:41,530
the messages from their work to post to

438
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:42,399
this group when the whole Usenet idea

439
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:46,210
was born

440
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,420
not many people used the Internet

441
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:52,120
so there was basically no administration

442
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:55,960
or filtering or any other mechanism

443
00:25:52,120 --> 00:26:00,399
built in to Usenet which meant it

444
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:04,140
quickly became a source of headache that

445
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:08,200
people just spammed the Usenet servers

446
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:11,650
especially in the US when a lot of

447
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,800
people got the eywa connection and they

448
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,780
found out that internet exists then that

449
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,860
was the time when the quality of the

450
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:23,530
Usenet groups started to decline it's

451
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:27,389
interesting to see that even though in

452
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:29,379
the beginning Usenet was architecture

453
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,960
for text-based

454
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:36,520
messages people quickly figured out that

455
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:40,360
you can split your binaries convert it

456
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:43,120
to some ASCII characters and post it on

457
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:50,800
Usenet and this is how war has started

458
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:54,899
on Usenet it was like 5 or even 10 years

459
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:58,750
ago when Napster was not popular anymore

460
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,840
because it was shot down and pod torrent

461
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:06,780
started to gain attraction and back in

462
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:11,980
that day there was a really vibrating

463
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:15,100
where as seen on the Usenet servers but

464
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,890
there was one rule of this were a scene

465
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,409
that you don't talk about Usenet because

466
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,660
they thought that if nothing too many

467
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:27,510
people know that you can do where else

468
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:31,960
on Usenet then they can evade these

469
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:34,330
copyright laws this word for a little

470
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,540
bit but at the end of the day people

471
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:45,159
found out that people are doing for us

472
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:48,480
on Usenet so this year I have subscribed

473
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,610
myself to one of these Usenet servers

474
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,580
actually you have to pay money to access

475
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:58,490
these useless servers some of our free

476
00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:01,520
trial but with the free trial you

477
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:05,900
cannot post messages to useless servers

478
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:10,100
unfortunately so because I wanted to

479
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:13,150
post a message I subscribed and I paid

480
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,219
real money to use the Usenet servers

481
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:22,790
here you can see one of the message I

482
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:25,070
posted to use that and yes you can see

483
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:29,389
there are tons of tons of different

484
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:34,129
groups on Usenet where you can find all

485
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:36,559
information one issue with Usenet is the

486
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:40,520
so called retention policy which means

487
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:44,750
that almost all servers delete old

488
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:47,629
content from the Usenet servers and if

489
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:51,140
you really want to look at all Usenet

490
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:55,220
messages you have to check places like a

491
00:28:51,140 --> 00:29:00,200
hive dot org or similar places but they

492
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:04,640
are there and it's fascinating alright

493
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,820
let's talk about the Morris worm the

494
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,440
Morris worm was developed by a guy in a

495
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:15,500
university called the Robert Morris and

496
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:19,540
this is his CV and I'd really really

497
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:23,090
love this part in his CV that in 1988

498
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:25,370
his discovery of buffer overflow first

499
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:29,959
brought the Internet to the attention of

500
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:32,300
the general public that's one way to say

501
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,420
that yeah I've wrote the first Network

502
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:41,149
forum and the internet was broken after

503
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:45,050
I released it when it comes to Morris

504
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:50,030
worm the source code of it is published

505
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:52,190
on github so I found that it will be

506
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:56,840
really really great if I can just

507
00:29:52,190 --> 00:30:00,980
download it find an emulator which I can

508
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,709
use to run this Morris worm code I

509
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:07,850
copied my source code into the operating

510
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:10,340
system I compile it run it and let's do

511
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,049
a vile shark capture between the

512
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:16,709
differences

513
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:23,320
and let's see how my verb will infect my

514
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:27,220
other old bsd machines turned out this

515
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:30,879
is not that easy because if you look at

516
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,960
the source code which was posted on

517
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:37,149
github you can see that some pretty

518
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:43,149
important functions are not implemented

519
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:47,219
at all I did spend more time to figure

520
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:50,678
out what is going on here then I can

521
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:53,200
tell you because I'm quite impressed how

522
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,989
much time I did spend on it but I

523
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,980
couldn't figure really out what I should

524
00:30:55,989 --> 00:31:04,149
do here so this is what I can provide to

525
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:07,269
you instead of the demo but luckily this

526
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:11,408
year I found another guy who was really

527
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:14,859
interested in recreating the Morris worm

528
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:18,220
so I have his contacts so probably we

529
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:22,629
can team up and start the Morris theorem

530
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:25,629
again I'm pretty sure that almost all of

531
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:28,689
you guys heard about the not Pecha runs

532
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:34,359
from there two years from two years ago

533
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:37,570
and I found it very fascinating that a

534
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:40,090
lot of the functionalities between the

535
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:44,470
Morris worm and the not patch of worm is

536
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:48,939
the same the only difference is that 14

537
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:52,690
years has passed between the two both

538
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,629
scans the network for new victims both

539
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:58,840
exploits memory corruption

540
00:31:54,629 --> 00:32:02,428
vulnerabilities to spread both exploits

541
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,869
password reuse vulnerabilities to spread

542
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,389
the Morris worm really broke the

543
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:10,209
internet caused panic not patch up

544
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:11,619
partially broke the internet the only

545
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:16,149
difference is that back in the day

546
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:18,158
internet was really small so but when it

547
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:20,500
comes to calculating the damage is not

548
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,880
better is probably

549
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,740
in a hive bigger amount of money for

550
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,130
both worm there is a vaccine available

551
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,810
to prevent infection when it comes to

552
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:36,700
the Morris worm it runs just fine

553
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:42,790
without admin privileges but the not

554
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:48,100
patent needed the mimikatz module this

555
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:51,010
is not written anywhere but it's really

556
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:54,419
interesting to see that when this Morris

557
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:58,780
worm was released there was basically

558
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:01,930
zero paper on the internet how you can

559
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:05,170
write buffer overflows zero

560
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:10,240
it took I'm not sure like five years

561
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:14,710
after the Morris worm when a loved one

562
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:19,620
published his paper about smashing the

563
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:23,890
stack but the father of Robert Morris

564
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:28,139
was working for the NSA at the time when

565
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:32,170
Robert Morris released his code

566
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:34,240
exploiting the finger T demon yr memory

567
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:37,870
corruption exploits and buffer overflows

568
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,440
so I believe that this is had a lot of a

569
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:45,399
coincidence but when it comes to NAS

570
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:49,930
batch of V we know that they used leaked

571
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,480
code from the NSA the only huge

572
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,730
difference between the two codes is that

573
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,820
the Rob Morris worm was coded by a

574
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:03,520
single University student and not pakya

575
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:05,649
was coded by a huge apt rat actor it

576
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:12,040
might be a university student but we

577
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:14,380
don't know that also on the right you

578
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,170
can see the not pakiya screen and on the

579
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,960
left a very very old ransomware called

580
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:22,930
it's run somewhere so again I find it

581
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,300
really fascinating that the North petal

582
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:28,870
developers were using the same design

583
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:32,980
choices what was used back in the old

584
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:34,199
days alright let's talk about gopher

585
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:39,719
how many of you guys we

586
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:43,078
the Gopher site our awesome awesome

587
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:47,399
probably if I have internet I can show

588
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:51,359
it to you how it looks like cool so

589
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:55,409
basically how you have to imagine a

590
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,149
gopher site is that you just have a text

591
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,470
file in the beginning you have

592
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:02,578
directories and you have files and

593
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:06,328
basically that's it you can go into

594
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:10,740
directories and read the files that's it

595
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:16,790
so this is what was popular before the

596
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:19,439
world wide web Windows 95

597
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,119
have more fun from his friendly

598
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,910
intuitive interface with speedy

599
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,950
performance Windows 95 is the best so in

600
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,470
the next couple of minutes I will talk

601
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:35,009
about hacking Windows 95 and how you can

602
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:37,709
do that you want to ask how in the hell

603
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:42,560
did I start to hack Windows 95

604
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:46,500
and there was a fun story around this I

605
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,619
was playing at a CTF event and turned

606
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,160
out that one of the machines we had to

607
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:57,119
hack was a Windows 95 machine and no one

608
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:01,649
was able to hack it in that during that

609
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:05,130
competition so I went home and I created

610
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:07,940
my lab environment and I tried to figure

611
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:11,400
out how you can hack it

612
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,910
my goal was that I have to use existing

613
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,170
tools for the hack because during a CTF

614
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:21,359
there is really during that kind of CTF

615
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,970
if you're playing there is not time to

616
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,180
create your own tools or find your own

617
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:29,759
exploits I have to achieve remote code

618
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:33,140
execution with my hack but there is no

619
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,569
user interaction on the windows 95 side

620
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:40,319
I wanted to set up everything as default

621
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:42,000
as possible but turns out that when you

622
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:44,250
install Windows 95 there is no

623
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,650
networking configured at all so it's

624
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,860
impossible to hack it so I had to

625
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,940
configure our network

626
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:55,720
and by default there is no port opened

627
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,810
on the windows 95 so I had to create a

628
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,230
service in order to open a port so I

629
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:06,570
just created a writable see share on the

630
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:11,680
windows 95 and there is this really fun

631
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:15,520
vulnerability which was exploited by a

632
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:19,569
network firm later and the way this

633
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,780
exploit works is that the windows 95

634
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:26,500
server checks the length of the password

635
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:28,360
based on what the client sends to it so

636
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,870
if you send that all right my password

637
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:34,030
is 0 has a zero length it will say oh I

638
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,799
checked your zero length password with

639
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,560
my store password and it matches on the

640
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,660
zero length so you are in but if you

641
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:46,150
send a length of 1 then you can

642
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,730
basically try to figure out the first

643
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:52,630
letter of the password very easily you

644
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:54,430
just have to try the escalators then you

645
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,650
can go onto the next one and next one

646
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,759
and you get this real Hollywood style

647
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:05,110
hack how you can get the password I

648
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:09,420
found this very old tool to basically do

649
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:12,430
this hack but it's not very modern and I

650
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,490
couldn't really use it on my operating

651
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:22,200
systems I'm using nowadays if you look

652
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:24,399
at the wireshark capture this is the

653
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,520
capture where you can see that it

654
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,360
already figured out that the password

655
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:35,800
starts with the pass then it checks the

656
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:38,710
W and it gets a different answer so now

657
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:45,390
it knows that the password starts with

658
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:51,810
post W then it starts the other letters

659
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:56,710
so here we can see this in action and

660
00:38:51,810 --> 00:39:00,230
because I was not satisfied with the GUI

661
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:04,400
tool I really meant editing Metasploit

662
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:08,810
and I will publish it after the

663
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:15,260
presentation so here we can see there is

664
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:17,960
a huge delay put into the script so by

665
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:21,440
default it can figure out the password

666
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:25,070
in like two seconds or even less but

667
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,680
that wouldn't be very nice to show you

668
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:30,410
during this demo so this is where you

669
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,950
can see that it tries to figure out the

670
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:38,690
password and it will see that okay

671
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:46,279
next data was Oh so I can go on and see

672
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:50,450
all the others yeah and it tracks all

673
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:55,580
the shares it can find so nothing really

674
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:57,439
exciting here and last but not least how

675
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:02,180

676

678
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:11,780
