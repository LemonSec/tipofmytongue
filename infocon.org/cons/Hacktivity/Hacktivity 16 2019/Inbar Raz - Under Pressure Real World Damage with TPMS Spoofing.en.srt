1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
hi everybody thank you for showing up

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,170
and thanks for the organizers for

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,090
letting me speak here this is my second

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,860
year if you know me you know I speak

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,030
barefoot it's kind of nice it's a

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,250
gimmick makes me feel more comfortable

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,240
you can take your shoes off as well if

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,880
you want just you know well I'm gonna

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,609
talk today about research that we did at

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,570
Argus it's a work of more than one

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:31,080
person and these are the people this is

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,050
la CL the CL is the radio guy he's

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,480
actually on his way to Brazil now to

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,599
give the same talk we had colliding

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,540
events she was in charge of signals

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,579
analysis there was a lot of decoding and

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,129
analysis and trying to understand what

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,530
we see in radio signals this is me in

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,968
the back in this which we will meet

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,789
later is an Ikea clothes hanger why we

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,949
will see so who's familiar with TPMS who

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:04,019
knows what TPMS is okay not many people

23
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,899
TPMS tire pressure measurement system or

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,990
monitoring system is a little device

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,850
that sits inside of the wheel it has a

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,580
little battery and basically it just

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,699
transmits the tire pressure to the

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,920
vehicle many reasons to do that flat

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,530
tire you want to know about it if you

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,900
have a bad pressure then it affects the

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,750
way the vehicle behaves or your fuel

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,420
consumption and in some vehicles you can

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,900
auto inflate provided that you know you

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:39,299
have a pressure problem and this thing

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:41,310
has okay alright so this has been

36
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,640
extensively researched we're not the

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,439
first people to look at that there have

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,869
been talks about this in a number of

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,939
conferences people were researching that

40
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,710
analyzing the signal the signal is not

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,048
encrypted this is the number one problem

42
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,869
with it and many people reached the same

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,969
conclusion that you can analyze it you

44
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,420
can decode it you can spoof it and

45
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,969
basically what everybody said was this

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,119
is harmless there's almost nothing you

47
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,739
can do with it you can maybe cause

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,120
someone to pull over if they're driving

49
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,970
on the highway and all of a sudden they

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,700
think they have a low

51
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,770
sure they will like maybe pull over

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,200
right that can be a beginning scenario

53
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,450
of maybe hijacking someone or robbing

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,940
them or just taking their car whatever

55
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,190
or as I mentioned before if you have an

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,740
automatically inflating tire then you

57
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,109
could cause extra inflation that will

58
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,260
also cause damage but the general

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:39,550
consensus says the potential for damage

60
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:43,989
is very small and we saw that and we

61
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,420
said hmm this is very it's a very strong

62
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,270
saying to say this is useless because

63
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,780
when you say it's useless it's it's not

64
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,730
dangerous

65
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,810
then people stopped caring about that

66
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,810
they stopped looking at that and we

67
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,930
thought what if we can prove that it is

68
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,530
not as unimportant as everyone thinks

69
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,140
right

70
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,140
and we got our inspiration from this

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,980
you

72
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,490
what if we could cause that sort of this

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,590
distraction to many people at the same

74
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,210
time I mean if it's just one driver and

75
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,698
like we said before you get this little

76
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,680
light and maybe they pull over it has no

77
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,949
significance well what if we could make

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,870
it happen on a bigger scale so we start

79
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,970
with one car you need to receive the

80
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,690
signal you need to be able to analyze

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,690
and parse it

82
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,759
it has different fields of information

83
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,919
different cars have different standards

84
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,259
then you have to modify it we want to

85
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,758
change the tire pressure value to

86
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,069
something that will cause the alert

87
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,159
right this little sound and a little

88
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,569
light bulb on the dashboard and then we

89
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,569
want to retransmit it this is the

90
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:09,210
scenario for one car now let's try to

91
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:12,419
scale it up these are the fields that

92
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:16,409
you usually have okay every single tire

93
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,508
has their own ID so in order to be able

94
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:21,210
to talk to a specific car you need to

95
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:23,310
know the specific tire ID that the car

96
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,659
knows otherwise it's not gonna work this

97
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,659
is why you have to listen first you

98
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:29,639
can't just transmit stuff so you get all

99
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,099
the information you need now if you try

100
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,289
to scale it up then obviously you need

101
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,900
to be able to capture multiple vehicles

102
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,639
right so you need to do highway traffic

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,948
capture and of course this is a little

104
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,550
pun because the cap the traffic is both

105
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,159
radio and vehicles but you need to be

106
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,340
able to do that and analyze and parse

107
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:52,830
all of it in real time and if you look

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,630
at the entire scenario the whole setup

109
00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:00,810
then you start by positioning multiple

110
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,150
receivers why because this TPMS signal

111
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,280
doesn't transmit all the time it can

112
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,849
transmit anything between once every 15

113
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,609
seconds and once every 60 seconds so if

114
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:14,009
I want to receive the TPMS of this guy I

115
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,599
don't know when it's gonna transmit if I

116
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,580
wait for him here and it just

117
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,169
transmitted 10 seconds ago it's only

118
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,210
going to transmit 50 seconds down the

119
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,818
road and I'm not gonna be there so we're

120
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,099
gonna spread a bunch of receivers and

121
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,500
which means that over this little piece

122
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,740
of road let's say 2 3 4 kilometers

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,560
I will definitely at one point catch his

124
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,140
car transmitting then you need to

125
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,890
collect them all and

126
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,890
and then extract the information you

127
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:47,539
need specifically tire ID and be able to

128
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,930
replace aggregate and sync why because

129
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,280
if you look at this little piece of road

130
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,310
every car transmitted at a different

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,320
point but when we transmit we want it to

132
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,100
happen to all the cars at the same time

133
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,380
all the cars that are in a certain area

134
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,720
so this is the challenge and let's look

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,460
at this who knows this bridge anybody

136
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,020
from Denmark or Sweden here hello gobby

137
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,229
this is the bridge between Denmark and

138
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,659
Sweden so let's look at that we take an

139
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,870
rtl-sdr this device is receiving only

140
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,910
but it costs about nine dollars you can

141
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,710
get it on eBay or anywhere else and we

142
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,820
position a bunch of them let's say eight

143
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,950
over this piece of road so any car

144
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,980
coming from here and driving towards the

145
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,599
tunnel at some point the TPMS will

146
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,760
transmit because it takes more than a

147
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,070
minute to cross through the bridge and

148
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,190
then I take another device this little

149
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,990
guy is called the yardstick one it is

150
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,600
made by someone who spoke here last year

151
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,730
and this device is also able to transmit

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,740
and very easily it has a Python

153
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,280
interface you just send it a Python

154
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,890
command with the parameters about $100

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,549
maybe 130 and then we transmit

156
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,430
everything here so right before the

157
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,340
vehicles enter the tunnel we transmit

158
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,560
the signal now imagine that you have 40

159
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,049
or 50 cars traveling at 100 kilometres

160
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,500
an hour and all of them get this little

161
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,940
one two maybe three of them will take

162
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,250
their eyes off the road and look at the

163
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,740
dashboard and when this happens at 100

164
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,210
kilometers an hour in a tunnel there

165
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,580
could be consequences now we're not

166
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,650
saying there will definitely be but this

167
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,770
thing only needs to succeed once in

168
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:35,120
order to cause real damage so status

169
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,919
report we're somewhere in the middle on

170
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,770
one hand we have a success on the other

171
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,140
one we have a lot of failure and this is

172
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,610
actually part of the talk many times

173
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,890
when you go to security conferences and

174
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,720
someone is standing on stage and telling

175
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,939
you what they did they give you the

176
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,890
solution they don't explain to you

177
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,070
they got to the solution what did they

178
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,560
try what worked what didn't work it's a

179
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,240
lot less teaching to get the textbook

180
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,099
answer but if someone tells you the

181
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,350
process that they took then you can

182
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,500
learn from that on how to do better

183
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,420
research in which directions to look how

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,220
to approach problems and we're going to

185
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,949
be or I I'm going to be sharing what we

186
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,470
did we chose to do that because we

187
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,060
wanted a learning experience as I

188
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,740
mentioned in the beginning this had been

189
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,420
researched before we could have just

190
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,400
taken all the work and continue from

191
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,650
there we didn't want to do that we

192
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,920
wanted to learn stuff that we hadn't

193
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,140
done before and that meant that we

194
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
reinvented the wheel right we went

195
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,770
through stuff that other people had

196
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,750
already gone through and posted the

197
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,140
results but we didn't know how they got

198
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,050
there

199
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,730
people just posted code and we didn't

200
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,589
know so we wanted to learn and of course

201
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,200
the meaning is that it took us a lot

202
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,420
longer than we had expected to the

203
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,090
extent that the first time that we

204
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,709
applied this talk to a conference we

205
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,030
applied with the abstract and then

206
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,490
started the research and we actually

207
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,709
didn't finish the research in time for

208
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,870
that conference so we showed up and said

209
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,940
well we wanted to talk about but we

210
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,920
failed and this is how we also got the

211
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,990
idea to insert that into the

212
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,540
presentation but now we're a little bit

213
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:14,330
better what have we learned during the

214
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:18,740
work it's not easy to find the signal

215
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:22,610
the TPMS signal is on two bandwidths 440

216
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,800
or 34 in Europe and 315 megahertz in the

217
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,800
US there are for public use there are

218
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,010
many many devices that transmit in this

219
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,469
range for example your car keys right

220
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,170
the remote keyless entry they transmit

221
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,460
in that frequency a lot of other devices

222
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,900
because you don't need to license

223
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,540
anything that works in that frequency

224
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,610
range so one of our problems when we

225
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,980
were listening to radio waves was to

226
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,950
determine which signal was in fact the

227
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,960
TPMS remember we started from scratch so

228
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,610
we didn't know what pattern to look for

229
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,670
we said okay we look for something that

230
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,550
is maybe cyclic or whatever so there was

231
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,530
a lot of signal and in the beginning we

232
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,589
didn't know what it was we were chasing

233
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,430
a lot of dead

234
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:08,009
and that's important we had a one

235
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,120
particular problem this is lazier and

236
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:15,620
this is my vehicle and this is the hack

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,850
RF and here is the yardstick one we had

238
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,129
such a hard time getting a good signal

239
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,959
so we said okay let's take the best

240
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,899
parameters we're gonna take the computer

241
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,529
and sit in front of the wheel what more

242
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,069
can you ask for

243
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:32,790
right the transmitter is one meter away

244
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:34,680
from the receiver not even okay and we

245
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,839
set this is the underground parking lot

246
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,008
okay it's not a nice air-conditioned

247
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,259
hole I hear we sat there for hours hours

248
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,089
and it didn't work sometimes we got a

249
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,100
signal sometimes we didn't get a signal

250
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,379
sometimes we got a signal but it wasn't

251
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,870
EPM s sometimes we got a signal that we

252
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,689
thought was TPMS but didn't have the

253
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,850
cyclic timing that we were expecting and

254
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:59,399
at some point after wasting many hours

255
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,470
said okay we got the point we accept our

256
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,879
failure we're going to take the shortcut

257
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,980
the shortcut is to take the wheel off

258
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,649
the car and then take the tire off the

259
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,629
rim and then look at the transmitter

260
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,959
itself because on these devices you have

261
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,670
the FCC ID code and the FCC ID website

262
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,500
will give you most of the information

263
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,559
that you need the frequency range and

264
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,939
the modulation used and this is a very

265
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,529
good source of information which we

266
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:30,509
didn't want to go to we wanted to figure

267
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:32,970
it out but we failed and then after

268
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,220
hours of sitting on the floor we

269
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,300
discovered that my car doesn't have that

270
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,300
TPMS transmitter

271
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:47,819
you mention our surprise so yeah that

272
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,470
was a little bit embarrassing

273
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,149
of course we immediately knew were gonna

274
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,550
talk about that that's why we took that

275
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:57,749
photo and then we found someone in the

276
00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:00,988
company that did have a TPMS and this is

277
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:03,449
the device and here we were finally

278
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:07,529
getting a signal this scenario actually

279
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:09,929
helped us because one of the ways to

280
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,029
cause the TPMS sensor to start

281
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:14,579
transmitting more than once a minute is

282
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:17,040
if it detects a significant change in

283
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,508
the pressure and imagine that when you

284
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,279
take the tire off and then you put it

285
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,709
back on and you have to inflate the tire

286
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,639
the sensor is like whoo something's

287
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:25,559
going on let's party

288
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,049
and then he starts transmitting so that

289
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,079
was the first time we got a clear signal

290
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:34,799
in many bursts and that was a very big

291
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,899
step for us right so we started you know

292
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,049
reading the documents and determining

293
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:43,529
the signal and what we actually needed

294
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:44,670
the whole time was to find it you see

295
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,170
this is what it looks like it's very

296
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,748
similar to the ones that I've shown you

297
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,059
before it was hard to tell but here you

298
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:53,009
can see a clear modulation if you have

299
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,139
an experience with radio you can see

300
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,119
this is a clear modulation of bits and

301
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,429
this is what we were looking for and

302
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,589
these were the parameters if you know

303
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:03,269
anything about radio these will mean

304
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:06,299
something to you they describe the

305
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:07,709
signal how it is modulated what are the

306
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,230
parameters their merit many parameters

307
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,489
for modulating a signal and you need to

308
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,509
know them all if you want to be able to

309
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,970
demodulate

310
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,459
the signal so this is the mystery and

311
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,009
once we had that things started to work

312
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,618
for us this is a new radio companion

313
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,749
it's an open-source package Rossi is an

314
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:26,549
expert on that and it took him a very

315
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:28,919
long time to build this very

316
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:31,199
sophisticated graph that was supposed to

317
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,299
do everything automatically but even

318
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,669
that didn't work at the first start and

319
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,439
he had to rewrite a lot of stuff so like

320
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:39,839
I said we reinvented the will it was a

321
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:42,719
lot of work of course now he's a much

322
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,029
better expert but at the end this is an

323
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,669
open-source package each and every one

324
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:50,939
of you can do exactly the same doesn't

325
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:53,930
cost anything and then came

326
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,910
the analysis okay we have plenty of bits

327
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,880
let's see what well what to do with them

328
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,790
here I just changed it to dashes and

329
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,950
dot's because in when you look at zeros

330
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,449
and one they're the same size it's

331
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,760
harder to notice but when you do this

332
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,520
this the symbols are not the same size

333
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:16,560
so this is actually easier on the eye

334
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:18,540
now who recognizes this this is the city

335
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,349
of Manchester

336
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,130
there is Manchester coding here and we

337
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,040
kind of forgot about that

338
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,480
so that also took us sometimes you can

339
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,939
have Manchester encoding in two

340
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,920
different ways so we were stepping on

341
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,380
all the land mines during the research

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,420
until we finally managed to get

343
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,640
everything right and that helped us

344
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,250
because Manchester encoding also lets

345
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,990
you know when the packet starts and what

346
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,000
it ends because as you can see there's

347
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,580
there are a lot of bits here and you

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,550
really need to know which part of it is

349
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:54,300
relevant

350
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:57,599
we tried even recording the signal and

351
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,209
replaying it and to see if we can

352
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,070
analyze it as you can see this is again

353
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,200
Razzies work you can see the clear

354
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,410
signal and you can see the bits being

355
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,530
decoded and that worked very well in the

356
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,770
lab right it's a recorded real-world

357
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:18,030
signal being transmitted to our receiver

358
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:19,260
sort of a lab bench I guess you can call

359
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,860
it and it worked

360
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,680
however when you go to the car and you

361
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,010
start driving with the same setup all of

362
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,370
a sudden it's not as good it was a lot

363
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:35,240
harder to get a signal Razi was driving

364
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,190
around the city and they didn't work

365
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,690
this is the clothes hanger which we

366
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,480
mentioned before the reason we needed

367
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:45,210
that is because we had a directional

368
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,940
antenna which is perfect for this sort

369
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,190
of radio signal it's designed for this

370
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,690
frequency it's designed to look straight

371
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,370
forward and not in a wide beam and we

372
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,050
the office that we work at at Argos it's

373
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,270
right over the road the road is

374
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,699
literally down the building so we said

375
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,630
okay let's put the antenna on the closed

376
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,890
hangar looking

377
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:11,039
and record some signals and as you can

378
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,140
see or as you might be able to detect we

379
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,439
are not at ground level we were actually

380
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,569
on this 36th floor and we discovered

381
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,209
that that was too much for the signal

382
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,730
and the only way to actually get a good

383
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,620
signal was to go sit by the highway so

384
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,589
this is me sitting next to the highway

385
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:31,070
in the middle of the tel-aviv summer

386
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:34,980
recording bits okay

387
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:39,570
very easy same device same setup I just

388
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:41,640
had to sit close to the road after that

389
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,039
we said okay let's try to do the whole

390
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,500
thing let's get a signal analyze it

391
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,960
extract the tire pressure change the

392
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,720
tire pressure and transmit again we

393
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,080
built elapsed a lab setup in the lab

394
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,520
setup everything works fine really you

395
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,710
can see the bits going out you can check

396
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,470
the modulation but again when you try it

397
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,630
in real life it doesn't work the

398
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,190
benefits of this lab setup was that it

399
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,500
saved us a lot of time instead of

400
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,659
sitting outside waiting for signals and

401
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,669
then trying our stuff we were able to

402
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:14,100
use a recorded signal what you can see

403
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:16,799
here is a device transmitting the

404
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,600
recorded signal directly into the

405
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,030
yardstick one instead of connecting an

406
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,500
antenna we connected the receiver and

407
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,899
the transmitter with a cable so that

408
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,720
helped a lot and here came another

409
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,940
problem it was time to try the

410
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,780
transmission and this is again the

411
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,830
parking lot

412
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,678
the close hangar and the antenna and we

413
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,530
just couldn't get it work it worth in

414
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,970
the lab we went down to the parking lot

415
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,750
with the same device the same equipment

416
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,610
it did not work and remember there's not

417
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,250
a lot of work here it's a bunch of

418
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,260
Python commands going to a device and

419
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,780
all the modulation all the radio stuff

420
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,390
is happening on the device it's not even

421
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,760
on the computer and we tried my computer

422
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,070
which is the MacBook Air and it just

423
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,250
didn't work and then we tried the seals

424
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,980
computer which is also a MacBook Air and

425
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,200
it then it did work and everything else

426
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,510
is the same it's the same script it's

427
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,570
the same device literally the same

428
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,370
yardstick 1 and this is voodoo we we

429
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,830
don't have an explanation for that you

430
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,050
any of you guys have an explanation we

431
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,970
would love to hear nothing else work

432
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,919
other than me dropping my computer and

433
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,900
using lousy else computer which is

434
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,100
almost the same computer in fact it's a

435
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:37,800
little older so we don't know

436
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:42,540
so eventually where do we stand it was

437
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:45,149
time to see it was like that when we got

438
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,030
here don't worry it was time to see how

439
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:51,330
this is working so remember our

440
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:55,530
objective is to transmit a spoofed

441
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:58,350
signal that will cause the light to go

442
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:02,460
on okay and this is what it looks like

443
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:04,590
this is Rosie's vehicle and this is me

444
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,330
and we tried to sync the videos so let's

445
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:12,990
see what we try to do the vehicle is

446
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:15,090
parked outside the frame here and we

447
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,120
wanted to see whether if the antenna

448
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,909
which is here transmit the signal while

449
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,879
the vehicle goes by we can spoof the

450
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,160
signal that was from close range but

451
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,170
remember we wanted to cause the same

452
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,990
effect on a large highway a large

453
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:34,440
highway would have four five six

454
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:37,230
depending on your country lanes each one

455
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,380
is maybe two and a half three meters so

456
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,350
you want to get a bigger distance so

457
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,520
what we were gonna do is after clearing

458
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:51,719
this range we're gonna go over there

459
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:54,629
this is the Lowe's floor of the parking

460
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,000
lot we it was important to us to do it

461
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,410
in a relatively sterile environment we

462
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,510
didn't want to affect everybody anybody

463
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,400
else we were doing some driving we

464
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:08,030
needed no one to be there so this was

465
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,030
the perfect solution let's try again

466
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:24,009
yeah it's not gonna work we're gonna

467
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:26,289
skip this one so where we got I will so

468
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:29,499
let let me spoil you the it works right

469
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:31,989
the car drives we spoofed the signal and

470
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:35,710
it works and actually we got it to work

471
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:39,220
up to 30 meters away with this little

472
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:42,909
antenna the directional antenna without

473
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:47,919
an amplifier so imagine this setup can

474
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:49,529
cause the same effect in roughly let's

475
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,419
say the size of this hole

476
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:55,840
okay so cars driving here and car drive

477
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:57,730
a car driving at the back this will work

478
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,350
on all of them provided that we got all

479
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:05,739
the information from before okay this is

480
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:09,279
challenging so what did we get the

481
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:12,730
ranges that we got were up to 30 meters

482
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:16,149
which covers a lot as I mentioned and

483
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,889
then we started working on the setup now

484
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:20,979
the way to do the setup remember I

485
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:23,080
mentioned we wanted to position multiple

486
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,759
receivers and connect them all to a

487
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,158
central station then we'll later

488
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,840
transmit the way to do that we wanted to

489
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,059
go as simple as possible we had already

490
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,399
spent too much time and effort on

491
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:36,940
reinventing the wheel so we went with

492
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:38,619
raspberry PI's the Raspberry Pi can

493
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,580
easily support an internet connection

494
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:44,769
and this really nice rtl-sdr the little

495
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:50,199
dongle that I mentioned before that only

496
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:53,559
receives and costs $8 so we built an

497
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,279
open VPN setup where the main station is

498
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:59,590
the server and then each of the other

499
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,539
receiving stations is a client and when

500
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,449
you use that with certificates then this

501
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,499
setup is completely scalable all you

502
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,840
have to do if you want to add another

503
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:10,269
receiving station is just clone the

504
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,279
Raspberry Pi and change the certificate

505
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,619
and now we can add another one and once

506
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:17,139
they all connect to the VPN server then

507
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:19,238
they're all in the same subnet they can

508
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:21,609
talk to each other and they can talk to

509
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:24,309
the main system the main system will be

510
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:25,960
receiving the information from all the

511
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,070
raspberry PI's doing all the

512
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,380
calculations

513
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:31,418
and this is where the hard part is and

514
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,490
to be honest we're not there yet

515
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:35,289
we chose to stop the research I'll talk

516
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,630
about that in a minute but then you have

517
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,610
to do all the synchronizing when we

518
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,519
receive the signal we have to add a

519
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,229
timestamp to it because remember the

520
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,570
signals will be received in at different

521
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:53,950
times but the transmission must happen

522
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:59,580
at one time for everybody so why did we

523
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,580
choose to stop the point all right yes

524
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:16,409
all right so we talked about the

525
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:22,829
distance and we talked about the backend

526
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:25,439
setup and now what's next there are

527
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:27,959
challenges here first of all there are

528
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:29,909
many different modulations this

529
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:32,489
particular TPMS that we were working on

530
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:35,069
as it turns out transmits in two

531
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:37,139
different modulations one of them is

532
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:39,239
when the vehicle is static and one of

533
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:41,458
them is when the vehicle is moving so

534
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:43,109
obviously we didn't care about the

535
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:45,179
modulation when the vehicle is static

536
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:46,799
but that just shows you the different

537
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,779
TPMS sensors from different

538
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,799
manufacturers will be using different

539
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,929
modulations with different parameters so

540
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,749
it is a matter of scaling up but this is

541
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,209
just research it will not be creating

542
00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:02,219
something that was not done before but

543
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:04,229
if you want to do this if you want to

544
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:06,629
create a setup that we mentioned then

545
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:08,879
yes we will need to go through more TPMS

546
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:10,889
sensors and there are many of them there

547
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:14,609
are many manufacturers and it's

548
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:17,129
challenging but this is what you have to

549
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:19,428
do in order to create the scenario and

550
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:22,918
the last thing is that synchronization

551
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:25,769
it's not easy we would have had to play

552
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:29,149
with that but we chose to stop why

553
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:32,099
because our objective was not to

554
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:34,228
actually carry out this attack this

555
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:39,299
could be dangerous we wanted to show

556
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:42,839
that it can be done so once we did it

557
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:45,569
for one vehicle then scaling it up is

558
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:50,039
not the big challenge and there was an

559
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:52,379
agenda here let's talk about mitigation

560
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,849
if I'm showing a problem then it's my

561
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:56,759
responsibility to offer a solution

562
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:59,968
otherwise I'm just giving bad people

563
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,889
ideas of course the trivial mitigation

564
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:04,859
that you can expect is someone to tell

565
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:08,579
you let's encrypt the transmission right

566
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:12,629
but here's a problem this little device

567
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:15,418
it's really small and it's using a coin

568
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:18,019
coin cell battery it doesn't have all

569
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:22,109
the computing power needed to execute

570
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,840
encryption right also what happens if

571
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:26,050
you

572
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,449
change the tire so you have four and

573
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,790
maybe a spare one but what happens if

574
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,680
you damage the rim so you get a new one

575
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,180
or and then what happens who is

576
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,510
synchronizing so this creates more

577
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:40,420
problems than it actually solves the

578
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,940
second option is to switch the operating

579
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:47,560
mode from listening to the wheel to

580
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,630
polling if the vehicle asks the wheel

581
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,850
what is your pressure instead of waiting

582
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,250
for the wheel to report then in order

583
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:57,129
for me to be able to spoof that signal I

584
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,980
would have to listen wait for that

585
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:02,800
question and then respond either quicker

586
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,870
or stronger than the wheel so this will

587
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,270
make this attack scenario a lot more

588
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:10,179
difficult not undoable but a lot more

589
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,780
difficult but this mitigation also has

590
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,220
its problems how how often do you do

591
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,440
that you can't do that

592
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,120
all the time because this device goes to

593
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,160
sleep when it's not transmitting if you

594
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,159
ask it every ten seconds then you're

595
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,740
gonna you know shorten the battery life

596
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,650
if you ask it every minute what happens

597
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,500
if there was a problem in between you

598
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,720
know two questions I asked it here and

599
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,120
then ten seconds later I have a flat

600
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,800
tire is it going to take me fifty

601
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,429
seconds to find out so this is not a

602
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,680
good idea

603
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:43,570
and the last mitigation is something

604
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,630
that can actually already be done and

605
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:50,050
relatively easy the vehicle has many

606
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:53,020
different sensors already inside it one

607
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,870
of them is measuring the rotation speed

608
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,530
of the wheel now when you take a wheel

609
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,330
and you take the air out of it the speed

610
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,360
at which the wheel is revolving will

611
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:07,240
change and vehicles know that okay this

612
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,760
is for example how the ABS works when

613
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,100
you brake and the ABS senses that the

614
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,780
wheels are not turning at the same speed

615
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,939
then it knows that you're starting to

616
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,570
skid and then all sorts of things start

617
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,850
happening so anti-skid and also abs so

618
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:25,389
the vehicle already knows that so

619
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:27,340
imagine if you get a low pressure signal

620
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,230
and then you correlate it with the

621
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,350
rotational speed and you see that the

622
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,000
speed hasn't changed then you know that

623
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,730
it is not

624
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,710
it's it's a false signal and this is

625
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,549
easy you can do this already with

626
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:46,629
existing vehicles no need for additional

627
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:48,340
hardware but of course the most

628
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:51,789
important mitigation is not even in the

629
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,129
vehicle it's as always in security it's

630
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:56,110
about the users and basically you have

631
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:58,779
to keep your eyes on the road and this

632
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,309
applies to all of us being distracted

633
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,870
while driving is one of the most

634
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,269
dangerous things that can happen and

635
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,459
this one actually started this whole

636
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:09,490
research the idea that we can cause

637
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:14,980
distraction to many drivers at the same

638
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:18,850
time now an important message it's

639
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:22,320
doable yes it's difficult it requires a

640
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:25,840
number of conditions maybe you need a

641
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,870
really busy highway with many lanes and

642
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,850
many may I don't know maybe a tunnel but

643
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,120
it's doable and as I mentioned before in

644
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,019
the beginning it only takes once the way

645
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,879
the world works

646
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:38,860
is that if something really bad happens

647
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:41,949
and then someone comes in claims

648
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,840
responsibility and says unless you pay

649
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,870
me 1 million dollars this will start

650
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,939
happening every other day there is

651
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,219
nothing people will do except pay

652
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:56,080
because there's nothing you can do

653
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:59,289
people get scared so it is a threat that

654
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:03,908
needs to be considered another thing

655
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:05,950
which is actually our agenda yes

656
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:08,919
everybody who looked at it said that it

657
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,419
was not dangerous but there's a saying

658
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,389
in English where there's a will there's

659
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,690
a way and in our case when we as hackers

660
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:19,570
as white hats and of course when black

661
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:23,139
hats do that when there's malice there's

662
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:25,149
a way a bad guy will always find a way

663
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:28,178
to make your system do something it

664
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:30,610
wasn't supposed to do and I think that

665
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:32,799
any of you who do actual security

666
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,229
research you know that most of the

667
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,168
problems that we find are because the

668
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:40,259
people who created the product were not

669
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:42,850
taking something into consideration

670
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,379
because people want to be good people

671
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,169
they want to think everybody else is

672
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:49,679
good so if the value

673
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:53,890
use of a variable or between 1 and 100

674
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,390
why would anyone put 200 or 1000 why

675
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,010
would they do that that's the sort of

676
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,680
question you get from people so we

677
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,940
wanted to show that even when everybody

678
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,340
looks at something and it looks harmless

679
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,490
if you really want to cause damage with

680
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:10,330
it there might be a solution or is

681
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:12,850
somebody else framed it if there is a

682
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:15,720
way to do anything there will be malice

683
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,850
because this is how the world works and

684
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,600
this is the most important thing scale

685
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:24,939
matters what I personally do at Argos is

686
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,490
threat analysis and risk assessment this

687
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,670
is hacking but on the earlier stages at

688
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,980
the design stages and this is the best

689
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,050
opportunity to find all the problems and

690
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,760
all the risk scenarios so they can later

691
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,040
decide what to deal with what to

692
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,950
mitigate and what not to mitigate and

693
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,600
this material case shows you that if I

694
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,930
do a threat analysis and risk assessment

695
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,560
on a vehicle and I look at the TPMS yes

696
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:53,380
the result will be this is a viable risk

697
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,620
scenario spoofing the TPMS signal but

698
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,390
the risk score will be very low because

699
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,860
the worst you can do to a single vehicle

700
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:05,320
if you spoofed the TPMS signal is maybe

701
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:08,350
make the driver pull over or as we're

702
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,450
starting to understand distracting the

703
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,610
driver can also have security

704
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,100
implications but that's it it's one

705
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:18,399
vehicle but if I do the same thing at

706
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,500
scale if the same scenario happens too

707
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,230
many vehicles at the same time at the

708
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,300
same place then the risk score is no

709
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,840
longer low it is actually very high

710
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,909
because in my best-case scenario as an

711
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,730
attacker I can actually cause a car

712
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:36,790
crash at 100 kilometres an hour inside

713
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,980
the tunnel this could be very bad so

714
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,290
scale matters things that look harmless

715
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,310
on a small scale could look very

716
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:47,190
differently when you go up the scale

717
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:50,919
another thing which is not said enough

718
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:53,140
failure is part of the work process for

719
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,000
me it's easy to say I'm Israeli in our

720
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,430
culture we fail all the time

721
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,430
we embrace failure we talk about failure

722
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,970
we share our failure of course we like

723
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,530
blaming

724
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,170
for their failure it's more fun

725
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:08,410
everybody does that but you cannot

726
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:10,210
succeed without failing and in fact the

727
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,330
most dangerous people are the people who

728
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,040
always succeed and never failed because

729
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,929
everything has always worked for them

730
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,629
and the first time that they're going to

731
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,120
you know encounter something really

732
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,640
really bad they will be unable to deal

733
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,040
with that like look at the computer that

734
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,560
thing was giving me trouble all the time

735
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,510
and I don't care because everything has

736
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,179
already happened to me I'm standing here

737
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,910
on stage being recorded and my computer

738
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,540
hangs okay so what happened to me before

739
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:44,580
and I survive to tell right in other

740
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:47,260
cultures failure is not accepted as such

741
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,090
now I'm not trying to change the culture

742
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,370
of other people but I am trying to

743
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,379
change the culture of the security

744
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,330
industry they're researchers people

745
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,910
think that if they share their failure

746
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,770
it's a bad sign which means that they're

747
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,690
going to lose their job people are not

748
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,210
going to think highly of them

749
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,810
professionally but in fact sharing your

750
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,940
failure helps other people and learning

751
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:13,960
from other people's failure teaches you

752
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,380
better and in fact in hack Lu two years

753
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,570
ago

754
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,760
Angelle Bertini which is an amazing

755
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,640
researcher the guy does things that

756
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,490
other people dream about he was giving a

757
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,879
complete talk about failures in InfoSec

758
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:30,669
and about impostor syndrome because

759
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,460
everybody has that everybody who's ever

760
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:35,830
been on a stage people that maybe you

761
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,290
and I look at them and say wow he's the

762
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,940
best in his field everybody makes

763
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:43,659
mistakes everybody fails

764
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:46,450
everybody has impostor syndrome so it's

765
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:48,580
okay it's part of our culture and we

766
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:51,009
need to accept that and this will make

767
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,929
us and our fellow researchers better at

768
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,920
what we do thank you

769
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:59,569
questions

770
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:01,920
[Applause]

771
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:05,700
is that the same question from last time

772
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,480
okay Gabi what do we have a microphone

773
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:21,660
further questions or is it gonna shout

774
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:25,890
we have a microphone all right so you

775
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:28,560
said that scaling it up is hard but how

776
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,710
do the manufacturers do it because when

777
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,580
I go to a service to replace the wheel

778
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,380
they what do they do they pull the TPMS

779
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,020
module out and install it in the new

780
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:43,350
wheel is it compatible with the new

781
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,570
wheel does every wheel that you buy have

782
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,490
a TPMS module inside like a brand new

783
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:51,230
one how'd they manage like all of the

784
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:55,020
different encodings and packets okay and

785
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,880
your car either has TPMS in its wheels

786
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,100
or it doesn't when you go to a shop

787
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,130
assuming it's a licensed shop and not

788
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,440
some somebody's backyard then they have

789
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,540
diagnostic equipment which they connect

790
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,210
to the vehicle through the obd2

791
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,029
connector they talk to the receiver ECU

792
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:14,340
and they can sync it with new receivers

793
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,260
and this is their responsibility when

794
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,990
you buy a new car ninh has four or five

795
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,900
tires they're all already synced it is

796
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,910
almost the same with the key some

797
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,010
sometimes we you when I was playing

798
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,560
around with SDR and I was doing replay

799
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,300
attacks on the key then I got the system

800
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,220
out of sync and my key stopped working

801
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,260
so I went to the shop and they just

802
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,240
connected to the port told the car

803
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,940
forget all the keys you know here are

804
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,350
two new keys and that's how it works but

805
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,020
this is done with that special

806
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:46,710
diagnostic equipment that most people

807
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,480
don't don't have or can't make and the

808
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,300
car shop they know how to do that

809
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,040
other questions also if you have any

810
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,350
questions I'll be around here today and

811
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,420
tomorrow feel free and remember failing

812
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:02,430
is an option no problem thank you okay

813
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,820
invar thank you very very much

814
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,819
[Applause]
