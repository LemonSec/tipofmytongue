8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,390
security politics so let's jump straight

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,869
to it according to China now we are

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,180
talking about an every milestone of the

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,600
history a new technology emerged our

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,570
society transformed as well now it is a

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,570
government in now People's Republic of

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,300
China with a brand new technology called

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,379
Social Credit System it's in famous in

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,190
the Western media right now they are

17
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:54,690
watching it in a negative matter and

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,989
with my presentation I would like to

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,000
enlighted as a governmental package and

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,328
I would like to introduce the Chinese

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,420
perspective as well as the best name

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,659
media's perspective because both have

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,150
right conclusions towards it so first I

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,409
would like to align the administrative

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,100
background and some of the social

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,509
behavior for the Chinese social system

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,880
now it is most common behavior and I

28
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,680
will talk about secondly a little bit of

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,579
vital structure and an information

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,530
technology this system using and then we

31
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,740
are jump straight to in the social

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,520
background of the system those behaviors

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,250
what are terrorists scored in the system

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,439
and some of the security issues which is

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,700
criticized by the Western media and now

36
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,798
my conclusion and so first of all I've

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,170
mentioned this is a public

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,790
administration reform package here we

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,880
have to stuff a little bit because

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,210
China's government already introduced

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:05,219
lower reforms which control internet

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,060
like like anonymity so in China you have

43
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,569
to use your real name when creating

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,840
profile for yourself and

45
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,879
back to 2014 when the social credit

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,760
systems inflammation in Tallinn tation

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,828
plan was introduced and up to 2020 there

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,500
will implemented national wide

49
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,280
integrated system right now there are

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,019
two different systems while working

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,180
there are main companies which has their

52
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,629
own credit course and there are

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,060
administrative social credit system so

54
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:44,209
there are a few different system right

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,030
now operating and by 2020 there will be

56
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,859
come together in a national vide system

57
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,099
with joint punishment system and joint

58
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:57,980
revolt as well so these are the four

59
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:00,078
main areas Chinese government would like

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,899
to reform its society with the help of

61
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:05,780
social credit system first of all it is

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,419
a construction and sincerity and

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,620
government affairs commercial sincerity

64
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:14,269
social sincerity in judicial credibility

65
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,299
if you want to read more about the

66
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:20,629
implementation plan I would recommend

67
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:24,260
you mr. rojack creamers website

68
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:28,970
he has translated all the Chinese texts

69
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,340
into English so right now the National

70
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,829
Development and Reform Committee as

71
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:40,159
making a centralized day to do an

72
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:43,159
infrastructure they are implying ai ai

73
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,649
cameras which has a first year

74
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:50,690
recognition program itself which we see

75
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:53,329
in the top picture and right now both

76
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:58,129
companies and citizens are scored by the

77
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:59,599
government and in the 2015 national

78
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,298
credit rating platforms being

79
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,569
established by we can search for both

80
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:10,099
companies and citizens is only available

81
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:12,198
for governmental bodies so the most

82
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:16,070
prevalent aspect is a data-driven

83
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:19,940
society in China and they are building

84
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,620
data aggregation from from construction

85
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,790
data because Chinese people are mostly

86
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,370
pay

87
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,520
by QR codes and this is a really common

88
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:34,510
that they use their faces to pay because

89
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,340
we know that Facebook is also introduced

90
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,880
that new program for the facial

91
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,479
recognition to login your profile so

92
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:47,950
they are also using it with paying and

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:51,000
even for example going to metro lines so

94
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:54,719
these are the main companies there are

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,910
eight hour maybe nine of them they're

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,180
cooperating with the government but I

97
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:04,870
highlighted this remain companies which

98
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,240
has a code name by be eighty first is

99
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,160
Baidu at the top it's a Google like

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,710
structure and they have searching port

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,320
our forum Maps News advantage and

102
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,109
platform and other services like cloud

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,740
computing web analytics virus defender

104
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,960
and also has an encyclopedia then we are

105
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,500
talking about which hat which is one of

106
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,739
the application of the famous Tencent it

107
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,320
is chatting up but also has a support

108
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,190
for voice record for using video as well

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,450
and the last one is Alibaba Group which

110
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,190
is like Amazon we know and they have cm

111
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,250
credit which has its own credit score

112
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:49,360
this is one of the famous system credit

113
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:53,100
score and they are making this own

114
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,990
social serum credit score by their

115
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,620
banking and financial services data for

116
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,560
each seasons here it looks like the

117
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,280
system credit score you could call at

118
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,890
maximum mercy 150 points and it collects

119
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,820
in different groups your data and with

120
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:16,450
scoring like from A to D and this way

121
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,520
you can operate and make self control to

122
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,940
get better scores which is very

123
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,159
interesting that system credit is also

124
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,640
integrated with the application by half

125
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,920
it's a dating application and when you

126
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,870
have searching for partner you also see

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,570
that how is their banking habits because

128
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,540
they analyte this core into this dating

129
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,260
application so I think and this is my

130
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,590
personal opinion this is where Social

131
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:54,810
Credit affects most their lives because

132
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:58,919
it can affect your partner options this

133
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:03,000
is made by me and we are I was

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,250
collecting four different steps to

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,060
establish social credit system firstly

136
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,580
monitoring

137
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,860
here comes in face the CCTV cameras

138
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,680
which is a high and AI and facial

139
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,610
recognition in it they are by monitoring

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,040
the Chinese government also as financial

141
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,670
data and Concepcion which is monitoring

142
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:30,510
and they are using real name so every

143
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,670
citizen has its own data package as well

144
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,400
as they are collecting biometric

145
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,800
information as a previous dimension this

146
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,960
is a facial recognition information but

147
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,360
also when entered China both of you are

148
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,830
the champ English has fingerprints so

149
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,530
they are so collecting it and they

150
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,200
integrated in ID cards which now has a

151
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,859
reform with the identification number

152
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,969
and with all the data like healthcare

153
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:04,110
and Bank films are integrated in one

154
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:07,170
pack and they are protected this data to

155
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,330
now generating databases and making

156
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:13,260
profiles for every citizen and even

157
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,870
every company now these data are shared

158
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,320
in provincial level and the provincial

159
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:23,760
levels with made cities and beta-version

160
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:27,060
cities of this system are making their

161
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,990
own scoring points their own scoring

162
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:34,350
aspect which is reflect the need of this

163
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,450
closed society of every province and now

164
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,420
they integrated the private sectors

165
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,480
credit information now we are talking

166
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,540
about basically a big data now they are

167
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,500
using big data analytics to align the

168
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,209
different

169
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:55,260
datas and and try to call acted they are

170
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:58,260
using flags like Badescu tanuki and if

171
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,680
this program and that's some bad

172
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,860
behavior and make turns that could be

173
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,339
dangerous like about your conception

174
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,100
make it could make IOD device because

175
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,830
you are buying dangerous things they are

176
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,280
flagging it and making an announcement

177
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:20,040
for example the police or you can flag

178
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,970
they can flag you in the blacklist and

179
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,250
also in the red list so the red list the

180
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,640
red this is a good list here comes the

181
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:33,750
citizens who are a model the also the

182
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,370
red lists are publicized because the

183
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,660
Earth's quorum has a model and there are

184
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,400
some of the rivers and for example such

185
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,110
activity as donating blood for into

186
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:48,420
Social Work others is room for the

187
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,180
implementation plans baggage like giving

188
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,130
a social trust it's giving bad loss

189
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,209
device it's on there or donating money

190
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,340
also Chinese big problem with the

191
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:03,000
ecosystem conscious behavior so it

192
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:06,000
conscious life is one of the main reason

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,700
why anyone can get plus scores like

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,350
green companies if you are new doing

195
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,950
technology for your companies you are

196
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:18,150
get faster loans and here comes also the

197
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:20,160
commercial services I see that more than

198
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:24,000
50 points they are scoring or repayment

199
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,770
history and if you are behaving good for

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,750
example in Shanghai it's called the

201
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,569
honest Shanghai program you have free

202
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,780
access to the Shanghai national library

203
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:38,040
and you can create deposit when you're

204
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:41,819
renting and also you have access to

205
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,280
luxury hotels and when is the the best

206
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:50,310
you can use VIP checking in Beijing

207
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:52,650
Airport and have have to wait less for

208
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,719
gaining visor like Canada or even

209
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:59,108
Schengen so if you want to go to you

210
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,029
your better quality of points

211
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:04,009
and the blacklist blacklist is a rap is

212
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,919
the bad one

213
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:08,839
they are also operating with public

214
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:12,468
shaming as we see in the picture

215
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,199
dispersion is jaywalking and in China if

216
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:17,599
you are jaywalking these tables are

217
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,608
publicized your name how many times you

218
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:22,279
did that tree walking and what did you

219
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:26,479
do it's like an announcement we can

220
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,669
think about that if we are losing

221
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:32,959
control over them says it's for our own

222
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:34,999
security and all mistake to make a

223
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,899
notice what we are doing because that

224
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:41,269
would be a huge catastrophe if you don't

225
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,999
take care of yourself so traffic when I

226
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,489
transitioned and for example in Beijing

227
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:50,409
if you are smoking on trains which is

228
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:55,959
also forbidden you can get your score

229
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:59,689
reduced for example in Jiangsu and

230
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,939
somebody didn't see their parents didn't

231
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:05,299
make health care which is code in the

232
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:07,218
last topic and it's household YouTube so

233
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:10,728
if you didn't take care of your elderly

234
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:15,259
your children you also get minus points

235
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:18,409
and if there is a family where violent

236
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:20,659
Asians come on it's also minus point as

237
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:23,779
well as when if the most interesting

238
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:27,199
part that false accusation and sender is

239
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:30,499
minus 100 points it's double of their

240
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:33,738
household virtue and the double of the

241
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:37,939
social order why you are harassing the

242
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:41,689
government governing political party so

243
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:46,339
why is this so important because every

244
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:51,049
citizen can score their companies if

245
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:56,839
they are finding some of the skipping

246
00:12:51,049 --> 00:13:01,429
judicial decide man's or something as

247
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:03,829
they can make an announcement with we

248
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,529
denote that if we are false accusations

249
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:09,859
they will get minus points so it's also

250
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:13,100
be building public trust towards this

251
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:17,320
the companies and the citizens the the

252
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:20,350
Mineral Point is like civil litigation

253
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,600
administrative punishment is also those

254
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:27,380
general governing parts which always we

255
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,440
get like bans and fines also when

256
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,000
analyzing conceptions you can also get

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,580
your points reduced if you are buying

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,030
too much alcohol or video games because

259
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:44,630
they get the adduction so this is all

260
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:46,310
also a protection from the raising also

261
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,960
what I found interesting with the

262
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,520
quitting firm versus without

263
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,680
announcement is also reducing points and

264
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,620
now let's talk about the efficiency

265
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,250
issues so we are known to change

266
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,400
society's altogether 1.4 billion person

267
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,460
but around there are just 800 million

268
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,290
Internet users so the world

269
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,800
infrastructure didn't cover the war

270
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,800
society also they could use VPN service

271
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,589
but it is forbidden by the laws of the

272
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,979
government so we didn't recommend it

273
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,780
also there are huge risk with hacker

274
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:30,320
ATA's because these systems are

275
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:32,949
integrated in one big data and every

276
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,070
citizens and what if a hacker just

277
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,350
attack all the other polish officials

278
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,480
what happens when the police officers

279
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,320
didn't get tickets from the Metro from

280
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,990
everything else and what if it's

281
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,160
blacklisted all the social services

282
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:55,400
workers it is a big risk but they would

283
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,829
also working on how to protect the

284
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,300
system but if the incorrect data

285
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:04,810
aggregation if I didn't do anything but

286
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:10,819
the machine is scoring me down because

287
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:14,239
there are false data and we can say that

288
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,280
what about ours and machine learning one

289
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,360
of the main points that are criticized

290
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:22,769
by Western media is that the minorities

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,709
are high

292
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:29,060
in police departments for example the we

293
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:32,310
were minority missing GM autonomous

294
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:36,199
territory Shinji and is important

295
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:40,550
because the one belt one road project is

296
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:44,160
one of the external point that China can

297
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:47,399
make their commerce towards Europe and

298
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,860
every other country so Shinji on should

299
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:56,160
be stable and that's why Western media

300
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:58,500
find out that the Sun Sun machine

301
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,300
learning are too strict towards these

302
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,550
minorities but it also had its positive

303
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,859
effects these are just the Magnavox

304
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,589
issues let me show you a little video

305
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,699
about the Chinese police using this

306
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:18,089
system the video is about gang it's a

307
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:22,949
city of 10 million people we would see

308
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:25,019
that the BBC's reporter who give one

309
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:28,170
single photo of himself to the Chinese

310
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:31,079
police he then close the door walk out

311
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,649
and let's see how much time does it take

312
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,540
to get him but where his photos by the

313
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:40,529
CCTV cameras a eye and face recognition

314
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:44,879
problems altogether it was 7 minutes to

315
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:48,319
get him so that's why Chinese police

316
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:51,149
could have be the most efficient Police

317
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:56,569
Department in the world with this data

318
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:59,309
in the picture we see an AI glass which

319
00:16:56,569 --> 00:17:01,589
which other glasses has facial

320
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:07,289
recognition and the lady could see in

321
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:10,980
this mobile found their data about if

322
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:15,750
somebody sees unusual behavior you can

323
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:18,959
check this with that sunglasses I heard

324
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:24,750
that they already called drug dealers

325
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:29,880
with this so now we skip about how

326
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:32,940
society reacted this is this analytics

327
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,020
is made by John Iacocca she's

328
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:43,320
our own Chinese politics and she found

329
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:48,180
out that for example in the middle age

330
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,639
and and older each person were more

331
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,550
positive on the data and what is also

332
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
interesting that if this Chinese people

333
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,560
has no confidence at all in the

334
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,980
government are providing the system as

335
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,620
good why is it because maybe the system

336
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,810
because it is public I see why I get bad

337
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:11,639
score why I get good score I know what

338
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:15,780
is it and how could I form my points it

339
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,740
could be better it could make all the

340
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:22,320
commerce vital or the market whiter so

341
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:27,180
as well as their Chinese using this

342
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:31,290
system to build more sensor society how

343
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:34,710
is it makes in political way I call it

344
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:37,379
immoral governance which is about the

345
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,210
words and punishment system so if

346
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,560
Chinese government comes to my heart

347
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:46,490
okay sounds good but okay so this

348
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:50,129
political system and its morals are

349
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:53,760
those what I can use in my personal life

350
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:56,250
I get more rewards I get my company work

351
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,980
and with this we can build a sense of

352
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,170
society and could work in society as

353
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,870
well as they are manipulating and

354
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,080
conditioning society with the personal

355
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,090
behavior with the morals and also the

356
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,310
market supply and conception habits

357
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,699
because if I get better points when I

358
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:18,200
buy national products I will do that

359
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,360
because it is good for me so this is the

360
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,130
the most interesting part of this system

361
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:30,479
and and this is where it got all the

362
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,580
society and when we are talking about

363
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,280
this animals data they are collect it

364
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,250
also can use to developing technology

365
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,950
like AI big data analytics and soon

366
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,650
China with the system implementing could

367
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,080
be a global leader in commerce and IT

368
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,610
technology providing

369
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:52,668
China would get a lot so we can see that

370
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:57,168
when that was I was choosing this

371
00:19:52,669 --> 00:20:01,090
Tiananmen picture because when Chinese

372
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:06,769
people were wanting more political

373
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:11,570
rights the government was decreasing

374
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:15,679
their action and nothing happened but in

375
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:21,580
exchange they get economic income and

376
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:25,730
and their social social options are

377
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:28,070
increased so this is like a status quo

378
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,220
so if we get our social level increase

379
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,590
we won't have political power and if we

380
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:38,720
are governing by morals that is all the

381
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,668
same so in conclusion all this relies in

382
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,230
accessibility if you are cooperating

383
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,090
with the government you will get

384
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,379
everything that you want

385
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:51,408
but also it could be used to reduce

386
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:53,980
those voices who are criticizing this

387
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:57,649
huge difference between criticizing and

388
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,239
bleeding down the society and also

389
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:01,279
contains the opportunity for self

390
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:04,399
correction so it also depends on the

391
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,289
behavior of the person who are using

392
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:09,199
this system it's a new type of

393
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:11,499
governance and more efficient and

394
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,669
executive body also have real-time

395
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:17,330
implementation with the AI and face

396
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:21,379
recognition system so yet it could be do

397
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:23,840
I use technology also which is in

398
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:25,850
question and I would like to talk about

399
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,999
we didn't know how they integrate social

400
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,730
media what about children from which age

401
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:34,639
we I can use this system and when I not

402
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,359
use I will be squirted by my parents

403
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:41,330
core so it also has a lot of question

404
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:43,039
still inside but I cross my fingers for

405
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,809
the Chinese government to Chinese people

406
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,340
to implement it right and use it right

407
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:51,918
because they can win a lot with it so

408
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,918
thank you for your attention and if you

409
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,060
have question please write me by our

410
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,220
email

411
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,870
and I would like to ask your questions

412
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,030
