1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,929
good morning and thank you for being

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,490
here today and I would really like to

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,259
say a huge thank you to the conference

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,690
organizers for having me here because

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,330
this is an opportunity I have not had

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,730
prior to be able to come to Budapest and

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,220
it is wow you guys have an absolutely

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,570
beautiful city it was amazing driving in

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,140
from the airport last night I was like

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,539
wow this is absolutely stunning so it is

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,859
really amazing in that regard to be able

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,619
to travel the world and see sort of

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,480
things like this my talk today called

14
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,090
sharks patrol these waters and the whole

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,980
idea here is talking about sharks in a

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,489
way that we don't historically do with

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,769
and I will in that with hackers because

18
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,440
typically people in the past would say

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,629
that sharks were threat these were the

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,099
things you had to worry about but nobody

21
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,030
ever seems to be concerned about the

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,370
ocean around them so Who am I before I

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,930
get too far down the road you can find

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,250
me on Twitter I've been told that I

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,739
should put that at the beginning of

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,210
every talk because I always put it at

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,718
the end and nobody ever seems to catch

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,820
that so I have been doing security in

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,270
one form of another now for the better

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,679
part of 25 plus years I even started

31
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,420
into these sort of things way before

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,670
that and along the way I have learned

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,900
all sorts of lessons and one of the

34
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,490
things that I like to say pretty much in

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,009
every talk I've ever been in is

36
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,649
something that one of my mentors told me

37
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,290
early on in my career write everything

38
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,180
down so as I've gone through through my

39
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,520
career all the mistakes I've made all

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,610
the errors the missteps I have written

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,640
them down and the reason for this is

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,350
because you learn from these mistakes

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,570
you learn from these and you're able to

44
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,860
take these messages forward and share

45
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,829
them with others in the hopes that they

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,210
don't make the same mistakes as well so

47
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,829
along the lines I've done everything

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,589
from being a firewall admin to being a

49
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,970
CSO for a power company and I have lots

50
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,969
of scar tissue to show for it so I

51
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,369
apologise for my accent I am Canadian

52
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,719
but don't hold that against me and I

53
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,729
find this necessary these days to

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,070
actually say that because far too often

55
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,649
people say oh you're an American to the

56
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,419
point where I was actually at a hotel in

57
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,430
New Delhi but a couple years ago and

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,349
this well-dressed woman walked up to me

59
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,900
in the lobby and said excuse me

60
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:20,909
are you an American I said no actually

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,829
I'm from Canada she said oh good I was a

62
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,569
little bit disturbing so much so that I

63
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:26,849
actually had a maple leaf worked into my

64
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,439
tattoo here because I figured the patch

65
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,179
on the backpack was far too much of an

66
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,069
American thing nothing against the

67
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,129
Americans just you know current state of

68
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,560
affairs being what they are so along the

69
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,939
lines I have worked in all sorts of

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,319
organizations and this is just a

71
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,519
sampling of the places that I've either

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,589
worked for with or on projects and it

73
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,389
has been really a great experience in a

74
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,430
lot of cases currently right now I'm

75
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,680
part of the duo security team at Cisco

76
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,659
Systems and I get to travel the world

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,400
having conversations about security and

78
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,810
not having to worry about people's red

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,180
staplers not having to worry about

80
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,919
people you know arguing over who stole

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,219
whose lunch out of the refrigerator it's

82
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,829
kind of nice I don't miss managing large

83
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,790
teams I have to be honest because there

84
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,189
were times at some of those

85
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,780
organizations where your entire soul

86
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,209
would be ripped from your body and

87
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,159
thrown out a window and that's one of

88
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,870
those things as security practitioners

89
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,319
we are there because we have an innate

90
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,000
curiosity we have this wonderful ability

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,849
to tear things apart

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
not because we're evil because we want

93
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,439
to know how they work we want to be able

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
to tear these things apart to learn and

95
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,430
when we find these things and we learn

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,040
from these mistakes that we or others

97
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,359
have made we can share those so that we

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,358
can learn from them as well

99
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,329
always got to work in the coffee breaks

100
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:52,099
so whether you are an attacker or a

101
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,890
defender we are all fundamentally

102
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,450
defenders as we go through our careers

103
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,970
if we're a pen tester if we're in

104
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,069
compliance if we are in architecture we

105
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,470
are all there primarily for the same

106
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:06,099
goal we are there to defend our

107
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,530
enterprise whatever that happens to be

108
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:11,899
corporation higher education government

109
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,820
whatever it happens to be that is our

110
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,440
shared function across the board but too

111
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,339
often we tend to get wrapped around

112
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,780
issues that just don't matter

113
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,460
we'll get wrapped around things like oh

114
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,590
it's on the dark web or it's the deep

115
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,210
dark web or we'll the one I like to coin

116
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,650
as the vanta web because apparently

117
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,948
that's the lackest of the black colors

118
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,159
and these are the kind of things that we

119
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,720
spend far too much time on my favorite

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,310
was a few years back that's quite a few

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,039
years back now there was a vulnerability

122
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,490
that was issued for a half installed

123
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,740
WordPress installation it wasn't fully

124
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,720
installed a partially installed

125
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,900
WordPress installation it was rated as

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,550
high I had to peel a CIO off the ceiling

127
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,190
and explaining them why it wasn't a

128
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,919
problem one we didn't have WordPress in

129
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,479
that particular environment too we

130
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,539
didn't have WordPress anyway we get the

131
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,510
idea but this is just it far too often

132
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,699
because of the media churn we tend to

133
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,919
lose focus and I've been perfectly

134
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,120
guilty of that throughout my career I've

135
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,590
actually had the opportunity to write

136
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
for publications like Forbes and dark

137
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,198
reading and daily swag and things like

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,580
that and earlier on I did make mistakes

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,440
where I would write about something that

140
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,889
was sensationalistic and in retrospect

141
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,229
it was not entirely correct so I did go

142
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,080
back and publish a correction which

143
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,580
unfortunately doesn't happen enough I'm

144
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,659
not going to name a certain publication

145
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,550
that talked about something in a

146
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:42,229
hardware but anyway we kind of stopped

147
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,139
trying to sell people on things that

148
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:48,080
really aren't going to be the issue we

149
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,789
need to look at things that are tackling

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,419
fundamental security issues and I just

151
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:54,919
realize there's enough for Dec hello we

152
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,409
have to look at doing the core

153
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,700
fundamentals patching logging Network

154
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,219
zone segmentation

155
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,190
user management all of these are

156
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:08,090
elements that we have known about for 25

157
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:10,850
plus years and yet we keep finding out

158
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,810
about data breaches or errors or things

159
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,130
that have happened that have led to

160
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,080
valle nur abilities led to compromise

161
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,390
that led to issues where you just went

162
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,789
on the go that didn't need to happen so

163
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,020
back in 1983 I was fortunate enough to

164
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,850
have a science teacher who had a

165
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,940
computer in his class who let mice and

166
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,670
my coworker she's my classmate and I use

167
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,140
it and he taught us basic and he did

168
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,030
things like that and we were very very

169
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,979
fortunate for that opportunity he

170
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,270
offered it to everyone in the class but

171
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,480
we were the only two that took him up on

172
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,979
it within about a week of messing around

173
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,540
on the computer we figured out how to

174
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,270
duplicate video games and sell them to

175
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,190
kids in school made a tidy little profit

176
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,020
on the side but that's where my innate

177
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,960
curiosity is like how can we go through

178
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,180
and cause trouble because it was

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
interesting and I didn't like to break

180
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,770
things because I felt it was necessary

181
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,039
to be evil I did it because I had that

182
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,049
curiosity and I was very fortunate that

183
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,410
you know a few months later my father

184
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,330
brought this thing home from work you've

185
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,870
never seen a kid so happy to use visi

186
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,359
calc in all of your life judging by the

187
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,610
giggles a few people know what that is

188
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,410
this thing occupied my every waking

189
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,530
moment to the point where my mother had

190
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,750
to drag me off it by my ear because I

191
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,400
wasn't paying attention to schoolwork or

192
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,850
anything else this was something that I

193
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,179
focused on all the time and it was just

194
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,230
a undiscovered country to me and as I

195
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,670
went through and I looked at all these

196
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,320
different things and they learned all

197
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,850
these different things and I went along

198
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,800
and I kept asking my parents I said can

199
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,960
I get magazines can I get documents can

200
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,660
I get books because we didn't have any

201
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,840
internet connection at the time it just

202
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,060
wasn't that thing back then and I kept

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,530
asking and eventually eventually I was

204
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,960
able to find the information I needed

205
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,119
eventually I was able to learn and as

206
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,349
we've gone through time we found things

207
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,940
where mistakes were made and we were

208
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,920
able to look at stuff like this it was

209
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,240
one of my favorites here because like

210
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,750
going back to when I used to duplicate

211
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,880
video games and selling the kids and

212
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,790
at one point in time Sony put out these

213
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,590
CDs with copy-protection and the whole

214
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,510
idea was that you wouldn't duplicate

215
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,739
their material and sell it not to say

216
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,130
anything about the fact that sharing

217
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,780
music leads to greater sales anyway this

218
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,210
was able to be defeated with one of

219
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,130
these with just running around the

220
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,949
outside edge of the CD you were able to

221
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,530
defeat this and sharing stories like

222
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,990
this was part of my raison d'être back

223
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,539
in 1997 when I started liquid matrix orc

224
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,450
and this is a site that still standing

225
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,099
today for whatever reason there's about

226
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,170
10 of us that work on it and we have

227
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,740
zero advertising so it's like completely

228
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:56,670
neutral the whole idea here was to share

229
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,100
stories to embrace hacker culture to

230
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,410
make people understand what these

231
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,880
security issues were of the day because

232
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,709
I remember I was working in a financial

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,720
institution back in 1998 and I was

234
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,400
sharing these various stories and people

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
said where do you keep finding these and

236
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,600
I literally had turned myself into an

237
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,339
aggregator so I started dumping them all

238
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,960
here

239
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,340
oddly enough the script actually still

240
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,660
works on the old version of the site

241
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,220
which if you know where to look he can

242
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,150
find it so I grew up in an era where

243
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,620
kids were meant to be seen not heard

244
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,689
this was a bit of an aggravation as a

245
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,590
child because I had a lot to say but I

246
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,930
wasn't allowed to say it and over time

247
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,260
it really sort of built up to the point

248
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,359
where now they just can't shut me up so

249
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,150
I really have turned that suppression

250
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,920
into a career and I've been able to take

251
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,079
it further by founding stuff like

252
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,849
besides Toronto and working on various

253
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,770
other conferences like besides Las Vegas

254
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,580
Sector Toronto and all sorts of things

255
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,300
around the world

256
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,000
the rationale here is again being able

257
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,620
to share stories be able to have things

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,910
like an event like this where you get

259
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:09,420
together and learn because unfortunately

260
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,160
hackers tends to be a term that is and

261
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,750
looked at with negativity in many

262
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,969
circles this doesn't need to be this way

263
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,400
we need to manage that narrative as the

264
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,670
collective we have to stop them from

265
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,800
using hackers as a derogatory term we

266
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,130
have to look at it and say no no those

267
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,660
are the

268
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,670
attackers that broke into your site not

269
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,030
the hackers I know that may sound

270
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,150
trivial but the attackers by saying that

271
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,920
you are showing criminal intent if you

272
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,750
have an innate curiosity about security

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,930
if you are in this room by virtue of

274
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:46,410
that you are a hacker and we have to

275
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,930
take that term back in many ways because

276
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,420
we have to learn how to manage the panic

277
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,130
that we find in the c-suite and I've

278
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,819
worked in enough organizations to know

279
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,439
that this is a real and present danger

280
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,000
when you have c-level executives that

281
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,800
are flying somewhere and they pull that

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,990
an airline magazine and read some story

283
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,810
about some security issue that has been

284
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,510
dead for over a year

285
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,040
you are spending all sorts of time and

286
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,950
effort trying to pull them off the

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,610
ceiling to explain to them why that's

288
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:19,650
not an issue when in reality as security

289
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,010
practitioners we should be taking the

290
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,290
time to educate them in advance to make

291
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:28,530
sure they understand what the

292
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,510
fundamental security issues are and we

293
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,750
have to look at things like the core

294
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:36,420
fundamentals we have to drag it back to

295
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:40,170
looking at those building blocks that we

296
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:43,079
tend to get lost on we look at the

297
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,469
Sharks we don't look at the ocean how

298
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,690
many people a year drown in oceans lakes

299
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,820
rivers how many people are eaten by

300
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:56,600
sharks numbers skew rather significantly

301
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:01,410
and we have to realize that as hackers

302
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,510
not everybody likes us it's amazing

303
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,490
every time I do this search I get a

304
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,470
different result and it gets darker and

305
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,840
darker as I go along so I just took that

306
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:13,470
one screenshot and moved on because the

307
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,590
world sees us like this the horrible

308
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,110
horrible stock image of a hacker in a

309
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,170
hoodie with thick leather gloves tapping

310
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,150
away on keyboard all right anybody in

311
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,709
this room ever used thick leather gloves

312
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,689
to type on a keyboard exactly to be fair

313
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,940
I did it once but it was 3:00 a.m. in a

314
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,990
datacenter and I was freezing but that's

315
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,459
another story entirely we need to make

316
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,790
sure that the world understands that

317
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:45,128
these are hackers could be anybody look

318
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,420
at this room indistinguishable I don't

319
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:48,639
see a single black hoodie over

320
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:53,920
somebody's head right now now there goes

321
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,839
one because people have this negative

322
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,509
bent towards us and we need to embrace

323
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,110
ourselves as well as the wider audience

324
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:04,480
so they understand who we are they have

325
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,119
to understand why we are here what is

326
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,980
our function because we are part of the

327
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:13,509
ecosystem back in 2006 I was fortunate /

328
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,529
unfortunate enough to get on the front

329
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:18,670
cover of a magazine

330
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,540
god I was pudgy back then my father's

331
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,519
reaction

332
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,740
my father was then CFO for a financial

333
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
company that will remain nameless he

334
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,980
looked at it and he said I would have

335
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:34,050
fired you because in his mind security

336
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,670
should never be seen shouldn't be heard

337
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,929
his whole thing was security should be

338
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,368
seamless I agree to a point we have to

339
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,920
be able to have open and frank

340
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:47,740
discussions about what security means

341
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,170
and if we don't have these conversations

342
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,959
we don't communicate in an effective

343
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:57,339
manner to the wider audience we end up

344
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,589
seeing the world like this we don't need

345
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:03,369
to have this negative bent towards the

346
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,959
world but on the same token we have to

347
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:06,939
stop doing things like searching on

348
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,439
shoten going wow look at look at this

349
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:11,230
idiot over here look what they did on

350
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:13,929
their website because unfortunately we

351
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,230
do this far too often and that takes

352
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:19,179
away from our collective credibility we

353
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,610
have to make sure that we were enabling

354
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,470
folks enabling companies governments

355
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,009
organizations to better secure

356
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,619
themselves rather than to ridicule them

357
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:31,809
we have to own this don't get me wrong

358
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,869
showdown is a wonderful tool but it has

359
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:36,759
to be used in the right way otherwise we

360
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,209
have to deal with the law of unintended

361
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,759
consequences we go through our careers

362
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,799
and if we ridicule users if we ridicule

363
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,370
organisation eventually they're going to

364
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,230
stop talking to us all together have you

365
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,230
ever seen a dog chasing a car down a

366
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,960
road

367
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,210
when it's just determined to catch that

368
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,950
bumper and it's going it's going finally

369
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:04,280
one day it caught that car it sunk its

370
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:08,840
teeth into the bumper and then it went

371
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:11,329
oh now what and that's just it we

372
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,420
as security are at that point in our

373
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,370
evolution we look at the medical field

374
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,719
jurisprudence all of these different

375
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,610
organized they are these different

376
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,330
verticals they have been doing their

377
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,710
craft for hundreds of years if I'm being

378
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,030
generous we've been doing this for about

379
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:32,120
25-30 years we have got a lot of

380
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,650
maturing to do collectively and now that

381
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,510
we have caught the bumper on the car now

382
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,140
that the c-suite is paying attention to

383
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,840
us we need to be the adults in the room

384
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,890
we need to effectively communicate

385
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,920
otherwise things like this are going to

386
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,750
continue to happen when one a cry

387
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,959
happened this was using a vulnerability

388
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,310
that was known for better part of over a

389
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,260
decade this was something that we could

390
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:02,060
have collectively pushed to get fixed

391
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,740
and yet we didn't because the world sees

392
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,359
us very much in a different fashion they

393
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,400
think we're making a lot of noise and

394
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,410
they're like ant we have to talk to term

395
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,380
in terms of risk we have to talk in

396
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:16,010
terms that they're going to understand

397
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,740
so that they will take us seriously at

398
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,319
the core of that we know who we are we

399
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,360
are the dog on the keyboard but the

400
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:31,010
thing is we have a different persona

401
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:33,610
online then we really do in reality data

402
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:36,230
breaches are going to keep happening

403
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,670
back in 2012 I started tracking data

404
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,040
breaches on my own site and then back

405
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,640
then six million records was considered

406
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,459
a massive data breach today wouldn't

407
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,080
even get a front page mention now we are

408
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,970
talking in orders of magnitude of

409
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,970
billions of records billions of records

410
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:03,140
how many people in here familiar with

411
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:06,500
Amazon's AWS s3 buckets show hands nice

412
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,000
excellent so if you are creating an s3

413
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,800
bucket and for those of you who may not

414
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,060
be aware an s3 buckets a data repository

415
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,190
you can spin up with a credit card in a

416
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,589
web browser and you can put all sorts of

417
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,810
manner data in there when you create one

418
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,550
this is part of the screen you see I

419
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,440
actually went through and did

420
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,079
screenshots because at one point on

421
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,640
Twitter there was this huge conversation

422
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,199
about s3 buckets and people are saying

423
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,380
oh Amazon's to be held accountable for

424
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,750
this it's like no see right there says

425
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:38,720
do not grant public read access right

426
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:41,720
there do not by default they do not

427
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,960
allow public access I say that again

428
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,540
by default they do not allow public

429
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,850
access unfortunately these buckets when

430
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,950
they are spun up it invariably it is

431
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:56,899
done by people who are not in a security

432
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,290
role so is it their fault no it's our

433
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,480
fault

434
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,480
because we have not communicated why

435
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,490
this is a problem we need to do a far

436
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,870
better job of making sure that we get

437
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,700
this message across because if we don't

438
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,489
get this message across the narrative

439
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,380
takes on a life of its own and we get

440
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,060
garbage like this

441
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,810
where trolls have gone from being a

442
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:24,200
minor annoyance to being an

443
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:26,659
institutionalized thing you have entire

444
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,630
farms of trolls that are doing their

445
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:34,130
function to change people's versions of

446
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,680
reality this is unfortunately painting

447
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,360
us collectively in a negative light

448
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,300
because the greater public lumps it's

449
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,870
all in the same bucket and that's the

450
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,490
problem

451
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,719
is that perception tends to be

452
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,820
nine-tenths of reality and the

453
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,290
perception being is that somehow hackers

454
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,110
are this magical beast that you know

455
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,490
traipse through the forest of Narnia and

456
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,580
we can just magically touch a computer

457
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,130
and we're in unfortunately part of that

458
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,169
is due to shows like mr. robot and

459
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,610
scorpion one of those shows is really

460
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,970
good one of those shows is a raging

461
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,969
nightmare

462
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,570
but that's just it we need to manage

463
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,220
those perceptions so with an

464
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,050
organization if they hire somebody to do

465
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,330
web security do they just hire a baker

466
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,190
or somebody who actually knows what

467
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,470
they're doing not to say that a baker

468
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,590
can't do security but in all likelihood

469
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:27,260
if their thing is baguettes you're

470
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,360
really not going to get too far would

471
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:35,300
you use a surgeon to lock down your

472
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:37,040
voter database no would you expect the

473
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,889
philosopher to run your security

474
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,170
practice when all they've ever done is

475
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,080
protect their own version of events as

476
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,550
opposed to the wider good we want to

477
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,860
make sure that we are putting the right

478
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,080
people in the right positions all of

479
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,760
those three examples could perfectly be

480
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,500
security people if they were trained up

481
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,120
but you wouldn't hire them straight out

482
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,900
of their job into a new role and say

483
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,250
you're in charge now in the United

484
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,870
States the White House that just

485
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,270
offended they just pointed out that they

486
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,919
have lost 12 security practitioners in

487
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,389
the last couple months 12 of them they

488
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,220
have given up their entire security

489
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,370
practice and it's really insane because

490
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,320
bad things are going to happen back in

491
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,360
2016 there was this article that came

492
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,399
out about a hacker who came forward and

493
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,000
said he helped manipulate the results of

494
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,160
an election in Mexico at the time

495
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,490
everybody were like yeah that's not that

496
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:35,380
never happens hello jump forward to the

497
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:38,380
future sometimes the old ways work in

498
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,850
Canada we still use paper ballots

499
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,760
granted we do have scanning machines to

500
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,730
count the ballots but we have that audit

501
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,530
trail that's available to us

502
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,170
the Americans have machines with no

503
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,030
audit trail in many cases if you've been

504
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,860
to DEFCON they have an entire village

505
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,990
dedicated to looking at these machines

506
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,080
to tearing them apart if you ever get a

507
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,750
chance to see that I highly recommend it

508
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,179
and if we look at these things in a sane

509
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,220
light we understand that hackers have a

510
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,320
core function we are there to poke

511
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,010
things in the eye in a constructive

512
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,860
fashion much like sharks if you remove

513
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,230
us from the ecosystem bad things are

514
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,199
going to happen

515
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:24,399
sharks serve a real purpose

516
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,230
very much as hackers do we tend to worry

517
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:27,850
too much about threats we tend to get

518
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,619
wrapped around the axle about things

519
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,519
that really aren't a problem like a

520
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:34,959
zero-day and an AIX box from X number of

521
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,519
years ago and when you're running an

522
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,769
entire window shop or whatever it

523
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,619
happens to be you have to really start

524
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:43,629
managing what those expectations are and

525
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,340
communicating that effectively to senior

526
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:47,408
management and then when I say

527
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,389
effectively we have to get to end a job

528
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:51,450
because otherwise we end up in what we

529
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:53,678
call analysis paralysis

530
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,879
at one point I was working at a power

531
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
company I don't know how he got a boat

532
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:57,820
and still got stuck there but that's

533
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,639
another thing I was working at a power

534
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,009
company years ago and I found well in

535
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:05,199
conjunction with my team to be honest we

536
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:08,739
found a vulnerability that would have

537
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,559
really caused some significant damage if

538
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,639
it was exposed to the Internet

539
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,678
when we went to him we said look we need

540
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:19,199
to get this fixed the CIO said you have

541
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,549
five minutes convinced me I was like oh

542
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,399
because he meant convince him in terms

543
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:26,440
he understood luckily in two and a half

544
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:28,719
minutes I was able to convince him as to

545
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,460
the risk the financial penalties that

546
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,980
would be incurred the damage that could

547
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,929
be done from a reputational perspective

548
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,539
without running around with my hair on

549
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,950
fire it worked we were able to get the

550
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,970
things that we needed in order to remedy

551
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,299
the situation

552
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,559
but had I not approached it in that

553
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,799
manner he would have thrown me out of

554
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
his office

555
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,649
hackers go through and we look for these

556
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:52,960
vulnerabilities and we look for these

557
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:54,820
issues to remove them from the food

558
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,980
chain much in the same way as sharks

559
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,710
keep food stocks down to a manageable

560
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,450
level because if you have too much of a

561
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,279
food stock eventually they end up

562
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:07,509
overpopulated in getting sick dying

563
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:09,609
causing all sorts of decay and that's

564
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:14,220
not good and if you remove hackers from

565
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:14,220
the Scituate from the from the stage

566
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,100
then we're going to have a greater

567
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,779
problem in that there's gonna be so many

568
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,730
vulnerabilities that only the bad guys

569
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:23,980
only the attackers are gonna have the

570
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,850
ability to get in there have been some

571
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,519
countries in the world that have

572
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:31,599
legislated against hackers and this does

573
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,760
concern me now sharks typically don't

574
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,350
get sick

575
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,760
something about them that allows them to

576
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,490
be resilient and they've been roughly

577
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,730
the same design for eons well not that

578
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,620
long but a very very long time so they

579
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,460
have all sorts of different properties

580
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,899
that allow them benefits that we would

581
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,710
not have otherwise appreciated as

582
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:56,470
hackers we think differently we don't

583
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,450
look at a ABC approach we have not a

584
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,690
linear we definitely have a lateral way

585
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,610
of thinking and this is a good thing so

586
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:07,980
we need to use those abilities to help

587
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,979
better educate to build better systems

588
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:15,129
sharks keep the carbon footprint of the

589
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:18,010
world in motion as fish die-off they are

590
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,990
able to eat up eat away the dead fish so

591
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,120
that they do not rot and produce more

592
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:26,080
carbon they actually have a serious

593
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,199
positive function we as attackers not

594
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,639
attackers sorry who we as hackers go

595
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,590
through and we find these low-hanging

596
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,300
fruit we find these systems and we go

597
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,149
into them and we find the issues and

598
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,490
help them remediate that so that we

599
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:45,910
don't have all of this detritus that

600
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:50,350
leads to a unsafe and unsafe internet we

601
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:51,940
need to inspire better design at one

602
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,820
point in my career I was working as one

603
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,429
organization where we had two physical

604
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,189
locations and we were using BGP to

605
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:02,170
manage the route you took based on where

606
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,080
you were in the world to which system

607
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,740
you would go to on the surface that

608
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,210
sound like a good idea but these two

609
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,920
systems these two systems these two

610
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,010
buildings were less than 20 kilometers

611
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,020
apart so it's pretty much a trivial

612
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,030
exercise to do this so we changed it and

613
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,770
we said well what if it was under attack

614
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,320
what if you were trying to knock these

615
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,420
systems down so we built one side that

616
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,820
was a primary and another side that was

617
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,679
a hot standby and they would failover

618
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,480
automatically depending on what happened

619
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,130
you could take systems offline and it

620
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,630
would failover automatically using

621
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,270
things like vrrp and things to that

622
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,400
effect because we approached it as if it

623
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,350
was under attack we said how can we

624
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,950
design this system so that it is

625
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,949
resilient

626
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,710
sharks the the inspire smart design

627
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,169
because you look at it built into cars

628
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,210
motorcycles airplanes all sorts of

629
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:58,360
things where people are learning from

630
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,860
them even swimmers because of the nature

631
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,659
of their scales they are able to go

632
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,090
faster that has inspired new suit

633
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,650
designs for Olympic swimmers so that

634
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,770
they can go faster through the water as

635
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:12,340
well a design is a key element you want

636
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:16,960
to democratize security how many people

637
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,600
in here have their parents using PGP now

638
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,330
don't get me wrong I like PGP but it is

639
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,389
not a user-friendly experience if we

640
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:28,360
want people outside of this room to use

641
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:32,920
security we have to give them the tools

642
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,510
that they can use a hammer can build a

643
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,060
house or it can bludgeon you about the

644
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,920
head and neck it's how you use it but if

645
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,220
you give them a tool that is very clear

646
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,350
like a spoon full credit to my boss one

647
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,430
day neither its kind of hard to mess up

648
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,070
using a spoon design is a key piece of

649
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,770
the puzzle and we need to democratize

650
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:57,240
security and when I say that the whole

651
00:26:53,770 --> 00:27:00,639
purpose is to make it more accessible

652
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,930
because if we don't do that then more

653
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,220
and more people are going to diverge

654
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,930
away from that and they're going to go

655
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,050
back to sticking their passwords on

656
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:11,580
sticky notes on the side of a screen and

657
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,580
we get rid of that with things like web

658
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,820
authentic in an open standard

659
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,570
I gave this talk of this well not this

660
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:28,659
talk but I talked about web authentic

661
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,159
product and we know this is very much an

662
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,070
open standards that's why I hammer away

663
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,900
on that this is a way to do access the

664
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,139
systems without having a static username

665
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,570
and password this is the kind of thing

666
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:45,010
that we can use to improve security

667
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:47,889
across the board and together we have

668
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:50,610
safety in numbers we are able to get the

669
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:55,910
message apart apart of cross rather in

670
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:57,530
an effective way now

671
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,990
back in 2003 I was working for a Power

672
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,840
Company in Ontario when we had a massive

673
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,500
blackout this took out all of North

674
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,360
America

675
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,560
I was at a tennis match and I was

676
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,969
watching it and then the lights went out

677
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,159
in the stadium and I went okay that's

678
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,230
crazy this was a vendor event of course

679
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,030
and I'm sitting there going okay that's

680
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,710
different and it was the middle there at

681
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,780
4 o'clock in the afternoon so I figured

682
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,440
it was okay and that power would come

683
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,750
back shortly

684
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,000
it didn't about three minutes later my

685
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,740
phone rang my boss said you got to get

686
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,360
in here I said what's up

687
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,910
he was power out and I said yeah I can

688
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:33,560
see that how bad he goes bad said

689
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,300
Toronto no Ontario keep going damn I'll

690
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,830
be right there so what should have been

691
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,409
a 20 minute drive back to the office

692
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,570
ended up being two hours because every

693
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,940
light in the city was out every street

694
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,770
light was out thankfully my fellow

695
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,230
citizens in Toronto were good enough to

696
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:50,150
manage traffic but they weren't this

697
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,060
wasn't their forte but they were out

698
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,990
there trying collectively we pulled

699
00:28:53,060 --> 00:29:01,879
together to make things better as

700
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:05,300
hackers we can do the same now in my

701
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,040
career I have had the the ability to go

702
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,100
through and do a lot of security

703
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,770
research before I had kids and back when

704
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,929
I had free time and the last time I did

705
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,040
any sort of research was 2008 and I

706
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:21,080
found all sorts of vulnerabilities and

707
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:24,200
it was a trivial exercise for me to do

708
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,090
because this wasn't my forte of doing

709
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,130
you know bonafide security research I

710
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,750
didn't have any support mechanisms in

711
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,790
place I just happen to have a lab and

712
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,010
all the tools at my disposal so I just

713
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:36,560
started poking away at them and it was

714
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,120
actually amazed at what I found and in

715
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,679
some cases when I communicated these

716
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,429
things to the various organisation web

717
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,100
since was fantastic they patched the

718
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,900
thing that I found and pushed out the

719
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,520
patch to their customers in under two

720
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,830
hours that was amazing and then we owe

721
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,980
that look at the other ones here there

722
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:00,560
are so many of these that were just they

723
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,540
were fun to work with the Cisco folks

724
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,440
back before I worked for Cisco I found a

725
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,879
phone there being one of their tools

726
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,530
send it to them they've patched it and

727
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,700
sent me the fix and fortunately in the

728
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,990
fix there was another problem and they

729
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,650
fixed that right away it was all done in

730
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,220
a

731
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:18,110
it was amazing one company who's not on

732
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:21,830
that list wasn't so forthcoming they

733
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:25,010
threatened me they said we will sue you

734
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:28,899
into oblivion they told me they knew

735
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:33,920
people this is a massive international

736
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:35,540
corporation this was at a time where I

737
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,620
did not have the resources or the

738
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:42,530
capacity to fight back one of these days

739
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:45,739
I might write about it but at this point

740
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,480
in my career I will not these are the

741
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,140
sort of things where I had no support

742
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,270
mechanisms in place but there are things

743
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,540
like that now where we have or talk

744
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,200
about bug bounties bug bounties love

745
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,659
them or hate them

746
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,810
this is not something I ever imagined

747
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,030
would exist back in 2008 and this is

748
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,919
just an example of hackers pulling

749
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:11,210
together to help build a better future

750
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:17,300
and we do have that within our capacity

751
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:20,830
to do this was an idea that I never

752
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:25,070
thought would come to fruition ever and

753
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:30,860
yet people will pitch ideas that are

754
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:32,480
just seem abject ly terrible and then

755
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:37,780
six or seven movies later they're still

756
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,460
making these things if you have an idea

757
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:43,970
bring it forward share it with your

758
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,380
community you have a community here you

759
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,150
have communities around the world you

760
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,360
have organizations you can get involved

761
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,940
with to give your ability your voice a

762
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,479
to part of the collective so that we can

763
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,330
make a better future for ourselves so

764
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:02,720
where do we go from here we need to

765
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:07,100
manage the narrative we need to mature

766
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:10,850
as a vertical as security practitioners

767
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,010
so that the c-suite doesn't fear us so

768
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:18,679
that the public at large see s as a

769
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:21,680
benefit we are the dog that caught the

770
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,490
bumper we really do have to figure out

771
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,490
what to do with it now

772
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,049
organizations have to understand the

773
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,399
benefit that hackers bring to the table

774
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,900
not these scary mysterious characters

775
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,470
that can touch I monitor and poof we're

776
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,150
in because it doesn't work that way I've

777
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,419
done enough pen test to know it does not

778
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,950
work that way as we go through this both

779
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,480
sides of the fence need to come together

780
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,660
to have these conversations to

781
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,150
understand the benefit much like sharks

782
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,740
we have to understand they aren't the

783
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:57,030
threat the ocean is a threat we have to

784
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,530
look at things in their proper

785
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:03,990
perspective as hackers we need to

786
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:06,870
embrace the organization's so that they

787
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:10,260
understand what we expect of them we

788
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,729
have to not ridicule them as hackers we

789
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,340
have to look at within ourselves and

790
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:17,190
figure out how we can come together to

791
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,928
do what we do in a way that is going to

792
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:24,600
be accepted on a wider plane we can do

793
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:27,390
this we can move forward we can get back

794
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,240
to the core fundamentals we need to

795
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:32,870
embrace the hackers thank you very much

796
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,870
for your time today

797
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,180
and I don't know if I'm doing questions

798
00:33:43,480 --> 00:34:02,200
but I got a couple minutes if anybody

799
00:33:46,180 --> 00:34:04,510
has any no yes so the question was how

800
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,030
was my what was my reaction when the

801
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,590
company threatened to sue me it was not

802
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:13,179
a good conversation

803
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:15,040
I was absolutely beside myself and I did

804
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:18,100
lose sleep over it and it was really an

805
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,139
upsetting endeavor and I really wish I

806
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,380
did have the benefit of having bug

807
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,850
bounty programs FF anything like that

808
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,110
that is available today so there are a

809
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,580
lot of support mechanisms that are

810
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:35,470
available today that weren't around at

811
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:38,759
that time Cheers we got a mic up here if

812
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,759
there's anybody else I think

813
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:47,980
all right the mics dead any other

814
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:51,719
questions I can repeat them back no all

815
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,719
right well enjoy the conference

816
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,920
you
