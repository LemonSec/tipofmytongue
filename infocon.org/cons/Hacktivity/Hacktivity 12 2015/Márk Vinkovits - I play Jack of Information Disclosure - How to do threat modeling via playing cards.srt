4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,410
way who is not on Facebook or Instagram
I know that thank you very much so

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,750
before you fall asleep because of the
food they get the little bit activity up

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,040
because the conference we are talking
about the other kinds of fun stuff so

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,230
please hurry up cuz you're going to hear
a mind blowing for the nation right now

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,440
this presentation is going on about
competition and this presentation is

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,670
going to talk about the real threats of
life the real dangers you have to face

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,010
this presentation is going to take over
on your mind that will take over

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,370
yourselves and this is a sad I'm looking
at the security engineer at Longman so

12
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,930
this is a slight people usually talk
about themselves but I don't want to

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,110
tell too much but little disclaimer for
a talk first of all as I stand here

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,159
right now I'm a profit if you would
search Google for profit at this instant

15
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,670
it will draw pictures of me it's you I'm
going to give you a word of wisdom and

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,150
going to give you the truth and its role
beauty so sit back except everything I'm

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,409
telling you unconditionally but remember
if you go home and it doesn't work then

18
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,460
blame me I'm just a profit I'm giving no
guarantees here so the Prophet what i'm

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,908
saying is that it is not going to end
well I don't know if you heard it at

20
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,950
this conference are you headed that i
dont conferences are going to hear that

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,890
security is broken everything is lost
you cannot do anything and I'm telling

22
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,520
you that's not the case and I'm going to
give you a solution I'm going to give

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,100
you a solution to helping us to a better
marriage to your car consuming less than

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,298
what I'm going to tell you it's not
magic so it's a very simple everyone can

25
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,340
do it so if you have no scar on your
forehead or the force is not strong

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,229
within you don't worry this talk is
exactly for you but if you are too kind

27
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,679
of security engineer who always says no
and its cannot be done but hope it is

28
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,330
going to take away so let's talk about
traveling

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,540
before we start playing cards because I
know that's what everybody came from

30
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,679
four that's what discuss what's
troubling is how you should do it what

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,670
the purpose of it is and why struggling
is like unit testing or playing Texas no

32
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,640
one does it but before they go into
strapon the first let's go and find out

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,339
what the threat it because a lot of
trouble already begins with the

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,910
misinterpretation of this work now when
I was searching the internet for what a

35
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,780
threat is this is the picture iPhone it
seems all real nice like

36
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,380
disrupts your dad set your balance is at
1:30 now if you think about it if a

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,150
crocodile would be a threat

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,560
the words crippling would be something
like this

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,580
ok this is no bus traveling is a low so
I'm going to give you a more proper

40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,630
definition of the threat is from the
European network and information

41
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,940
security agency but it says a threat as
any circumstance or event I like to add

42
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,930
person here with the potential to
adversely impact an asset to authorize

43
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,489
excess destruction disclosure
modification of data and/or denial of

44
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:28,150
service

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,730
no I can't give you a picture as much as
the goddess but I'm going to give you

46
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,970
the picture that allows provides here
I'm going to guide you through this

47
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,810
picture of what it is all about the
first of all a threat

48
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,590
starts this red agent there is always a
threat agents of the crocodiles in the

49
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,519
picture that would have been a threat
agents no threat agent modeling would

50
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,870
have made sense them and also a threat
always impact and exit more important is

51
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,760
the impact something with a business
impact so me drinking on this preso or

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,730
Ethiopian at the booth that's hoping
that the threat because it doesn't have

53
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,230
a business impact for you and finally as
always goes through some kind of

54
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:16,209
weakness through some kind of attack so
when you get an attack which tries to

55
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,390
adversely affect our system then you are
really talking about the threat so to

56
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,330
summarize a threat is not something like
a ubiquitous and it is not

57
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,560
the NSA which is a threat but rather
something very specific you can action

58
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,069
on you can deal with it you can do
something about it

59
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:41,370
ok now if I discuss threat that's also
discuss what modeling should be about

60
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,050
the modeling with the words of moment
does should consider three main things

61
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,759
which are the target audience the
purpose and the scope and I'm going to

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,539
go through this from the bottom because
it's easier to spend it that they're so

63
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,449
what is the scope of threat modeling the
lobbyists see the Scopus rattling should

64
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,840
be our system or your software or
something like that so that's easy

65
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,560
what's the purpose of strapon thing but
the purpose of threat modeling should be

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,560
to make the system more secure now let's
stop here because a lot of people under

67
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,360
threat modeling to make the system more
secure but rather to generate a report

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,669
or a trade paper planes or whatever so
whenever you had the purpose of things

69
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,770
that I just mentioned it's going to take
away so please if you are doing strip

70
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,770
morning always think about how can I
make the system more secure by doing the

71
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:48,159
ceremony and finally target audience
know who the target audience it's

72
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,770
important that as much as said you
consider your target audience you know

73
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,878
who is going to read this what it can do
about this and how we can deal with it

74
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,099
so just handing out a report by itself
is not going to happen as long as a

75
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,128
matter of fact if you doing it that way
the target audience probably look

76
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,180
something like this you can recognize as
you reach your target audience you can

77
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,750
recognize it by words saying I didn't
get it landed in my spam filter sorry I

78
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,860
have a new mail agent I don't know how
it works

79
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,810
order my favorite days have a new laptop
I haven't got mail on it yet so if you

80
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,509
hear any of these sentences you know you
reach your target audience if you ever

81
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:35,149
heard the sentence before I beg you
never do threatening again because if

82
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:38,849
you reach your target audience like this
you really started

83
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,979
an epic battle you started the epic
battle between security and development

84
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:55,719
now as I've been on both sides I'm
allowed to talk about this epic battle

85
00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:00,689
obviously Mortal Kombat is much better
so I'm on the better side of it but

86
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,259
that's not the point but let's start
with what security engineers think of

87
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,039
this battle security engineers are
always complaining that they didn't get

88
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,610
a proper description of the system
they're complaining that the system they

89
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,240
are testing is not up to date the
documentation is not appropriate

90
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,019
they say the engineers dunno what the
system should be actually doing they say

91
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:31,990
the discussions to fuzzy they say it's
raining hangover whatever so they're

92
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,330
going to complain why they cannot
provide you a proper job now looking on

93
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,019
the other side of the developers of the
security engineers are going to say when

94
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:47,029
they receive a report that they can't do
anything about this it's it doesn't make

95
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,860
sense it does say well this report has
been created the diversion we had two

96
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,839
months ago so it's going to look at it
and say well I don't even understand the

97
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,930
threats which are described you dare
irrelevant that's nothing I could do

98
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,169
about this it's not a development
paucity of addis it's something

99
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:13,508
completely out of my scope so sorry but
have you look at this picture who is

100
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:19,969
that guy that everyone is happy in that
picture he's like oh my god help me I

101
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,509
think he was showing I've been kidnapped
this is the second dress I have to work

102
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:33,209
now let's keep this program so let's say
he is or developer his cat so when we

103
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,468
think about our target audience let me
think about their average developer what

104
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,509
are the things we should assume a
developer is that good technician he

105
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:49,459
knows his technology he knows the system
is working with probably his quite

106
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,099
proficient in it and he's going to
understand

107
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,790
plane technical English but this is
something security engineers don't

108
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,680
consider they think developers are not
going to understand me they're speaking

109
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,550
the same language as you are if you try
to and most importantly developers are

110
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,660
proud of their craftsmanship they're
proud of what they're doing they're

111
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,740
proud what they are delivering and they
want to provide could suffer if you give

112
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,319
them the circumstances on the
possibilities are going to deal with the

113
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,439
important stuff if you are working with
them and telling them how to make

114
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,709
something even better

115
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:29,739
absolutely happy to work with you if you
let them and if you are co-operating

116
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,170
with them now having gone through the
different aspects of modeling that's

117
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:45,389
finally go into threat modeling you an
example now I have to stop here this is

118
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,550
the only slight I have a bullet points
I'm really sorry about it I had no idea

119
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,979
how to prevent this in a different way
if you ask me I'm completely against

120
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,360
militants if there was a petition
against pull it wise I would sign it

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,790
immediately I saw a headline just the
last time it said something murder by

122
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,490
bullet points or something like that so
let's go through this like what are the

123
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,319
steps a threat modeling first of all you
have to identify your objectives survey

124
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:20,370
open application and to compose it and
then you identify document and trade the

125
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:30,029
threats so let's something missing here
anyway so if you think again about your

126
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,230
target audience is going to understand
as well this is quite clear at this

127
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,209
morning right there's nothing fancy
about these steps so your developers

128
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:46,229
specifically can can work with this now
I said we're going to be an example so

129
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,230
the example is going to be a damn viable
option now but I like you to do when we

130
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,360
talk about this damn about that show is
that you imagine all kinds of

131
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,870
functionality you know from about show
up and saying it is in there ok so if

132
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,899
you so and this thing and you think it's
relevant

133
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,160
let's assume this functionality is in
this but if you quickly so away what are

134
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,889
the damn that's up consists of it
consists of upside obviously the website

135
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,230
has an integrated admin functionality
will have a backend server for all the

136
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,980
logic is running the server is going to
have a configuration video production

137
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,619
keys with connection strings with the
keys to external services are going to

138
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:37,119
have a database of a product and you're
going to have a major say where you can

139
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:44,089
send out announcements or update adds
sand shipping information but you can

140
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:49,689
also receive orders by hand the mail
server which employees are going to put

141
00:11:49,689 --> 00:12:01,139
into the database now the second step of
for traveling was well okay so this tax

142
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:09,949
should be saying and so what are your
assets your assets are you want to

143
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:13,479
protect your interests of infrastructure
obviously you want to protect your

144
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,879
customer data hopefully you have some
privilege employee accounts in your

145
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,870
system and you want to protect the
reputation of your company and the

146
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,480
question is is this understandable for a
target audience again there's nothing

147
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,980
difficult about this so if you explain
this to a developer should be fine

148
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,939
dealing with this ok so the next steps
of the strap modeling was to serve me up

149
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:45,110
at the occasion they compose it now I
already presented a high level diagram

150
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:53,009
but what we usually do israel data flow
diagram of the system now when I'm doing

151
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:57,850
this usually involves the developer so
we sit together with the developers and

152
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,329
talk about the system draw this time
around together and identify what's

153
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,829
happening while data flow diagram is
really good for this purpose is because

154
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,729
they are you can identify the trust
boundary of your system and you can say

155
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,720
what kind of data is leaving your system
what kind of there is coming

156
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:23,639
again doesn't develop understand this
obviously understands it I would also

157
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,980
emphasized involve your developers into
doing this because my experience was

158
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,149
that I am both senior developers and was
working with them about drawing up the

159
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:38,560
diagram most developers who this is how
our system works but he didn't say but

160
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,119
he really didn't know how the system
works until I saw the diagram of it now

161
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,220
for the next steps I'm going to divide
the state into two parts so we're going

162
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,069
to talk about the classical approach of
threatening and I'm going to talk about

163
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:58,029
the game at five approach to modeling so
and there the stage classical approach

164
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:09,439
the threat following these last three
steps which are identifying threats

165
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:14,699
document them and rape them specifically
now only talking about the classical

166
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:20,240
approach now the first time my boss came
to me and said well could you do

167
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,490
threaten other than with this team I was
like yes sure is and isn't it so I've

168
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,600
heard about it I've learned about inside
so just do some literature research and

169
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,439
I'm going to find all the details about
the magic how to do it what is the best

170
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:41,079
methodology how to identify the really
important threats how to rate the risks

171
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,870
of these items now as it turns out
what's out there regarding methodology

172
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,730
for straightening it's really
disappointing so you actually are going

173
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,889
to get no real help into doing it let me
show you some examples so as I was

174
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,819
searching the literature this was the
first piece of advice that I came across

175
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:05,649
it says bring members of the development
and test teams together to conduct an

176
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,639
informed brainstorming session in front
of ID book now I don't know how you are

177
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,620
I have no clue what an informed
brainstorming should have never heard of

178
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,639
something as an informed brainstorming
but it must be something if there's a

179
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
whiteboard it gets informed or something

180
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,160
ok so this didn't help so I moved on to
the next piece which said you got a set

181
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,000
of experience

182
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,180
experts in a room gives them away to
take notes let them go

183
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,370
the quality of the brain storm is bound
by the experience of the rain Stormers

184
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:45,950
and the amount of time spent now really
its experience and time spent that's

185
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,070
what's going to define your Scrabble got
to sort of question is how much time

186
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,330
what how much time do I need for a good
stretch everybody's going to tell it

187
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:03,380
depends how complex the system is how
good your experts are whole many threats

188
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,350
you want to identify ok this is not
having there must be some more specific

189
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,320
information how much time I need so I
read this line over and over they

190
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,930
realized it actually gives you a hint
about it it tells you you have to let

191
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,910
them go so put your security engineers
in the room to provide a good step auto

192
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:30,530
and that they're gone you'll never see
them again have to let them go but this

193
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,860
is something which is make me said it
was like this so let's move on there

194
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,970
must be something good out there right
so I started looking at all kinds of

195
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,930
lectures lectures and YouTube videos so
one guy said the search process that you

196
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,120
are going to go through is what are all
the different types of attacks that

197
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,700
could make sense for the threat agent to
get to the ass so reading this goes

198
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,240
through all the different types of
attacks I don't know if you're familiar

199
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,790
with the current business information it
contains 1,000 items if you go through

200
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,349
all the permutations a threat agent and
asset and was housing types of attacks

201
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,929
that's not assault process if if you try
to do that ass up you're going to

202
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,089
explode so quickly let's move on to the
next one is just says most security

203
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:27,550
professionals can just sink and know
what that all comes to our right that's

204
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,300
all you have to do you just think I know
everything so next time this guy comes

205
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,080
along as a security engineer you should
hire him because he can just saying

206
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,840
enough although it comes there are no if
this is the advice we can give a

207
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,530
methodology I don't know what

208
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:49,210
we expect the next steps but let's try
so documenting erasing the threats the

209
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,450
report as usual going to look something
like this I would like to take a moment

210
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:08,360
and take this report and write it talks
about threats it talks about effort and

211
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,020
impact and possible controls so this is
something you can give to your

212
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,910
developers that they should work with
this right no way if you get this is

213
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,870
going to kill you he's going to use
those two fingers and cozy lagging he's

214
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,979
going to cause you pain and death

215
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,440
really if you look at some of the
sentences here ok I know this is an

216
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,720
example I told took for a vote from the
system

217
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,440
a look at the sentences it says waterbed
its elections are excess of election

218
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,410
information system by individuals
authorized access to these machines

219
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,410
resulting in the loss of water problem
what i don't understand that sentence

220
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,920
and if I understood what could they do
about this it's completely irrelevant

221
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,540
there's nothing you can do but this is
just telling you what you shouldn't do

222
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,520
it telling you what the program can be
if we take this example and tried to

223
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,530
apply it to different field that's a
flight to architecture if I'm telling

224
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,110
architects what could go wrong this is
what you get the car may get stolen on

225
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:17,699
the ground floor or the overhead cables
made your down or I don't even know what

226
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,900
I don't know guests might be insulted by
Wilbert straights or something like that

227
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,280
so if you're doing something like this
if you're just telling people what could

228
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,930
go wrong but they shouldn't do again
please stop doing it you're just harming

229
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:42,260
you're just starting that big meadow
such a different job please let's talk

230
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:49,629
about the game if I approached it again
going through these three steps

231
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:58,830
so the first it says identify threats
for which you can use the game

232
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,879
cornucopia elevation of privilege so
this two games are quite similar

233
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,910
cornucopia has a more focused approach
to web applications

234
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:14,320
elevation of privilege tries to be a
little bit more generic discussing the

235
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,280
wider class of attacks and as a matter
of fact these gains really worked like a

236
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,070
card game so what you do is you get your
developers senior engineers their

237
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,159
security engineer in one room and you're
going to hand out the cards in there and

238
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,480
so then you play in a row and always
playing one color at a time so everyone

239
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,530
has to play the specified color and the
person with the highest court in the

240
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:46,360
round is going to get a point so that's
quite easy addition to it is that each

241
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,929
card contains a description of a threat
so when you're playing the card it try

242
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,680
to apply thats threat to your system you
try to identify some specific threat in

243
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,050
your system that could be exploited and
if you succeed in finding something

244
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,570
you'll get a point for debt so in the
end you will have someone with the most

245
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,889
points so there's also some kind of
reward them for the winner or some kind

246
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,670
of motivation to participate in this
game so let's look at details and whole

247
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:28,960
car looks card has a suit the suit is
different classes of attacks or threats

248
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,250
so the suits are also indication of
stories asian data validation

249
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,990
cryptography session management and then
you've got a overall class which is

250
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,880
cornucopia then the card is going to
have a rank so they hired rank is the

251
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,570
more severe the threat will be to our
system also this is going to define like

252
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,639
who won the round of the game and the
most important part of the card is the

253
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,600
description of the threat so every time
someone plays the card is reading this

254
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,070
read aloud and he's trying to apply this
threat to the specified system they are

255
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,010
investigating but if there are any
questions about what this red is or what

256
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,060
to do about it

257
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,330
there are also a number of references on
the card like today less secure coding

258
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,110
practices or defecation security
verification standard for the coming at

259
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,250
a pattern and admiration so if you've
got troubles and what to do about it

260
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:35,440
there's also little additional material
you could look into this can understand

261
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,150
this

262
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,150
yeah of course you can understand it
absolutely natural English language with

263
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,480
a lot of addition if he has any problems
it's a simple game he just have to

264
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,340
participate in and it's going to use all
the experience and knowledge he has

265
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,560
about it so what they're going to do
next are going to play again so some of

266
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,659
you received cards when they came in so
they're going to use or damn that sharp

267
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:08,800
to try out how it works to apply the
threats from the cards to this system so

268
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,060
let me recap what we're going to do
you're going to go one suit by the time

269
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,030
so we're going to start with the suit
authentication everyone who has a card

270
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,800
with authentication on it should read
whether they find how does threat could

271
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:29,169
be applied to the system and then you
put your hands up your going to read

272
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,420
aloud the description of the threat I'm
going to look how to apply that threat

273
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,300
to this system and then we are finished
with authentication we're going to move

274
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,810
on so the point is to play the highest
rank card in the given suits so if you

275
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,669
start by playing the four of us
indication the next person should try to

276
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:55,480
play something higher like the 8th or
the Jack of authentication so first of

277
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,860
all who has an authentication card in
their hand please hands up there must be

278
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,360
more than 90

279
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,549
ok so please have a look at your
authentication card read the threat to

280
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,670
find on it and remember this is a
typical of a shop which is damn warned

281
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:20,380
about so probably I was certainly that's
right you have in your hand is going to

282
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,540
apply to this system so they can check
the spread on your card and if you find

283
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,010
where your card could be applied to the
system raise your hand I'm going to look

284
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,750
it up

285
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:45,010
could he had some lights audience so
they can read the cards thank you so so

286
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,150
anyone who can apply an authentication
card in their hand please raise your

287
00:24:49,150 --> 00:25:00,290
hand take my notes I know what cards you
have well you can sing of problems like

288
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,220
finding out user names in the system
that's something you shouldn't be able

289
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:10,090
to find out how could you find the user
names in the system

290
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:29,750
bring the rank is for yet set by Stan
can easily identify user names and you

291
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:39,090
could identify user names in this system
so as I said it's a typical web

292
00:25:39,090 --> 00:26:06,418
application how do you usually find user
names in the system

293
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:23,830
those are great but in the customer
reviews you can find the user names by

294
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,668
trying to register and the telling you
about this

295
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:46,889
yeah yeah ok so the recording can hear
it now let's move on we've been kinda

296
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:53,059
limited time so next card so we had four
of us indication any higher cards and

297
00:26:53,059 --> 00:27:04,249
authentication there you go

298
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:08,730
listener can use brute force and
dictionary attacks against one or many

299
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,659
accounts without limit all these attacks
are simply fight due to insufficient

300
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,980
complexity length exploration and we use
requirements for us works great so how

301
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,690
can you apply this where where would you
try to brute force password is here in

302
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,710
the setback to login server login or you
could use a simple log-in for him

303
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,429
because there are no cap shows there is
no struggling on them and nothing like

304
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:42,609
that ok so anyone with a higher court in
authentication

305
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:48,158
ok so let's move on seven of us
indication one next let's go through

306
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,679
authorization so alteration cars who has
also relation cards let me see it

307
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:03,730
ok so try to apply the spread on your
card to the system and if you can please

308
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:12,410
put up your hands so they can go there
with the mic

309
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:25,040
authorization ok there you got my
opponent

310
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,360
so their rank is Jack ok then
disconnects our security configuration

311
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:43,469
information or access control lists ok
this happen actually Denise can access

312
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,790
to the logs and believe these things and
if you look at the diagram so that's why

313
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:55,030
it's important to have a data flow
diagram I don't have so here you see

314
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,810
that employees can actually access the
web configuration so they're going to be

315
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:04,490
able to access all the server
configuration unrolled information like

316
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:11,490
logs and whatever which you probably
shouldn't do okay so well that was

317
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:18,390
already the highest Cardinal Association
so let's move on to data validation

318
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:24,080
ok the joker card yeah you can play the
joker card at any moment that that's

319
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:35,460
your privilege to get them so I also
access the database and maybe

320
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,340
big issue yeah exactly so you should
limit access to a database because he

321
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,100
said that there are manual product
request for orders which employees are

322
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,740
going to ride into the database manually
so that's something you shouldn't do you

323
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,570
should limit who has access to the
database and most of her stuff shouldn't

324
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,059
had access to it so great to text thank
you

325
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:06,070
anything in data validation there you go

326
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,750
alright I got a king with says Gabe can
inject data in the server-side

327
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,580
interpreter SQL commands experts
oversight JavaScript SMTP because I

328
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,449
strongly tied parameterize interface is
now being used or has not been

329
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,580
implemented to correct I would start by
the login form

330
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,949
yeah logging or simply sequel injections
by the user password field whatever it's

331
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:37,970
making yeah it's a king so it was
already the highest card so we've

332
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:47,200
cryptography anyone cryptography guard
that you got the lowest free of

333
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,649
cryptography axle can modify transcended
permanent data store or distort or in

334
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:56,139
transit or sore score updates patches or
configuration data because it is not

335
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,700
subject into checking where would that
happen here I think basically can do it

336
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,630
anywhere but one interesting point is I
don't updates or patches so you can't

337
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,659
treat work with the coat so so the
webshop da something different for

338
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,880
example it doesn't get it logs orders
for someone else or modify the payments

339
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,990
20 so you can buy stuff for free so
something which is often neglected armed

340
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:27,419
militias employees insider threats so if
you have good updates or Web

341
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,830
conflagration of database updates your
internal employees you also have to put

342
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,649
some controls in there you have to
ensure that someone is not just

343
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:39,610
inserting some malicious code ecosystem
because you say you trust all your

344
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,969
developers but bad news is 80% of the
attacks

345
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:53,220
happen by insiders rats ok so you should
consider debt so cryptography oh you had

346
00:31:53,220 --> 00:32:07,750
already had the Joker come up

347
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,280
it's ok just think he'd credit for
accessing in there now

348
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:21,040
external resources services and other
systems because they are stored in an

349
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,260
encrypted format

350
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:32,980
saved in the source code so where would
this happen here

351
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:40,790
well obviously one of your employees can
read the source code but I hope you're

352
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:46,620
not that dumb so you can still be dumb
enough to configuration and that have

353
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,419
arisen then then

354
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:57,200
well you could stop doing probably
exactly so please share passwords ok

355
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:19,620
even more don't use char yeah but yeah
Thank you very much

356
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:28,239
ok so quickly before we run out of time
cornucopia let's play one cornucopia of

357
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:43,370
cars who has a cornucopia card so you
unfortunately have to play it so this is

358
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:53,790
ranked number for Keith can perform an
action eg beauty so why would you do

359
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:03,840
this I'll let me tell you if you are ok
so again as I said consider insider

360
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,860
threat so if employees are allowed to do
privilege actions on your system that's

361
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:15,510
ok but has an audit logo of it have a
trace of all kinds of events that happen

362
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,960
who did it say if anything goes wrong

363
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,060
have a chance to look up where it came
from

364
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,429
if you cannot stop the attack anymore at
least be able to find out where it came

365
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:25,760
from

366
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,240
okay thank you very much for
participating in the game

367
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,549
let's go on because i dont have five
minutes left so normally what you would

368
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,940
do is during playing the game when
someone applies to threat to the system

369
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:45,620
then take notes in a note he would write
down which card this was brought down

370
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,020
who played the card so you can count
scores at the end and you will have

371
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,159
notes about this specific description
what the threat to US where it happened

372
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,990
what the causes and so now what I like
to do

373
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,270
and let's bring cam back to picture what
I like to do is to have a developer tool

374
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,030
these notes

375
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,580
why because I usually don't know the
names of all the people in the room he

376
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,110
does but apart from that I can be sure
that but he's taking notes is going to

377
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,100
write something down he's going to
understand he's going to write something

378
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,480
down that based on his system knowledge
and his decline technological knowledge

379
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,210
he can apply he can understand it's too
late to Roman to developers are looking

380
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,110
at it they're going to understand what
the spread is about it's not going to be

381
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,690
me

382
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:37,030
formalizing some strange texts so the
next step will be writing your threats

383
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,100
so what I usually do here is after we
had the discussion of the game

384
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:47,400
developers would uphold issues they've
written into the usual ticketing system

385
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,250
and then environment to meeting usually
like to have in the product owner like

386
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,980
to have some senior engineer or
development honoring that it's almost a

387
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,100
senior developer so not everyone has to
be in this meeting and what they're

388
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,250
going to do in there and why it's
important to have these people at one

389
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,560
table is because then you can really
assess the risk of the individual items

390
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:16,000
like going to be you as an outsider
saying well this is our issue because

391
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,390
it's has a higher probability perhaps
dunno if you have these people in their

392
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,390
product and I can tell you how many
customers do you have how important is

393
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,799
this feature it might be some way these
simple saying but if you have important

394
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,840
customers are using that feature is
going to get in high-risk item also

395
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,460
you're going to have to developers there
so they were going to tell you how

396
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:46,450
difficult it is to exploit that's right
or not so where can work with this but

397
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,000
of course account because you are
putting all the information his usual

398
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,100
ticketing system you're putting the
information into his usual workflow so

399
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,080
when he's leaving that meeting he
already have a prioritized list of

400
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,250
backlog items can immediately pick up he
has a description of the specific I

401
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,690
think he should be working on and if he
doesn't know what to do about it

402
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,800
you met him so many times that by now
he's going to come to you and going to

403
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,349
talk to and you are also going to

404
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:15,450
stand what happened because you were
involved in the whole process in know

405
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:22,999
what they were talking so summarizing we
compared to classical approach the

406
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:26,848
threat modeling to the game if I'd
approach but the question is what have

407
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:31,799
you looked so we learnt this is not a
threat modeling we've learned their

408
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:37,979
classic security engineers have no
methodology they absolutely at Hawk you

409
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:42,960
get no inside so better get someone from
the x-men team to do it you learn that

410
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,799
security engineers I was constantly
battling against developers

411
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:52,609
constantly bashing them what they did
wrong but this actually is not going to

412
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:59,499
cause any kind of improvement to the
security and is going to end up the

413
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:04,098
business like this so troubling can be
applied to everything and it's going to

414
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:10,400
work with everything but it's as good as
using a hammer to scoop you can do it

415
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,499
it's going to cause a lot of damage but
by the end you're going to have to screw

416
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:18,328
in that will so competitive games right
approach is going to bring everyone

417
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:18,950
together

418
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,779
everyone's going to get to know each
other raise awareness in the developers

419
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:28,369
into security engineers and have someone
stripped by the end of the meeting you

420
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:32,489
are going to have items which are
