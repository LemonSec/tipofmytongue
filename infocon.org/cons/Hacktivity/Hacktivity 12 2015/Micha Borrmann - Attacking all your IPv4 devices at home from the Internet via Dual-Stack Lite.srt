1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,179
hello i'm happy to be here in the past
and to be a bigger at activity 2015 and

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:15,219
I don't know what you know about this
topic maybe some of you have never heard

3
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:21,109
about before it will take light and I
hope you will learn about this kind of

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:28,880
access technology some information about
myself and my name is Michele Bachmann

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm from germany employed as a
penetration test on mostly I analyse web

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:45,430
applications company networks even talk
is based on real penetration test that's

7
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,010
the reason no company names and also no
specific issue will be addressed here

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:01:00,599
but I found some problems in space
technology and a reason for the talk

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:12,970
retarget bad internet access to
traditional internet acces you have a

10
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:19,310
router at home aren't devices are
connected to desirable it doesn't care

11
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:29,200
its cable wireless but this route to
call their customer premise equipment

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,450
CPE has publicly available ipv4 address
armed there's a small home network where

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:48,290
you have private ipv4 addresses usually
192 168 0 20 / 20 for instance this

14
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,950
route makes network address translation
for you every device can connect to the

15
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,600
internet but it's not possible to
connect from the internet to any of your

16
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,130
internal devices directly but you have
on most CPUs to possibility to configure

17
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,230
a so-called to port forwarding it means
one portrait for instance 8018

18
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,000
your route to internal demise and that's
the reason you can reach your network

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,209
attached storage which is located in
your home network outside from the

20
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,239
internet

21
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,140
mostly used in dan s for such things
armed i believe a lot of people have

22
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,399
sought kind of traditional internet
access at home please rate up your

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:43,930
friend who has a traditional internet
access at home fans expectation in the

24
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:53,790
future maybe only ipv6 one of the bigger
friends that every device has a rather

25
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,819
odd reachable ipv6 address from
everywhere Indonesian at from my point

26
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,798
of view

27
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:07,230
thoughts kind of internet access is not
available today or anybody here with

28
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:17,730
such kind of internet access I C one
hand you don't have ipv4

29
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,379
listen to our bod in the future

30
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:28,670
only ipv6 available and no I before
maybe some of you have internet access

31
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:39,379
this product for the main customer today
because a lot of services available with

32
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:52,179
ipv6 and you need ipv4 ipv6 is growing
and distributing more and more

33
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,959
couple of years ago there was a nice r/c
published RFC 6540 and it means ipv6

34
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,660
support this required for all IP couple
notes that's the reason I called recent

35
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,190
internet access were for dual stack then
you have ipv4 and ipv6

36
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,630
anybody who has such kind of internet
access at home ipv4 and ipv6

37
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:27,969
ok sam guide and for such kind of
internet access is providing more and

38
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,750
more I'm from germany and I expect we
have our days millions of clients with

39
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:42,280
such kind of in the next us to have a
preview for and ipv6 for ipv6 at the

40
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,940
same time I described before in general

41
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,039
every device as possible to connect
directly from the internet and four ipv4

42
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,280
the CPU works as a network address
translation route on like on a

43
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,530
traditional internet internet access
however the ipv4 address space explorer

44
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,419
Stewart the problem occurs ipv4
addresses are not available anymore

45
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:16,659
public ritual ipv4 addresses in Austria
and Germany summary I know five axis per

46
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,289
idols they are not able to provide you
with ipv4 address because they don't

47
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,909
have it

48
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:32,910
what can they do they are successful
they have a lot of customers we talk

49
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:40,170
about 100,000 or under trial isn't
clients of sea bees but no ipv4

50
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:46,870
addresses are available anymore texts
some solutions are appropriate area but

51
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,950
there's also a standard for us
understand I just called to the stake

52
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,300
light in contrast the full dual stack it
means I be reformed and ipv6 is

53
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:09,630
available on that line that is similar
but different and I will describe how is

54
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:17,270
this access technology working and what
current security you interesting things

55
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:29,820
related to it that's overview this CPU
is provided with ipv6 address from the

56
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,890
excess per item

57
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:40,900
armed for ipv6 no difference to a recent
internet access it means ipv6 is going

58
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,210
directly from the CPU to the internet
and in general all internal devices

59
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,700
which FIPB 6 address also in general

60
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,570
reachable from the internet maybe
doesn't firewall under CPE or something

61
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,560
like that but what happens

62
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:07,790
IPV for the most important difference
the CPE does not have a public available

63
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,700
IP fortress there is no ipv4 anymore

64
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:22,659
the device has externally only one ipv6
actress and configuration

65
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:32,830
it's called light its specified in RFC
6343 Desa important device on the side

66
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:42,979
of txs provide its called to address
family transitions are out of DA FDR

67
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:50,210
light enables access providers to share
ipv4 addresses among customers by

68
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:59,109
combining two well-known technologies it
means ipv4 and ipv6 here and there

69
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:11,050
called carrier-grade now at its da after
all they are distinct if you have access

70
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:19,480
to a satellite between ipv4 capital and
a so-called ipv4 provision do eyes on a

71
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:29,040
traditional or a recent internet access
to CPE was ipv4 capital flight route oh

72
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:41,360
this only ipv4 provisions doesn't have
public ipv4 address Monday but inside

73
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,740
internally they provide ipv4 addresses
for devices in your home network

74
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:57,550
yeah I do not talk about specific box in
a CPE which provides you with ipv4

75
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,250
address and I will also not talk about
box in specific FDR there are some

76
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,970
renders a provides devices for Texas
provide a means to a different FDR

77
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:17,570
Windows nowadays and different router
endows I have analyzed at least three or

78
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,000
four different CPU models from three
different rancorous

79
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,720
they are still on the market

80
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,150
technology from a user perspective

81
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:44,130
da FDR works for you like a proxy a
proxy for TCP or UDP and ICMP I think

82
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,990
some of you will provide services for
clients it means mail service we piensa

83
00:09:49,990 --> 00:10:07,080
resorts aren't important for you to FDR
all under market do not support IPSec

84
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:16,690
directly I know big companies in germany
come from that companies to have used us

85
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:23,070
to use the VPN connection with diapers
decade where they cannot use it anymore

86
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,180
because they have had homes are to do is
take light internet access but stay out

87
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,839
don't understand what happens here they
only called it's not possible to use the

88
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,980
VPN to our company I cannot work anymore
now that point that these gateways or

89
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:48,440
switch to do it means to VPN gateway has
to support ipv4 and ipv6 as well then

90
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,690
it's working because ipv6 can used
directly and most lines now a days have

91
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:04,900
ipv6 enabled it means maker as Windows
and Linux as the CPE doesn't have public

92
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,800
reachable ipv4 address anymore it's also
not possible to configure port

93
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,550
forwarding if you have network attached
storage in your home network which is

94
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,540
not supporting ipv6 and you have such
kind of internet access you can not use

95
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,930
this network attached storage from the
internet anymore there's no way you have

96
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:37,810
to enable ipv6 that may be important to
know if you have

97
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,329
an ass down and like two regions from
the internet but I've heard a second I

98
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,450
does not here in hungary present on the
market in Germany and Austria and

99
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,210
Germany I think also more than 100
million users have sought internet

100
00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:03,190
access I P for addresses are limited
because they are shared among our

101
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:10,310
customers quotes became a critical
crossroads well if you have ipv4 address

102
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:17,579
with maybe a thousand 2,000 5,000 people
to the same time you cannot have sixty

103
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,130
5636 ports for you

104
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:34,439
only less aren't how is it works as
designed to analyze it I wrote a very

105
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,060
simple PHP script but it's possible the
very programming language alike and put

106
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:49,479
it on a web server I request the youth
scripted only prints my source IP

107
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,920
address and my used source port become
an ipv4 Texas and also with a common

108
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,060
ipv6 access from home

109
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,510
device if that's only 12 eyes active

110
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:13,640
source ports are simple incremental is
the idea if you're under same script

111
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:23,890
with IPV 4 for Mac lined which is
accessed by a dualistic client

112
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:29,910
different pilots literature to hear what
you see

113
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:38,180
36,000 08 8363 nine and then the
connection is not possible the

114
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,109
connection is still active

115
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:48,370
reports I did a 100,000 tries the
currently

116
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,460
and id displayed at yeah that's
traditional symbol incremental it

117
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,230
depends on your operating system how is
it works and detailed hours no source

118
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:07,240
brought randomization hear about on the
usual operating system that simple

119
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:16,430
incremental if it's reached sixty 5656
it goes back to top off and start again

120
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:27,060
to increase with ipv6 and ipv4 with a
preview for us to think light it looks

121
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:37,260
totally different that's why aren't you
see here are some gaps that was seen the

122
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:50,339
connection was lost before armed zoom in
a little bit more deeper and attacked I

123
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:59,450
have four smaller ranges of ports which
was signed for me from my CPU which I

124
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:07,279
can use but they are blocked for limited
time and my allowed number of ports over

125
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,959
I cannot use any port anymore for
demonstration purposes I created a

126
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,339
website with a lot of pictures from
different wrap size and if all these

127
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,690
external resources come from different
IP before sites and I have exercised too

128
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:34,310
thick light the browser tries to connect
so already signed by Rd FDR and for

129
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,609
every request a new source portis cry
out but if the limit is reached reduced

130
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:51,080
configured on the FDR satellite pictures
will not display any more

131
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:57,870
house assignment of source ports that
was resolved

132
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,460
i've detected on 1 FTR what I can say is
nine months or sports it depends on the

133
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,770
bend or paved yard a different windows
and it kind of sore Sprott assignment is

134
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:17,730
different it's not the case that you
have four blocks in different phases it

135
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,680
also depends on the configuration of day
after all it's possible to configure

136
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,640
maybe taxes provide us signs a maximum
of 500 source ports for HDPE and it

137
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:39,699
depends on the film of the aft arm and
also on the load on the aft on these

138
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:47,140
devices access provider networks they
run about 40 gigabit per second or so

139
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:56,730
and believe there's a lot of traffic
I've seen one case there was a source

140
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:03,050
brought assigned to a client it means to
a CPU and less than one minute later the

141
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,448
same source port was assigned to another
CPU dramatic lined its dynamic depends

142
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:20,170
on the load off the FDR and window and
more than 5,000 people can share one

143
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:30,890
thing I P fortress that the fact it
works

144
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:38,300
and now there are some necessary task if
you provide services like Gmail service

145
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,540
enabling ipv6 especially for IPSec but
in general if you provide services

146
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,379
please provided also have ipv6 because
millions of people don't have I before

147
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,180
any more and also Texas provide or don't
like to pay for the FDR because costs

148
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,990
money and they don't have to do it if
ipv6 is available if people go to

149
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,480
Facebook to Google to YouTube for Tamil
all these sides are available

150
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:19,660
native ipv6 but other sides market point
us if you have IP for services increase

151
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:26,240
the number of current connections one
public override on Germany his paw print

152
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,830
server available only via IP before and
I know clients to have internet access

153
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,740
is down on to try to reach mail and get
a message too much current connections

154
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,020
from your IP address

155
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,330
yeah 5,000 connections from one IP
address it looks a little bit strange

156
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:56,220
but it's not malicious traffic its usual
traffic if the source IP address is

157
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:04,530
shared by maybe five present you with us
and if you have a preview for us about

158
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,170
you should enable source for blogging
death also are seen which is required

159
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:20,900
for sharing IP address is an example if
you see how to activate the source

160
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:28,750
brought looking very simple if you have
strange traffic and you like to identify

161
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:35,300
what was client you usually you need to
help of the police I think that the same

162
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:42,730
Casey and hungry but if the ipv4 address
the shouts for our customers the ipv4

163
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,190
address itself

164
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,929
not enough to identify the current
customers you need to source products

165
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:55,600
also because the FDR has extended
network address translation table

166
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:06,120
there's also the assignment between the
current source port and CPU well that's

167
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:13,439
all about forbes now you should have a
deeper look into tunneling ipv4 or ipv6

168
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:24,070
tunneling quite old from the 19th RFC
2474 and now it's more less two times

169
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,049
they are free you know they are free

170
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:35,649
therefore they are too but two times
slower free land and strange I have a

171
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:44,799
simple demonstration you can build a
scape you for instance and even this

172
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:52,580
next test or equal to 4 as not to good
documented what if you trade such

173
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,449
applicant

174
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:05,530
are prepared it here it means a source
address a destination address and ipv6

175
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:22,500
and the source and destination address
in if you showed a packet

176
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:36,770
IP that's what you expected and ipv6
both is later free but you have two

177
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:44,389
times they are free at this little bit
strange if you're anticipated up it's

178
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:50,940
the same you see ipv6 and ipv4 441
packet eyes in pleasure crafts and a

179
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,650
kiss how about Wireshark here

180
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:15,570
pachyderm you only thing I before
address if your filter for ipv6 you

181
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:27,610
should expect to see nothing wow there's
one here

182
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:37,389
is displayed in overview here only the
highest layer free packet not all and

183
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:46,980
here I have they are free ipv6 and above
or below depends on your point of view

184
00:22:46,980 --> 00:23:02,350
as I before and then the payload or lay
off its little bit strange if you the

185
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:08,830
address time to have two times they are
free and you can combine you can have a

186
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,210
layer for your free times four times for
them it's possible in general but it's a

187
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:25,490
little strange but those packages really
nice if you have seen these

188
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:35,980
understandable runs between europe CPE
and EFT are here is ipv4 tunneling over

189
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:49,370
ipv6 because Texas provide on has ipv6
only natural can have and on that way

190
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:59,120
this tunnel is active if your client and
you used to a sec light than you can

191
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,409
imagine your exes pride on cans the your
used private IP addresses because

192
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,940
they're out on does not work as network
address translation right anymore it's

193
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:16,840
done by the FDR because Eric carry out
great network address translation CTN is

194
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,629
used for it

195
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,200
and Texas provide or can you draw how
many DeWyze this my clients have in the

196
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,340
past and Germany contracts available

197
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,629
allowed to have only won two free
devices on your internet access that's

198
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:43,030
not the case anymore but maybe just a
contract which is limiting the number of

199
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,820
concurrent devices and now it's more
easy forex this provider to monitor how

200
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,220
many different sizes do you have a town
which private IP addresses to have

201
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,290
because all this information is possible
to see in the tunnel which aunt at the

202
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:11,030
FDR while this tunnel ipv4 or ipv6 what
do you think what kind of authentication

203
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:26,220
Tara available no answer that's right
there's no indication this was

204
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:33,650
interesting for me and I developed the
following attack it means I tried to

205
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:45,010
attack all ipv4 devices at home if you
have light internet acces as an attacker

206
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:57,710
into internet I should try to spoof the
FDR ipv6 address this unique reachable

207
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:07,310
public ipv4 address and found this
packard's to the CBE drought on the

208
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,990
route on

209
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:18,380
capsule a third and it results in a
preview for a normal IP four decades it

210
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,400
comes from the internet and send it to
her

211
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,260
device and home number maybe a printer

212
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:39,440
response goes to the CPU it sounded to
the FDR and ipv6 and ipv4 it sent to the

213
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,840
internet and reached from the attacker
but interesting point us you can have a

214
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:56,290
direct connection from the Internet to a
private IP fortress

215
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:03,440
running only under the presentation
slides here are running really well and

216
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:11,420
yes a small how-to for Linux it's quite
easy to perform it it's really hard to

217
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:20,330
hear ya after an able accounting module
four ipv4 and ipv6 tunneling then you

218
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:27,830
have to configure ipv6 address off TFT
are as an additional ipv6 address on

219
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:40,149
your system here this address of the FDR
the CPE knows this address this is

220
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:47,360
provided for instance with DRO 69
protocol or something like that

221
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,129
want a secret

222
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:01,090
then you have to define tunnel the label
no more private eye peas it's only label

223
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:10,740
you can use any name and you have to
establish this tunnel from your spoofed

224
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:20,620
IP address to ipv6 address of CPE of the
router at home because this tunnel is

225
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:31,080
without authentication and dateless when
you have to enable the tunnel after that

226
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:40,290
you have to enable routing to a private
to any used ipv4 network behind the CPE

227
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:46,200
mostly its 192 168 odone or something
different

228
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,870
mostly it's rendered appended and then
you have to send a pic introduced onto

229
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:58,560
private network entry p.m. only one
packaged it read some information from

230
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,690
NTP service and I run this program from
the system and the Internet

231
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:15,650
against a private IP address but request
timed out it doesn't work

232
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:21,789
sure working

233
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:34,019
you send a packet that way maybe NTP
service running the response goes that

234
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:42,070
way that right right right here it
should be received here the reason is

235
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:55,299
your eyepiece extended to 192 168 0 not
one but two responds Thomson that

236
00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:01,539
example from 18 to 21 22 23 and usually
your IP static

237
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:12,299
not recognize that stance on of my
request and also brought different the

238
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:20,590
easiest way to record the answer to the
real output not lifeguards captured on a

239
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:29,658
real system and you see here this answer
comes from the FDR ipv4 address to my IP

240
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:40,269
refer to us and all the continent can
just plate and a difference it's a

241
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:49,090
possibility to connect with a private
ipv4 address and home not rule out

242
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:56,500
having port forwarding or anything else

243
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:08,360
it works with UDP and ICMP ping on your
sites at home if you have time maybe you

244
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,629
can write a more defined IPV you poor
ipv6 stack which can detect packets

245
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,340
Majoris onto the same data stream which
they come from different source IP

246
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,260
address can you send packet to it should
be possible if you have time and maybe

247
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:33,670
then the new project for you it works
not with TCP directly at least a freer

248
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:42,210
and rank and FDR have integrated
stateful inspection firewall it means if

249
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,360
your stand here as soon

250
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,020
packard's to start a free rent rake this
device sent soon acknowledged packet to

251
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,650
the FDR pot stateful inspection firewall
here dropped his packet at Vermont come

252
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:08,850
that way but with European ICMP it works
fine with TCP you can have so-called

253
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:15,600
acknowledged scanning it means only
enact packard its sand through all FDR's

254
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:24,610
I've checked in the past what do you
need you need as an attack our system of

255
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,510
terrorist attack on the Internet

256
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,070
ok it's easier than usual

257
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:36,300
you need to ipv6 address after CPU from
Adelaide customer the different

258
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:46,450
difficult because how is this IP address
and use mostly users don't know down

259
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:55,200
ipv6 address of the CBE because if they
have outgoing ipv6 connection and take

260
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,840
go to a website like Hulu my breeze show
me my IP address date displayed ipv6

261
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,129
address of the device itself if they go
to ipv4 side

262
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,890
ipv4 address off to a few artists plate
the CPE ipv6 address

263
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:17,250
is more or less a secret but it's not so
called a secret you need to ipv6 address

264
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,700
after FDR

265
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,880
also simple because mostly all lines of
one access for I'd have to say if you

266
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:35,260
need IP address of the home network
that's easy to guess mostly and you need

267
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:47,700
to possibility to spoof ipv6 address
from the FDR against the CPU however how

268
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,590
is it possible to move it here this
attack is displayed as running from them

269
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,909
but that's not necessary

270
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:06,130
stateless one packets like UDP ICMP you
can send the spoofed ipv6 address even

271
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,810
if you are also a dual stick like lined
from the same access provider who

272
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,739
surrendered to another client of the
same access provider and a result cannot

273
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,310
go to you because you don't have a
public ipv4 address but you can send it

274
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,730
to ipv4 address which is under your
control and Internet

275
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,899
no possibility to detect this kind of
attack is trying to do the same thing

276
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:36,120
because one client to sending a strange
packet to another client in the same

277
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:46,149
access provider and a result goes to
anybody in the internet it's possible

278
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:51,828
well i records penetration tests are not
an attacker and my goal is to improve

279
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:59,470
security level and there are some
measurements if you are a customer who

280
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:05,980
has a stake light internet access do not
publish your ipv6 address of your CPE

281
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,289
because is the secret to only one secret
you have but it's not so called

282
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,250
authentication

283
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,470
only one secret and other point us
please protect all your devices in your

284
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:26,308
home network because even if you have
for instance a printer which is able to

285
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:32,059
reconfigure SNMP community string
private a lot of network printers can

286
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:38,200
what if I don't start relay and even if
this printer is not configured to use

287
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,160
the internet because yeltsin static IP
addressing home now track and it's only

288
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:52,629
reachable from your devices at home to
print on its cannot send it here because

289
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,410
no default gateway you can send only to
that

290
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:02,910
devices but such a packet can enter the
wise from the internet and SNMP

291
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:09,750
notifications only in one UDP packet
even if there's no default that gateway

292
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:15,890
on your printer it's possible to modify
it as an MPN because S&P second improves

293
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:24,190
security not my problem

294
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,670
if you access provider I can strongly
recommend to all access providers in a

295
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,470
blender spoofing measurements as much as
you can on the border rooting for BJP

296
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:45,209
also on every network device between
your CBS and the FDR and on devices

297
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,940
between our products provide an address
even some excess provide on also offer

298
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,810
dedicated virtual servers dedicated
original samples and there's no moving

299
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:01,970
protection between dees service and
client through access providing saw from

300
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:12,959
such as it's easy to moving attack
against these clients and lost and if

301
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,410
you're a CPU and RAM police protect your
log files because after CPE router us

302
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,420
looking for a firmware update and
downloaded in all these files

303
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,829
ipv6 addresses of the sea bees are
included though these log files are

304
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:37,880
important for attackers or they are
confidential

305
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:47,869
while my last point even for service
provider please enable ipv6 you may ask

306
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:55,190
why am i dont drawn IPSec service and
myself as only a simple TCP service like

307
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:02,180
mail or weapon and also all clients with
a satellite can use my service in

308
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:09,118
general that's true but what

309
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:18,289
happens if the payload off your
datagrams are very close to the maximum

310
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:29,670
transfer unit because the encapsulation
takes 40 additional bytes for ipv6 and

311
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:36,900
if you're serving huge fires uploading
videos for instance data packet size is

312
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,230
important

313
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:48,180
a small ICMP echo across doesn't care if
they are too big for dang capitulated

314
00:38:48,180 --> 00:39:00,049
tunnel will be fragmented here it means
here he comes ipv4 packet 1500 bytes

315
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:08,430
total size he owe it will become a
scythe of 1540 by the additional ipv6

316
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:15,788
header and Dan are fragmented on that
way and not fragmented on that train

317
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:23,740
under general if

318
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,240
fragmented it means the number of
placards is increased and the

319
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:35,669
performance decrease and I hope you
don't like slow performing service

320
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:44,020
that's the reason I strongly recommend
please enable ipv6 on your services

321
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,619
yeah that's all I can say is thank you
for your attention if you have questions

322
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:56,920
you can ask me here by mail if you like
me to be like security yeah thank you

323
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,320
for attention

324
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:08,890
residents here directly thank you
