1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:14,009
that doesn't make me $98 million not bad
for an autograph helicopter tour casali

2
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:25,419
follow us at all and I thought most
advanced tickets at a terrorist nation

3
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:41,469
palestinian committee issued a little
time it has a lot to request an

4
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:53,769
immaculate condition of the capital and
shambolic music which might otherwise

5
00:00:53,769 --> 00:01:06,480
have a macro economist at the more don
is godliness light of pasta pasta rice

6
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,440
summary

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,070
I'll talk about issues that you need to
pay attention to if you're developing

8
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:23,109
security related apps I'll also talk
about the mathematical background a bit

9
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,060
here in the post quantum cryptography I
agree you shouldn't forget that in the

10
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,240
past many years we have seen a lot
happening here in classical cryptography

11
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,160
you shouldn't forget the MDN 5 collusion

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:52,289
collision published about by profits 11
the first countermeasures reach only

13
00:01:52,290 --> 00:02:01,390
happened in 2012 it was used by the
appearance of flame which utilize every

14
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:11,980
five collisions generated obvious key
and certificate which could be used as

15
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:22,980
co-signing could then be used to sign
modified procedure delete every five

16
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,790
science

17
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,209
a bit since its stores you shouldn't
forget what happened

18
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:39,290
addition institutes the parallelization
described by random number generation

19
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:46,939
this is the topic off topography which
would hear about today by another

20
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:55,569
presenter and we should not forget about
the fact that it is very easy to

21
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:02,988
downgrade agree there was simply by
random number generators just think

22
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:09,280
about the fact that in 2006 there was a
modification in the OpenSSL which

23
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,250
affected his friend the Member regional
radar and it only became public

24
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,939
knowledge two years later one and a half
years later but do not go back so deep

25
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,138
in time even in a year ago

26
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:33,720
Android was found to have a similar
vulnerability and generations of yes or

27
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,220
so we need to be aware how these agree
there should be and is a textbook

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,270
example for this is it was provided by
the failover

29
00:03:47,270 --> 00:04:01,460
by the city for signing

30
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:11,020
develop problems or the background
liberia's until the value returned to

31
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,140
the random number was not a real now

32
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:34,700
random numbers so they could actually
bring serious settings where we have a

33
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,099
good quality the random number
generation and interviewed if you are

34
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:49,310
met he is checking or if the doubt this
then we said in our asset-based key

35
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,210
replacement

36
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:07,818
compromise then the kids access that all
traffic will we also shouldn't forget

37
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:13,470
how important for the holidays are we
have seen examples of that today

38
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:29,680
increasing the criteria required for
co-developed Aires so party's candidate

39
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:38,539
code based on that leaders such audit
was made on TrueCrypt last year we heard

40
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:58,990
that there are no problems with but it's
a simple story because and open source

41
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:09,860
solutions to problems of open shell
fisheries is over the source you use it

42
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,650
as a commodity devices as well

43
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,260
can be used to a lot of things but

44
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:57,700
generation is something that is ready to
head was the evidence snowden story

45
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:06,590
solutions to our problems here our
solutions use this and will encrypt and

46
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:18,630
decrypt great but if you look at these
applications we often saw calling the

47
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,960
same Microsoft API or the same OpenSSL
library or job experience class or

48
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:39,909
whatever they use the same class
implementation so in reality

49
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:47,330
foundations that lead to solve the
problem

50
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:58,599
appearing agreeable herds best of their
behavior or are also different from

51
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:12,270
classical classical and quantum we see
advertise themselves as having some sort

52
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:20,789
of want to architecture computer that it
is marketing we also see only that it's

53
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:30,320
probably not even a two-run single line
of code says 220 love and as we go see

54
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,159
co-operating with the company so we
still do not know what the real

55
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,209
situation is but we see one thing we
need to learn about this and will be to

56
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:45,010
know what to prepare for but we can see
nothing that we can be sure whether this

57
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:57,250
exists and if they don't when they will
exist if there will be on the computer

58
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:13,040
or published a very good description RSA
is dead deer season

59
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,800
elliptic curves are dead and I agree
with him instead so what do we have

60
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,800
instead of reasons

61
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,329
symmetric report if you will still there
are other medical problems we should get

62
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:46,570
based on that will work inside dead
deletions use for a prime factorization

63
00:09:46,570 --> 00:10:12,250
polynomial time algorithm is mentioned
in this respect

64
00:10:12,250 --> 00:11:22,440
but the general public absolutely safe
when I would however just to get this

65
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,220
office documents or PGP operation

66
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:54,170
something similar to what it means that
encryption scheme but this symmetry key

67
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:06,060
they sent you see it through the channel
or deposited in a civil action yet filed

68
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:15,430
one of these and wait a couple of years
and then you will get this stored value

69
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:23,540
into the computer and RSI protective
skin get them be decrypted and then

70
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:35,790
using this can decrypt the encrypted
data here thinks there's a perfect

71
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:50,529
forward secrecy this concept is about
the fact is compromised so when

72
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:58,180
he becomes public knowledge then what
happens

73
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,430
the the data can be decrypted to make it
more difficult for blackheads and

74
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:14,149
decrypted to make it based matching is
recommended where the client's browser

75
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:41,529
also generates secrets did we should
protect against is simpler to be good

76
00:13:41,529 --> 00:14:07,250
because these security related issue I
mentioned the shore algorithm

77
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:18,730
maths now a real them the modified
algorithm is able and a quarter of

78
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:29,430
Environment utilize positions and
parallelism so to a certain things not

79
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,760
in real time

80
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:45,220
the things to see reaches the shore of
these two parties but one of the largest

81
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:58,380
common divider and we have an aris a
modular so I would like to fight

82
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,439
tri-cities

83
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:12,900
random number is smaller than the small
users make it seven and on the arab sex

84
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:28,620
and this periodicity we see the
remaining period just repeating after

85
00:15:28,620 --> 00:16:04,460
fifteen steps so the period of the city
of this then you take the largest

86
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:37,440
dangerous

87
00:16:37,440 --> 00:17:17,579
tradition traditional computers the
level was 230 232 now we should be

88
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:26,780
restored after 128 now that we see what
the reasons are for our worries let's

89
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,160
look at what we doin choose them

90
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:41,670
summary and also sure that there are so
many good problems and agree with space

91
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,740
for them that will still be functioning

92
00:17:43,740 --> 00:18:05,120
example has basically this is what we
all have a look at it

93
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:44,449
number of times so I give you names like
the good news is that you can see

94
00:18:44,450 --> 00:19:00,390
matures we have problems as the basis of
an allegory of them better protected

95
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:10,900
difficult questions based problems can
only be used for creating I signatures

96
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,680
also called base like a real terms

97
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:23,690
error correcting codes these will
probably be preferred callous a writer I

98
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:32,390
agree that can be used both for
signatures for and got a few will be

99
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:39,070
super bowl

100
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:52,850
based on them can be found as scientific
obligations but they are not easily

101
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:02,158
accessible to a developer as yet so for
us what is important is to have them

102
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,059
about it is a standard only look at what
standards are already available sealed

103
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:18,559
the deal with it or not

104
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:28,779
shows that it started around 2013 14
2005 there was a senator's Asian tempted

105
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:36,630
in true but it died of any ideas

106
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:49,550
RFC dressed appeared primary dealt with
hash basic algorithms specify what I'd

107
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:58,129
like to mention is that decision but he
also set up a group although they

108
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:12,380
probably only a guideline they did not
specify any I agree yet and what needs

109
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:22,540
also to be mentioned is guidelines is
Jay Bernstein and his team the one hand

110
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:36,340
this and you level are about to issues
of recommendations for developers this

111
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,429
is a really new documentation you look
at it is totally current it was

112
00:21:40,430 --> 00:22:30,490
published on the 7th of September this
year as I have mentioned

113
00:22:30,490 --> 00:26:53,880
something good

114
00:26:53,880 --> 00:38:16,680
we have

115
00:38:16,680 --> 00:40:07,210
share with you and as far as I can tell
my time is up 24 the screenshots

116
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:07,890
down
