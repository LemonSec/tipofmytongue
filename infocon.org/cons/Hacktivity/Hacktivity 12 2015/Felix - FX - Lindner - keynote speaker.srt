1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
hello i'm effects I have the pleasure of
doing weird as talk for you so that

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:20,109
everything else after me looks and
sounds technical I was told I should say

3
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:27,820
something about me basically I don't
know why I'm getting keynotes but I like

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:41,440
giving them and just basically is about
why we do what we actually do which

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,039
usually looks like this during wanna do
that really wanna run systemd no you

6
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,010
don't

7
00:00:49,010 --> 00:01:01,010
so basically we used to do is playing
with computers with technology because

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:12,200
it's fun because it looks scary X then
everyone else decided to use technology

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,400
I mean I still don't understand why
people don't see work in a bakery

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,990
need to have a computer because it is I
think it was an MIT professor who said

11
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,039
i'm not in computer science because I
like computers and computer science

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,220
because I want to keep an eye on those
fuckers and is very true for me as well

13
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:47,930
and I also like being told what I do
with my technology so we have a lot of

14
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:54,700
money for a piece of technology I don't
want someone else to tell me what to do

15
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,240
see this is what happens

16
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,520
you're nice to one side or the other

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:19,810
this is a context coded you so so does
that work of course unlike yes takes

18
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:32,540
ages so basically I'm running but let me
rephrase sent my best friend runs a

19
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,709
company called recruiting labs we do
security consulting higher security

20
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,930
grounds are in one of my they call
themselves smokes is also presented here

21
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:53,510
so we basically get to see a lot of
stuff in the industry we test all kinds

22
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,870
of computer systems that are usually in
things that are not meant to be computer

23
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:08,459
systems aircraft medical devices cars
that type of thing and we buy we do a

24
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:16,739
lot of research internal research some
of which now turned into a company where

25
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,200
basically we're teaching computers to
trust like humans because you know

26
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:34,410
computers those days basically trust you
for everything right in Islam has to

27
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,010
sort of figured checks out your good
this is a banking website you only

28
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,670
wanted to make sure it's your bank now
it can actually install software on your

29
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,190
computer and do all kinds of things I
mean and this is not how you once worked

30
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,090
in german trust also does not help do
you concept of revocation

31
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,750
because if I stop trusting you are not
running around the world telling 803

32
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,410
billion people did so we're actually
telling them that I have a file that you

33
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:13,940
can download which then tells you did I
did so and in my spare time of which I

34
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,029
have very little I never went to the
military and and you know next thing you

35
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,549
know I turned out to be a need or
director for the military mission that

36
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,880
they do because securing computers is so
easy you know I took up the task to

37
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,840
secure an entire country which is the
country of Jordan so I usually don't do

38
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,599
that but they asked me to be confused
and I keep looking at the slight I

39
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,060
finished them your own state so what is
happening what are we actually do right

40
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:09,289
words everyone else in the world thanks
to the video games you know it's the

41
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:16,950
evil people with the ski mask you know
that sit in front of a computer because

42
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:23,500
I'm a white house so I don't see how
that say what it takes to wear scheme

43
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,460
out I figured

44
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:49,159
that's how i hack I guess yes sir that's
the Whitehead ski mask great is this war

45
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:59,860
is a possibly the term referring to
people in the MIT light rain club that

46
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,289
actually managed to run a bunch of
trains without smashing them into the

47
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:11,630
other trains that's actually were drunk
comes from because if you ever ran a toy

48
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:19,259
train system and you will know those
little keys to open to have them

49
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:33,050
permanent work longer in this is the
term happy because thats to sound so the

50
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:40,440
third possible way is well maybe you are
great hacker if you managed to burn

51
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:49,979
material did you actually have sworn
about 50 routes to protect burn it on a

52
00:06:49,979 --> 00:07:00,750
CD label Lady Gaga walk out of it and it
wouldn't be the only person flies around

53
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:09,800
the world without a passport that in my
way in my world is not hacking use you

54
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,270
know there's a definition of
whistleblowing and it does not involve

55
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,580
you being illegal it involves the other
party being illegal

56
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,620
oneself is hacking

57
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,610
not giving a shit is

58
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:35,919
today it's actually up to you whatever
it is is up to you however be prepared

59
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:43,409
to live up to the consequences of the
choice you made because this is no

60
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:51,840
longer just about you it used to be when
we had a means to us and you do so

61
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,039
simple tasks in a responsibility but in
a connected world and would you do with

62
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:08,990
it is actually affecting a lot of people
and this also changes the perception of

63
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:19,919
who cares about what you think your
friends what about your friends can use

64
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:29,169
to be obscure meaning no matter how hard
do you are skilled compared to your

65
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:39,039
friends your cool yes why I started
being skilled I kind of failed will but

66
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:48,149
being argued I did was then later a
little bit about shame which is fine as

67
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:56,500
long as that is in your your friends
circle then suddenly FEM equal money I

68
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,360
mean look at the loft became at state
and was bought by Symantec and stuff

69
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,670
like that i mean we're talking about the
hacker group that was bought by Symantec

70
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:17,540
I mean people they can't do security if
it bites Germany yet nowadays it's

71
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,459
competition so suddenly your friends are
your competitors how about your employer

72
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,670
if you have an employer that actually is
smart enough to have a internal security

73
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:34,300
team we're not here to listen to it
almost never happens

74
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:48,689
your risk to your employers job so in my
work with nato for example I realized

75
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:55,880
the military almost every ever does pen
test squander all networks simply

76
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,330
because there's two cases cases one day
in general will house a very bad gut

77
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:09,250
feeling about the security of their
networks and suddenly something

78
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,680
unexpected happens with jizz they've
finally noticed that they help someone

79
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,229
else and then there's two types of
organizations in the world those that

80
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:25,980
got hacked into Austin to notice in what
happens to him as he goes in front of

81
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:34,800
the camera media angles in the other
case is he had a penchant for any hassle

82
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,209
to bunch of paper on his dad's playing
music and you need to do this and that

83
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:45,530
and then they get hacked very bad for
the crew year you're going to pension so

84
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,370
basically every pen test is killed by
the highest possible general but his

85
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:59,130
support in its cool before it happens so
wheelchairs your plans let's say you're

86
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:07,960
self-employed used to be quite unique
needed to tell people why did actually

87
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:17,170
need to hire in nowadays in once you're
done and let's assume you're done let's

88
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:26,959
assume you don't completely suck in need
to report free refer open referrer URLs

89
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,630
in your report because it didn't find
anything else like the backdoor

90
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,640
passwords that are all over to coat

91
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,100
you're reducing everyone's but let's
just now they have to do something to

92
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,870
spend money on security which means
there is less profit which means to

93
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:52,520
getting bonuses I mean guess how why
everyone is putting runners internet

94
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,069
works because you have to go to the CEO
and tell him that he gets a couple

95
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,870
billion Celeste bonus per year just
because you're having a bad gut feeling

96
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,390
about it by means of Chinese people
would drop rotation time of a couple of

97
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,580
weeks writing the code of hours he
doesn't even know what about the others

98
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:30,990
and it was a unique resource for while
the government's called in as a now I

99
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:38,040
mean basically it became a commodity in
the commodity got a price check because

100
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,740
every military in the world and
everything in the world really wants to

101
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,730
help all day and it happens to be the
case that they all 12 have voted against

102
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:57,910
the same target for example so basically
you turned out to be a very inefficient

103
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:07,439
a quality program either you get paid
for doing homework when you get paid for

104
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:16,450
the box to say about what happened with
dad is dead for disclosure died thats

105
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,180
the first victim basic is interesting

106
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:30,010
also demeaning this but I mean keep in
mind devoted as much trolls as for

107
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:37,689
Chancellor speed but he only traded
managed to piss off everyone including

108
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,220
the people running it 2d extended to
shut down the meaning this was someone

109
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,860
who did not understand that he had to
call buck into fucking vendor didn't pay

110
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:56,570
my background and drug wasn't even cool
in fact it wasn't even a book that

111
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,580
pissed off people's so much to people
stop hacking because of something like

112
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,340
that I mean it is silly

113
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,300
the reason and full disclosure I used to
exist

114
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:17,609
yes by the way the whole reason that
we're having this conference here the

115
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,050
whole reason that we actually have of
the issues that we're dealing with

116
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,010
because for disclosure existed to shame

117
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:38,240
vendors into fixing shit day it when you
say you had a Solaris server and you

118
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,730
actually managed to get it working and
then some

119
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,820
basically locked in our lock-in because
doesn't add service didn't take a

120
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,620
password

121
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:55,650
price in India reported that had to sign
a paying customer mind you and you're

122
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,720
like so functionality issue no

123
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,300
functionalities they're good and in
order to tell people what do problem is

124
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,620
so they could fix it actually happened
to publish it which is you know running

125
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,800
the risk of that bad guys also know
about that

126
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,000
course and then systems

127
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,340
updated but that many to get updated
quickly it because if you're not

128
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,500
updating the system you know the bad
guys know about the vulnerability they

129
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:43,210
had you blah just became compliance so
it out for everyone that works in the

130
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:52,300
corporate world compliance is usually
the opposite of security and spend your

131
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:59,500
money on taking the right check boxes
and money or not needing the check boxes

132
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:11,170
because you actually understand and a
bill T does not exist

133
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:21,680
nowadays if anyone heard of our regular
i mean two things this will be in

134
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:30,459
today's world because there's so many
are there is a PR problem if it doesn't

135
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,690
hit the press it's not a problem because
the compliance people will not know

136
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:42,270
about it so there's not a checkbox for
it and you know his pants because the

137
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:49,110
companies mentioned in the evening news
this is where everything winds that is

138
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:55,600
the reason why the United States changed
the entire international cyber policy

139
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,400
differs things like that today that used
to be well as we just get and if it was

140
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,370
a proxy that for the proxy they changed
it

141
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:18,589
200 let's control the arms what arms the
arms would damien is one abilities in

142
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:25,230
the idea of that comes from the obvious
that I suspect to be basically paid by

143
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,760
Apple and our record because if it's
controlled arms which it happens to be

144
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,480
now so the green

145
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,080
and arrangement which is basically
defining what a weapon is that is

146
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,030
controlled worldwide you know it
contains cards that you used to build

147
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,860
nuclear bombs and stuff like that

148
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:56,959
also has a section on dual use of a
weapon it's in that is very practical

149
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,970
for people that considerable abilities a
PR problem because now basically do

150
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,090
short of it is I can call any country
that is another writer of devising

151
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:16,168
arrangement which is most of them and go
arrest this guy and in a whole and not

152
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:21,950
let him out for the rest of his life
because he brought to jailbreak thank

153
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,010
you

154
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:31,750
so this is what happens if we don't pay
attention to how we are perceived from

155
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,380
the other side of the table which is
there as well you deliver if any is more

156
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,580
problems you know you're affecting real
people

157
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,980
iPhones that is you know that is general
discussions on mailing list is angry

158
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:58,530
Birds Eye happens on facebook hack
facebook this is how most people and she

159
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:08,510
received from what we do in computer
security so basically welcome to the

160
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:17,129
dark ages of hacking and so please bring
your criminal record and a couple of

161
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:24,000
fingers to do have left so we can print
them in your set-up certification for

162
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,080
his success as a clown incapable of
system or software protection also known

163
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,320
as CSS which I have

164
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:44,600
if anyone has ever done a CISSP
certification do you know what I mean

165
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:57,100
how did that come to that either because
we're not creative were because William

166
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:04,360
and I guess the second so did you
different issue of human and animal

167
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:12,240
house consciousness and ordered to be
driven by two things few and greet not

168
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:20,830
necessarily in this order so it's
basically dishwasher oven right and so

169
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,800
because everyone has different
understanding of feeling aggrieved what

170
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:37,649
we do is we have that of the lesser evil
social law and common denominator is

171
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:45,820
what comes out of it that is what we are
facing today is basically witchcraft so

172
00:20:45,820 --> 00:21:04,830
you know when your head is you can do
you have you learnt witchcraft in school

173
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:20,949
fires all of the known anything about it
plus a couple of other people did what

174
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:27,960
we call the Dark Ages medieval times
frayed I mean basic D-day was a couple

175
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:40,490
of hundred years old drilling session in
the Walt nothing out so terrible

176
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:49,669
barbecues it was sometimes about
knowledge but not always a good thing

177
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:58,130
yes we're doing the same right now in it
is even understandable why people do

178
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,529
that because they have no damn idea
would security and hacking actually

179
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:10,549
about the only one employee would arrive
at a bank in a medieval days the

180
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:17,720
slightest idea how do you know fight to
play kick not sixty percent of the

181
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,350
people around you dying because your
idea was maybe we should not listed at

182
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:37,779
first on the stake do you go really hard
around your ass not in the way we wanted

183
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:45,559
to daylight as a general idea how to
reach you once were suppressed fever

184
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:53,279
because you actually knew a couple of
plans on the body and then suddenly goes

185
00:22:53,279 --> 00:23:03,809
down which is very similar to how you
have an idea that the firewall sucks it

186
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,600
is not providing security burn

187
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,379
goes it all

188
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:14,720
it's the same thing you have no idea how
to keep mother in trying to live when

189
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:25,880
birth doesn't go well today known as the
house of cards against God burned very

190
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:37,600
similar to help out absolutely the same
thing yeah and don't even get started on

191
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,500
in a little knowledge which means yes I
don't need to source code to read your

192
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:55,550
code because that's called and yes I
considered stupid so what we are told we

193
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:01,639
were told by industries for example is
we have cyber indictment rent we don't

194
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,820
bring people on a state anymore

195
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,550
simply because our social media experts
tell us it would look bad on Twitter

196
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:17,780
Follow me on Facebook is basically my
name on the toilet

197
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:29,160
okay now let's talk test and we're just
a tech come from actually you know in

198
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,930
tracked all the technology

199
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:40,750
mourners invented by hackers in people
are sometimes unintentionally hackers to

200
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:51,240
browner's lead admits to a real ice to
her when I went to the mig enter the toy

201
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:00,160
train club you know that was after you
came up with the stupid I know it has

202
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,920
lost weight but exciting he called it

203
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,580
when he proposed what we call the web
now just a good idea is the part where

204
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:19,530
it says web app that was not him so
short story already running out of time

205
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:27,639
international policy so I'm sitting in a
room with a lot of great diplomats did

206
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,900
you say about the international policies
of most leading European countries in

207
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:44,890
terms of computer security and hacking
and all that and other advisers are and

208
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:56,770
I'm hobbyist I'm the only one that does
so like before regulating all that stuff

209
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,340
you might actually want to talk to the
people that run the Internet in a senior

210
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:15,270
British official response why we already
did wait did you know I am sure he looks

211
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,560
at me I'm so pleased to say we talked to
all four of them

212
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:31,940
ok which 40 mph understand the question
Microsoft makes the operating system

213
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:38,740
Google makes Ridge Facebook make social
and semantic make security that is how

214
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,820
international policy works today right
so just to get the idea why people get

215
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:54,340
on a stage for knowing what up coat to
basically do some good prepares to post

216
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:04,120
ww2 technology it was absolutely evil
technology when a bunch of absolutely

217
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,189
evil people used to it which yes nazis
where

218
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,820
but the moment you win

219
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:19,250
everyone else to get a technology I mean
look at just base raise rates the space

220
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:26,000
race basically begin 1945 where people
didn't bennett it raised through the

221
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,769
americans because they didn't want to
live with the russians the russians

222
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:37,159
raised in to get the technology was
burned by the Americans are so there is

223
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,529
a lot of technology that was really good
and really cool or something because

224
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:55,279
there was no longer in use the extent of
his money toward nope

225
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:03,409
so the Starwood again disease try to sum
it up shortly

226
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:08,210
they help the right technology already
it was called set

227
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,120
wrecked so and analysts caught only
access data relevant to that house blah

228
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,949
blah blah in a judge head out she drew
sign it off in to sign it also meant to

229
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,730
actually provide the secret key to a
public key today used for recording so

230
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:37,360
what then do something he was a budget
for a new interception system and those

231
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,699
budgets don't fall of the sky those
budgets come from lobbyists from defense

232
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:54,529
industry to get the budget but in the
end as a technician peoples were done on

233
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:59,870
a million to roll it out one way that
would be nice to budget was $2 billion

234
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:05,770
so it was cancelled

235
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,710
because it was too cheap because the
defense contractor world's not get a

236
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,980
defense contract because it was already
done so it was killed and another was

237
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:23,380
that the defense contractor got to be
defense contractors in a building on

238
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,860
that never worked then there was 2006
when people click the Run MySpace and

239
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:38,209
download lots of porn and yet as a head
into a problem in so basically if you're

240
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:45,700
the world's largest signal intelligence
agency and you want to see intelligence

241
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,920
that looks back I mean keep in mind

242
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,660
United States military did Department of
Defense do research on the internet had

243
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,440
engineered build had rolled out and let
us play with it now they want it back

244
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,550
right so it is really really hard for an
NSA to argue did they contact you listen

245
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:15,200
to everyone so what could they do
basically they copied Google because

246
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,370
Google already is a global signal
intelligence agency the good thing is

247
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:29,659
the entertainers love in its
intelligence analysts is interested in

248
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:37,200
intelligence about a certain female and
not supposed to be this happened about

249
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:46,160
three hundred times a year where three
hundred cases the thing is though so

250
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,730
people did our screen but military did
take polygraph tests and stuff like that

251
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,480
right

252
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:02,570
google has a higher coverage so they
actually surpassed intake only like two

253
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:08,270
years ago and that just boot small
margin google has a higher coverage and

254
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:13,480
the chief security officer closing
stages INS's never happened to Google

255
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,650
ever

256
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:22,850
ur sure do you know how MapReduce works
every interned can carry a member do

257
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:31,490
carry into the network and ders Crary
domains and one is called gmail never

258
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:40,820
how birds no I mean when I look at them
I can understand you nobody has

259
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:49,800
girlfriends in this company but get my
ass

260
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:58,649
this is what they make money with needs
a task someone needs to tell them get

261
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:06,760
intelligence on XYZ set Google makes
money with such percent of your income

262
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,600
that's why I think forty three billion
euro

263
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,070
George viewer rare element if the
service is free order product I think

264
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,649
that is clear

265
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:33,230
facebook facebook if you don't like when
you when you sniff on a network Facebook

266
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,440
stores every single packet that ever
reaches or exits their network since

267
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:50,080
forever forever area that is funny and
you're not of his choosing which I'm not

268
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,779
but they actually do that now I wonder
where Facebook snowden is right i mean

269
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:06,539
the one guy is what we can tell them to
not do it when we take away their

270
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:12,100
infrastructure they take all their
budget from informants which is not

271
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,539
tracked code ruined by the profiles I
run to help them do it so we can still

272
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:25,669
regularly on the topic of regulation
when people made roads today have no

273
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:30,600
understanding of how the computer stuff
works so fucking hairy monkey balls

274
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:43,260
since people have not understood what
what happened we also get health care

275
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:51,100
even if you like knights and shit
medieval times really truly suck because

276
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,658
there's no good restauranteurs no health
care whatsoever

277
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:02,539
health care basically leading you know
what bleeding is right you believe for a

278
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,860
while because that just against evil
spirits what actually happened and more

279
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,060
scientific

280
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:15,549
is basically it work twice because
people have let's say a former blood

281
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:22,700
poisoning ok it had worked twice we do
it always uses would we do in computer

282
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:30,428
security today it's called it an
antivirus no really I mean it was made

283
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:38,240
final because these people are you there
is little things like animals but

284
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:46,520
smaller in May people's invisible things

285
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,060
in all he wanted was that it was
nerve-racking hands between two

286
00:34:52,060 --> 00:35:01,060
surgeries because the fact the nation
with the first everyone knows that I'm

287
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,049
talking about bacteria

288
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:11,970
the same what we do two day touring
machines and decidability week we can

289
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:22,230
trust everything the regular expression
is I have people running the biggest

290
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:31,860
data centers in a European country
between between Germany and England

291
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:39,620
germans only go on trips to the center
after a Pinterest telling me we're fine

292
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,170
we're just the sequence action thing we
and across a scripting yeah we turn both

293
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:56,400
off so just exactly where we have right
and what happens in general nobody knows

294
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,960
how to even judge if it is correct right
how does a normal person is supposed to

295
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:13,140
know whether your security work is solid
or not damn good security guy then

296
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,810
nobody knows about you if you suck 20
knows about you quite quickly so that is

297
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,529
a problem so basically what happens in a
market where does a lot more in demand

298
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,840
and supply you get a lot of Charlton's
get a lot of people do you don't just

299
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:38,230
talk because they make money would be
even sometimes that no better and we

300
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,830
also have an equivalent

301
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:47,700
world by the way the only person is
allowed to say cyber without looking

302
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,129
stupid is william gibson

303
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,810
it's a drinking game when you say cyber
you need to drink

304
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:06,100
actually rendered on panels and
conferences that is quite back some big

305
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:14,930
city we have the security issues that
hit to news viewers worldwide our

306
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,339
security is use by people that actually
know better

307
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:26,860
published in basically is you know what
if you can use the functionality of a

308
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,360
network you know there's a network to
provide certain type of functionality

309
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,630
you can use that type of functionality
that makes you a system integrator not a

310
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:50,790
hacker even if the network has wheels so
how about not being already connected if

311
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:56,330
you're heading up all my network about
not having s 07 connection if you're

312
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,810
using that damn functionality where is
the security risk there's five thousand

313
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:07,620
other security risks sitting right next
to you but they don't make the news you

314
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,720
need to know people need to understand
but the best part about medieval

315
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,459
healthcare is potions rate in holy
stones and other stuff to put up your

316
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:32,760
ass to you know get better we have to
have a lot of it and we using it now

317
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:42,220
ideas isn't will never be the guy who
invented computers called Elementary has

318
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,669
proven why

319
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:54,010
huddling problem it is not possible
ideas isn't by the way I P o's want

320
00:38:54,010 --> 00:39:04,400
but every single military team that I
know concentrates their word on Park

321
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,010
finding and exploiting writing on June
thinks one of them as IPS because also

322
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:15,660
so a secure server is a machine that
speeds one protocol provides the

323
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:24,089
functionality of the protocol to you and
Dan does not crash when someone sends

324
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:31,440
the data from packets were stopped how
many secure servers have you seen

325
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:41,820
written just maybe raise your hand and
told me to go would yeah it's ok so we

326
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:52,120
can get secure servers now the idea is
to protect does that does not right we

327
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,470
take not one but two thousand five
hundred partners in E

328
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:04,310
absolutely not managed predicted
language see written in the current

329
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:12,040
space of course because it needs to be
fast and we put it right on a path

330
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:19,130
between the bad guy in our asset that's
gonna make it better

331
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:29,430
right for the other side the movie from
the eighties

332
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:41,339
if you want to go into the front door to
front door because the front garden 2500

333
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:49,860
locks don't take he's i mean you know
you can just put your finger and

334
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,320
comment

335
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:03,350
antivirus industry has not managed in
the guest clearly did will never managed

336
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:16,560
to even agree on the name of the virus
right and try it I mean look it up so

337
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:26,970
how do you what is bad question the
halting problem dictates that we can

338
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:35,359
tell whether it ever stop not when but
ever stop if we can't even tell if its

339
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:46,300
top so we can tell the truth that first
and been invented the computer so

340
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,570
basically those who don't understand
computers are condemned to reinvent them

341
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,510
all the time

342
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,480
poorly and get quote

343
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:05,810
nice example for not getting it isn't
that cool the United States Secret

344
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:16,470
Service over 6,000 people over 18
billion budget primarily for the reason

345
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:26,439
to protect the president which includes
his current location right and well then

346
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:34,560
he chooses to wear a Fitbit watch so
basically knowing where to president is

347
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:42,430
knowing when he sleeps or is educated or
whatever cost you as much as heck in a

348
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:50,460
fucking hipsters San Francisco company
that truly has protected their mouths

349
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,550
over the don't even know what a cloud is

350
00:42:53,550 --> 00:43:08,320
very very well that's priceless and
basically shut down to a bday by $54

351
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:19,780
billion I don't know your family another
I thought I didn't have enough material

352
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:28,090
now I have one minute presentation so
I'm coming up to present issues instead

353
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:33,450
of giving it to you i'm happy to give it
a styled to you

354
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:40,390
we'd run oldsmar conference that is
basically speak only conference and

355
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:46,299
everyone has to bring everyone has to
bring material for 15 minutes and you

356
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,600
presented on request someone else walks
up to you so I offered to prevent

357
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,250
tonight after party if you if you want
to see that the summary of diet is

358
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:04,360
everyone in the world spends a lot of
money and thoughts on oh my god when we

359
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,080
have quantum computers everything
computes imperil oh we can break our

360
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,990
assay in an instant and they tried to
build those computers the United States

361
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:26,100
a metric shitton money on it and it
turns out that during a nice private

362
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:34,610
evening with my partner she happens to
be a biologist and we were discussing to

363
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:42,130
incompleteness in so we have a formal
proof of deterring completeness of life

364
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:50,940
meaning a cell in a DNA it happens to be
a TV for universal Turing machine which

365
00:44:50,940 --> 00:45:02,050
requires a infinite tame and life is as
it turns out only know one universal

366
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,900
Turing machine which by the way even to
earn thought

367
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:11,740
existing we need to think he's
consistent out of it and all the

368
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,709
generals did spend all the money

369
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,550
quantum computers because they don't
they have South itself a better and

370
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:26,630
faster at it that's your problem and
this is basically what I'm trying to get

371
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:35,310
it is trying to get it try to understand
what we're doing here because you can

372
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:40,779
only explain things in simple terms to
people

373
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:46,640
computer insurance if you have really
really understood it because I always do

374
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,379
any garb repudiating wisdom from people
they usually have their own agenda

375
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:02,410
interest in you know a price check for
the next yellow box that you put

376
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:10,490
somewhere to make it secure where Biden
makes it difficult and whatnot so not

377
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:17,589
giving a presentation template that's
the final when you're just finished when

378
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,930
you finish your talk basic did the
moment you give it you have no idea how

379
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:28,069
long and bring to a sub basically

380
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:36,930
solutions though using offered by Penn
toasters and lots of interesting we do

381
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:42,660
security hot as you know I'm not
excluding myself but especially the

382
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:49,049
solutions ordered by the security
industry suck hairy monkey farts because

383
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:54,840
you just at a more broken coat to
quality barcode how solid numbers on

384
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,390
that equality of security software only
software in the world that is worse as

385
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,620
customer canceled for because even less
about their customers didn't care about

386
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:13,060
computer security equality of something
like Microsoft war it is about 30

387
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,190
percent better

388
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:19,290
usual juicy X instead of a checkpoint
firewall to protect your network what

389
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:31,520
the fuck security measures do it if
someone else how about we called

390
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,310
connects to that you answers yeah why
not the answer will be why do you know

391
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:46,110
do you use network connections would use
the amount of countries that you put

392
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:53,910
into stuff we haven't figured out how to
build a computer yet all the ones you're

393
00:47:53,910 --> 00:48:00,839
putting in our jail for not secure
computers in this is composition

394
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:08,230
just extrapolating the problem to the
max into solutions mean you're putting

395
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:17,440
more computers so you're fixing broken
shipment with more broken no just also

396
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,000
availability matters I mean I i've seen

397
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
manufacturing lines

398
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,650
controlled by one

399
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:46,050
its core 112 anyway I've seen any
fracture lines for automotive industry

400
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:51,990
for cars they started to actually kill
people instead of welding the doors on

401
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:58,029
the car and went too far in the other
direction almost killed two workers why

402
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:07,320
because some smart us how we have to put
a firewall in there is something like

403
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,900
packard runtimes you know there is
something like traffic delays in the

404
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,430
problem

405
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:21,680
industrial control systems do not like
300 milliseconds later availability

406
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,640
matters so I understand what you're
doing

407
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:35,379
manageability matters anyone has an SSL
certificate to you or password

408
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:44,870
incidentally we need to out any caters
to power grid people you know

409
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:51,700
roll out of power grid control secure
with X 509 certificates would just to

410
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,580
drop by itself but maybe buy it from you
know a certificate authority did your

411
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,210
browser knows because the power grid
needs to care about your browser right

412
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:10,030
there without realizing that for
companies control need six percent of

413
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:21,460
all SSL certificates and walled then
rolling out in to expire and your whole

414
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,300
civilization with it at least power grid

415
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:34,760
manageability matters matters if your
security measure cannot say what it can

416
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:45,170
and cannot do believe police it is not
one might ask me later about a project

417
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:53,520
in a win's did we're a very nice
friendly government agency into really

418
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:00,140
nice and friendly house to simple
question how to enterprise work gonna go

419
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:06,080
find out and I talk to people and I
disassembled coat and that is a whole

420
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,470
nother talk but you can ask people and
that's what a party is for right

421
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:19,740
basically getting it matters because our
society depends on all this shit now if

422
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:25,669
we want or not get real reward matters
time to live up to it

423
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,700
thank you very much
