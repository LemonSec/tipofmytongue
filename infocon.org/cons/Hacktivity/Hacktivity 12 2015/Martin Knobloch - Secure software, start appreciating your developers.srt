1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
it's not actually I did attend those
conferences but I'm not bashing each

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,440
other but I have to develop myself
actually just talked him up because we

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,329
did God we're very crampy every time
everybody is special to developers they

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,009
do it alone that congress you I got fed
up with it because I wasn't afraid of

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,859
hostility better but I had to the split
in developing and security event

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,769
security but my heart is still for
developers and then when you see the

7
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:36,750
best it hurts when they grow up so I
wasn't the current renters who called

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,710
people as risk of assassination and I'm
long haired guy with a beard and the

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,129
lady next to me like decent people
didn't start bashing developers I want

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:52,030
her getting angry at him again but
that's what is talk about it because if

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,199
they wouldn't go be no develop us we
would have not a lot of stuff we would

12
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:03,579
have so actually my ancestry overcome
from is completed difference I don't

13
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:11,439
have a night I T history I didn't study
I was 17 and other things to do and also

14
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,919
trained mechanic injection molding
injection morally it's very heavy iron

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,020
molds to be close but a machine liquid
plastic were being checked it cause it

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,449
opens the parts will be retrieved by am
guilty programmed robot sometimes even

17
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,150
though will be in alaska robot robot arm
removed from the mall mall closes and

18
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:41,400
again presumably because its mass
production timings range both expensive

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:51,240
so the first I can produce a productive
though I was a mechanic greasemonkey

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,640
widely hands and was really great
because we did sold a million little

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,290
aches with a dramatic hydraulics and
about as robots and I like and sounds

22
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,659
like things like moving by himself
apparently so I like a robot I very

23
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,960
quickly become responsible will keep the
rebels running of a you have her

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,980
time in mind that there's a problem
because you want to save time do you

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,440
send the robot arm into towards the mall
before the mall has open and you close

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,690
in the mall before the over has left
them all there's a slight problem

27
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:33,200
timing what if what if the money is not
opening the robotic arm into the mall

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,399
reporting unbroken expensive but it's
really funny and in president if the

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,950
mall closing and relatives still in
there and have a given but then neither

30
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,910
defendant he was the development so I
was a greasemonkey he wants to develop

31
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:59,340
the robot arm will be screened by the
mall he comes down and I blaming the use

32
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,920
or what have you done this type I could
stand it should not be possible I like

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,799
logic and certainly possible that this
is what I did I let myself be a TV

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,810
programming and download the letter
diagram twenty compiling and reading

35
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:25,420
head I hold a really stupid problem and
I want middle grade because I found to

36
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,390
be explored

37
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:35,880
ok I was a hero I was cool I went down
there

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,070
up there to the office because we were
down there in the production area I can

39
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,920
be printed out of the diagram and said I
found your for you did it wrong for me

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,510
was he happy

41
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,790
we never became really good friends and
that's somehow how could people think I

42
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,739
found a weakness I broke your stuff I'm
so smart and cooling you I'm small you

43
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:10,379
because I can bring you let me forget
about the complexity of systems

44
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,690
system sometimes you forget about to
overuse and you think how can then

45
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,539
though teachers how can this happen and
complexity

46
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:29,060
it's very too complex to write a good
cause if it's robotics many pops meeting

47
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,130
the same time if an application so when
you do that much complexity sometimes

48
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,520
you forget to look at a detailed or just
you don't find it until it well trained

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,820
so Beijing development but I'm smart to
because it brings you can bring stuff

50
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,449
can you build it yourself

51
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,330
many times up in security conferences
and there was another cool I'm so cool

52
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,099
I'll break stuff and he wrote a nice
writing script you can download the code

53
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:03,860
because icon code so I can do what you
do but I'm smiling because they've been

54
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,010
breaking the same thing I did my first
codrescu's PLC programming I kinda

55
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:21,169
program penalties but I could trust to
the sometimes I think I miss you in the

56
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,539
program actually is indication that
smile off ska project they're not

57
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:35,449
trained to lower interest paid a broken
bone you suppose but think about the

58
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:41,130
mindset of people think of my people
minds work this photograph I took an

59
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,159
island had a much less bicycles in the
Netherlands and only bicycle I spotted a

60
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:56,159
placement says no bicycles here it's
obvious you mind is like don't think

61
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,570
about it and sometimes by not saying
something you just threw me I do

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,400
training to develop Estates is a

63
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,969
just come down and abroad program and
not be able to say how to fix it will

64
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,910
help them to hear that they're really
cool hackers I'm gonna go disappointed

65
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,699
because they're like oh I'm so cool it
should be animated but it doesn't work

66
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:26,940
so I'm so cool look at all the weapons I
have to make proposals availability I am

67
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,199
really cool I will get a big guns and
shoot your application so hey I'm have

68
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,139
college though I used my deployed it
everybody can have now actually I had

69
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,740
one customer receive another company
used armitage against their server on

70
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:54,560
Hail Mary and as I remember how can you
do that it's going to be too bad the

71
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,669
trust having to do that doesn't make you
real Hecker and I must be over CTF

72
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:09,440
project I don't feel like I do CTS and I
am i three times price windows still not

73
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,469
very good but default security
professional because in a PDF challenge

74
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,560
every challenge his availability of it
would not be a challenge all you need to

75
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,020
do it's fine just bought it utopian
uploaded you don't have to understand

76
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,030
availability is just exploded and
dedication thing but it would

77
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,849
occasionally most part there's no writer
so I need to talk and I got my points

78
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:44,789
that it's easy for you to call ahead but
if you all don't wait for you have to

79
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:56,969
cool story babe you for you to help them
making stuff only meet you divide

80
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:06,169
and maybe I'm getting old I don't know
this but each other universities and

81
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:12,329
didn't like the generation gap gets
bigger and bigger and it's very hard to

82
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,969
find developers through security and
people actually Midlands the pundits

83
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,449
empty and no developers

84
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:28,449
security stuff I said of course not what
do development doom developing and I see

85
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,829
the two turnovers in the Netherlands
with a big problem because you are you

86
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,289
available for half a year

87
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,519
men become media 22 years and then you
should be seeing it develop otherwise

88
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,969
you are slow and then you see it above
what is your career path be more senior

89
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,459
senior developer noting you to be an
architect or a manager because then you

90
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:54,758
get more money so we are killing so much
knowledge because there's no period plus

91
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:00,660
available so you see the development and
and move on a device that you like

92
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,740
appreciating developers being towards
doing it for years

93
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,850
something that missus and robust
security tests even rules because hey

94
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm the pool guy with all my stall and I
have stuff but experience they like a

95
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,949
lot of young people there that's normal
it should be like that it's

96
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:25,250
understanding communication like the
idea of being able to talk we are very

97
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,790
confident in front of a computer
somewhere in the basement not be around

98
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,069
us and Mina machine but we have to learn
to talk that's one thing but we have to

99
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:40,870
learn to talk to other people with other
mines it understand the take home with

100
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,379
checklist this is all broken so
everyone's the possible to do with this

101
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:55,370
yeah it's broken and get a report saying
hold this is all bad reports what is

102
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:03,160
going what have you done what did you do
I see a movie bored that's something in

103
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,630
the Netherlands functional testing is
really a high standard with all function

104
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,710
tests are not technical

105
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,810
and David along with security had a
really good estimating how much

106
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,280
attention on application whenever
security test there's always time folks

107
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,670
because security is expensive to be to
blame for says 1341 read-back works

108
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,430
though how much testing do you get
because their intake

109
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,189
reporting one half a song so he has
three days left

110
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:45,530
rule what do you do three days running
towards an end would you do if your time

111
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,870
trying to false positives and give them
and then they get a report so when i

112
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,780
receive a reboard I almost never get the
whole intermediate funds because I want

113
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:04,110
to see what did you do what you haven't
done so different things hey let's try

114
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,740
to myself tonight against the same tools
the same cruising around the same test

115
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,830
and the only saw a dozen since you have
to fix it don't say hey disorder the

116
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,890
false-positive findings I get a
difference in findings so what happens

117
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,900
those have you seen them have you ever
seen the report also should say those

118
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,780
findings have been reported dead toolbar
they were not respond with issues by

119
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,870
mister I'm you get a top-secret PDF
reboard

120
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,920
report profile in bed because yes I have
things the payload so I can log onto my

121
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,550
application because then the link
doesn't work so I have to click the link

122
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,140
and hoped applications the same state so
there's a little groups then I can see

123
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,520
what this program and I get a channel
description would be fix doesn't help me

124
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,640
develop not really I need a description
of what has been done on the stand right

125
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,439
of the people to newburgh worry it's a
dynamic application so if the panel

126
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,390
groups many times depending on the stage
of the dynamic application form pdf yeah

127
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:36,140
Thnkx for management mass text me and
let me talk to me when you get to report

128
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:44,390
I get in line what are we paying or
develop muscle to develop their best

129
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:50,939
because if it was having too much from
who you are is a developer be proud of

130
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,610
it as somebody seeing him of this

131
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:02,150
be proud to be developed as you make
people proud of what it do to do is the

132
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,400
Follow button to submit it pointedly the
moment I appreciate them commit care

133
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,470
about him that's what you need people do
care about what it do I thought the

134
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,670
first care about them but their best so
many times because all the different

135
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:27,729
priorities the users don't like to look
at is under stress and be more intuitive

136
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,930
history more shiny fleshy application he
has to leave yesterday so they never

137
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:41,250
good to expensive you will be outsourced
to while away or usual nobody was

138
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,420
developers are still being rely on them
so that's crazy

139
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,699
plants and sweat and tears it's a no
Botox when you get a thing to get best

140
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,890
time to time because he said the
particular you said you need three weeks

141
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:04,210
we sold it for two weeks ahead of sierra
Sky Map Reduce company when I was so far

142
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,890
was developed by the estimate on how
many hours you think this application

143
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,390
will take to complete so I get back to
them he comes to me so he has to be 250

144
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:24,520
hours less is that ok tried something
through hugo you save $250 for you are

145
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,240
happy to walk away but then he realized
he talks to be just a little bit in the

146
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,459
face

147
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:39,849
oh yes even you cannot do this you got
my judgment that's what you asked to

148
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,639
tell you that it is not OK

149
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,360
trusted people have talked to manager ok
he knows me

150
00:14:50,360 --> 00:15:02,929
appreciably do except experience with
the continued to agree to work hard we

151
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,730
do it's really got so prevalent to talk
to testers development tests on the

152
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,040
tests are people we can talk to them
that way to operations even earlier

153
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,618
that's what spring because we are
developing stuff we anticipate testers

154
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:21,439
and then he threw down the basement to
operations so no arrests in the greater

155
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:27,699
so we have continuous delivery companies
like 70 released a day then come

156
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:29,628
security

157
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:37,199
refers to a poultry few then they may be
tested first and then you get a proven

158
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:46,979
and you can really does not work early
integration and very 84 in Horsham chain

159
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,179
Mb

160
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:54,589
UI developer code code 200 you develop
know when something comes by you know

161
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,339
three months ago

162
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:03,399
unit end of this piece of code is no
good read and think of us already know

163
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:10,939
you think three months ago what did I do
that I have a very rare pacific time it

164
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:18,910
has been it isn't will be I have no idea
where three weeks ago and yesterday but

165
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,540
on the menu is developing to think all
the complexity of the code for three

166
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,629
weeks ago then you have to fix something
only takes time to fix it takes you out

167
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,939
of current process and you to get all
the way to make Indonesia all process to

168
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:38,719
think about how to fix the security
should not be like the Ministry of snow

169
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,260
here many times I

170
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,700
come to companies that had the
implementing security family life cycles

171
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:51,910
phones are you do security why because
they are you know I'm here for you

172
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,240
really do totally issues I always
claimed I have to be talking to team

173
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,839
Cobra if you don't have to talk to teams
ok I don't do it we're not doing that I

174
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,310
don't do it cool t-shirt can city do
together this team who knows the code

175
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,109
best who knows the code below the
developer

176
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:20,419
stakeholders second term so we fail to
approach them

177
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,750
prevails over how to live with the
reports them what they think about how

178
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:34,980
we can improve it and now it's very
scary to talk to other people I was not

179
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,220
able to talk about but I got passion
about security cooperation will

180
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,200
determine what their hardest will offer
comes out of the mouths of lions and I

181
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,840
lost developing a low-security a lot
about the tactics are starting to talk

182
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,620
to people in the state and don't always
about security for things they are

183
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:03,159
concerned I didn't offer refuse intake
stuff that I mean you dare to first

184
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,180
meetings always mister manager what do
you hear me talk to professionals

185
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:17,260
diminishes everything to me someone to
say that what I want to hear actually I

186
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,400
think make rich combination have paid me
for Speed smoke because the more you go

187
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,240
out like a secret then you all the
frustrations because they know to

188
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,270
understand you know you have been in the
same place you have been a developer

189
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:40,670
tools and Microsoft no I haven't felt
the pain so you're equal out there no

190
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,850
manager around lightning secret you hear
all the frustrations when they

191
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,159
understand you feel the pain you can be
actually there crowbar to get things

192
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,500
changed according to prove to have no
time

193
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,280
me because you're dead external expert
telling the management you have to fix

194
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:04,879
it so you actually had been determined
to improve that they have trained you

195
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,840
just have to trigger the treated in the
media understand they have to be treated

196
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:21,360
and it's something I really got involved
over 2006 I getting all my videos on the

197
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,580
web because most def for developers it
was not a security conference or heading

198
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,830
toward know it was a community of
developers helping each other to write

199
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,800
SecureCode

200
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,760
first misstatement later why did was the
finding fighting and defending of

201
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,690
unsecured code we learned we understood
is not possible to make one hundreds of

202
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:50,450
security code change mission statement I
think bigger 2008 and saying from make

203
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,620
the risk invisible to the business so
they can do the right decision but what

204
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,800
I found it always thinks few years later
we have generation of our project

205
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,780
guidelines it will spill the break-in
defendants I was developer to build a

206
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,800
comedy Philip

207
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,600
even though us coming from the
development of our meant I think we

208
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:25,169
understand what if you develop us are
you be loose and enjoy myself I'm

209
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,350
develop us something different for
building bridges among others not

210
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:40,990
thinking to do have to say I'm creative
so make them the hero and you have to

211
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:48,220
help me on this computer is the moment
but has been born playing and he needs

212
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:57,560
to make it was your security years as
always how to presenters

213
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,830
here for them love them

214
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:08,669
indians me I don't like having don't be
the guy who kicks that job will be to

215
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:15,220
bullying and said there was blood sweat
and cheers the passion it's in the if

216
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,140
you appreciate them

217
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,070
it in the code if they were I was an
idiot who spent eight hours because I

218
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,679
was allowed to work longer at the office

219
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,520
coding and other stuff I didn't like and
to fix already home to spend the whole

220
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,470
night improvement because I want to be
proud of my coat and I know a year later

221
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:43,170
I look back I did two years ago let's go
and we look back and he called like a

222
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,600
year ago

223
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,899
oh my god what did I do it's good that
means you are improving so be it a child

224
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:03,680
doctor look at the trial and see what's
good where it needs help not taking it

225
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:12,029
with children whereas the nice children
to be as beautiful

226
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:27,719
keep the children you don't have to
wonder why it upset you already get a

227
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:32,940
value-added should intend them with your
children need more care more attention

228
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:41,210
to be the best performers petrovic and
have so understand him talk to them

229
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:48,149
understand what the state business what
is the 2010 campaign is awesome what do

230
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:54,869
you do about security and the still
existing saying nothing I don't believe

231
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:02,699
you what we're doing yet because you're
not always has a security label on the

232
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:10,070
front row tested because as we did it
created the smell of mystics securities

233
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,009
cryptography its complex is a groom lake
metric

234
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:19,950
you get the security test estate
development team and an external even in

235
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,229
a different department desert security
orbit resting place between the black

236
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:26,129
magic outcomes to this report

237
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:31,658
so what is the development tools are
probably use they care about quality

238
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:38,499
initially quality insecurities not a
different because it's about what

239
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:46,019
appears should not be able to do they
have to own death was the metrics like

240
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:51,349
10 always said if the code policy
towards safety performance six holes and

241
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:57,918
that's our country is to treat them even
better job of PMT texts are fine bucks

242
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:05,039
to approach it takes away the
low-hanging fruit and you indicated in

243
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,109
the deferment street so the moment a
check the code in 4-5 mins later the

244
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:20,939
kind of feedback like to get involved
and feedback because it will get it also

245
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,929
gives thumbs up a coat rejected

246
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,179
it's good thank you appreciate make them
along

247
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:36,309
make them constructive improving it bit
by bit rather than basing them saying

248
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:47,389
this is my book reports PDF reports I
really many companies do teach

249
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:55,570
developers in you and say how do the
report even though they tell you about

250
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:03,379
the report gives you put your pants down
and telling the truth and this will cost

251
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:09,678
extra if there's a security guy who
doesn't called reissue a security review

252
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:18,720
on its not willing to explain what he
did was he afraid to share knowledge

253
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,519
knowledge is not that special anymore
and people tend to me wait a minute

254
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,399
you're going to customers you explain
them by the tools and methodologies

255
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:36,178
everything for yes I do and you will be
obsolete one time when we're looking

256
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:42,990
forward to putting back my sympathies on
the table to myself a nice whiskey and

257
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,220
always solved but I think we will have
to us when we have unicorns rainbows and

258
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:56,659
families because we have so much new
developers every year what a trained 103

259
00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:03,419
look at the most simple coding summer
he'll rule it's fraud the box and

260
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:11,049
branches will eventually break into the
court orders from Java 24 hours whatever

261
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,210
language 24 hours and even though to
call it seems that look at this is wrong

262
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:21,440
it's not secure you want to say yes but
we have a little remark saying this code

263
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,100
is not meant to be in production this
whole lot I teach and universities and

264
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,019
told them about prepared statement
promised carries and DBA say yes that's

265
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:35,520
how we do you talk or database

266
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:43,270
duty and ICT approach like the head down
but this is how he taught us to develop

267
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:48,500
this comes because teachers and
universities to have to cope up with new

268
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,150
technologies are taking whatever
language in 24 always learn it making

269
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:58,990
from glasses and then pitched people
cannot explain developers developers

270
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:06,450
should be trained by developers new
technologies like development who knew

271
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:16,110
who is developing apps anybody the
younger people so i dont two teams that

272
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:23,360
like trendy fashion 60 or over some of
the age of 30 2004 general election

273
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:32,510
always helps to get a tension but they
like 150 to develop a 52 you organize

274
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:42,390
our team development he's doing jobs for
15 years given our history

275
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:51,090
mobile apps its fleshy and you need a
new guys who pushing the boundaries are

276
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,510
really going for but in everybody the
young guys and girls run down the clip

277
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:05,030
you need all the guys in me and my
mother you so very Asian Age intended

278
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:14,720
very very important for a good team for
the security team and the development

279
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,960
to make a story when I asked you to
report that the right up and I have a

280
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,559
good provider cannot write novels
otherwise I would have to guess but tell

281
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,330
them what is how I experienced the
application in my right arm I might this

282
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:42,918
application shortly in certain that I
write down what I think its vote

283
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:54,200
starting up with you the episode eight
days and upload functionality or cannot

284
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,270
upload a file bigger than 10 MB and only
three lines will reread what would

285
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,960
happen if you do a 10 files with 5 Mb
reserve online it may be honest and

286
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,100
using process Tuesday can we believed
they were much more on the stand and

287
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,908
tell the story

288
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:20,690
elimination me personally I will have a
hard time understanding why security

289
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:25,980
people charged with money security test
and the change

290
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:40,140
additionally for delivering the report
want to secure taskforce materials

291
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:47,450
company and the one internal guys have
all the people going on security might

292
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,500
be interesting it's not really in the
agreement I was lost to them there's no

293
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,400
security requirement so we have one of
you team ok the guy from the team called

294
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,990
me thank you again so we ended up with a
problem they are developing expect me to

295
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:11,870
do the security it's a team effort on
some have all the Sun is no Java

296
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,100
developer I mean when he started coding
I was standing in both patient and call

297
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,770
quality is dead so now he's a child
development

298
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:27,879
changes you talked about so not always
interested so the next page here says

299
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:39,080
security book is like thank you every
time it seems like she said told me that

300
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,050
security is what the other security
cannot give to other people

301
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:53,850
security is everybody's responsibility
ballistic make the team go well if you

302
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,100
are happy about it

303
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,949
roti making him about its only can be
doing what it should do there's been a

304
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,610
location in america

305
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:09,250
attitudes company has been hacked and of
course there's no internal development

306
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,790
today asked the sofa develop hundred
companies to deliver our simulation

307
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,950
software it's hard but there's no
security requirement is not regulated

308
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:25,910
because it had the entrance with what
money we saw you because they are all

309
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:32,460
known vulnerabilities and you have them
in your code to shoot no responsibility

310
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,270
will change safety military understand
the code when you have a child he

311
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:45,170
described by t-fal should do something
else we also honor time technology

312
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:50,610
leaving time I come to companies about
integrating security independent life

313
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:56,149
cycle what everybody thinks about stars
and science technology to solve our

314
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,130
problem had a guy from the Netherlands
bunk

315
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:09,970
banking their lands so I spent about
poultry few technical analysis comes out

316
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:17,810
ok decided to make an honest and a tool
helps you but that doesn't mean anything

317
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:24,379
by himself but we will have units we
need to easy access is a report on the

318
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:33,040
report early feedback but all the tools
idea the only confined taking problems

319
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:42,379
bucks with the condo its flaws function
of aggression dermagraph normally ask

320
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,870
the audience so markets a technical
problem of lobbying essential problem

321
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:56,010
what do you think what's more the things
that are more bucks influence nobody was

322
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,730
in Stanmore lost embarks

323
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:04,820
against pick people actually its 50 50
half the world birdies we could

324
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,210
eliminate but definitely looking at the
functionality to understand that it's

325
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:16,010
like the common sense but there we are
focusing on it but all the technology

326
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,290
Fogelberg security on the back but the
functionality you only can find it using

327
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:25,090
your brain logical befriended before my
line of court was just looking and

328
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:33,209
functional easy would it be that smart

329
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:39,860
cannot explain what you found the
weaknesses and Spain

330
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:48,918
problem usually simple maybe you have to
understand it just having a two-third

331
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,130
it's not enough

332
00:33:53,130 --> 00:34:00,990
almost and I was avoiding that has been
charged with taking Libya pre always

333
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:07,630
challenges it's a city effort is
different why it's not about the Golden

334
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:14,349
Nugget you upload history we have 10
wins the first three points on

335
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:21,480
explainable ability not a three points
you get for exploiting the booty

336
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:30,440
you get four points hotel and it's a
text to the real people behind the more

337
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:38,980
efforts to create community so that
hundred people over challengers

338
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,839
200 people are big teacher and telling
people about security that's all we need

339
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,099
thank you
