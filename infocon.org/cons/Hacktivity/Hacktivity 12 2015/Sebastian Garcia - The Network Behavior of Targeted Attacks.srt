1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:09,830
hi everyone welcome so many suggesting
that the SIA and I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,070
the natural behavior of targeted attacks
in particular we are going to model this

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,519
traffic to a identified on the network
and this is part of a brush and that

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,729
it's called stratosphere IPS project
that it's depression I'm working with

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:35,520
wait wait I found a lesser is on here so
we are going to talk a little bit about

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,380
how we are researching on detecting this
malware in the network so we are using

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,830
some machine to Sun trying to see what's
working and what's not working so here

8
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,430
in the audience who is working

9
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,980
detecting my war or any type of body in
the network is working with their they

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,769
are upstairs there no one no no my
wallet action ok and specific some apt

11
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,259
attacks someone is focusing on ABDC hey
I just don't go there we have someone

12
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:14,439
there okay so actually we are working
with a lot of my warm bed nets but we

13
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,990
like to focus on apt for two reasons I
will speak now about the shorts recent

14
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,640
one later what the second one the first
reason for me is that apt I'm not going

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,149
to talk about yeah they are advanced no
no they're not advance their Betsy

16
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:33,960
standard percy stands a lot of people no
solid about that so what I like is that

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,669
the goal of the apts is very specific
ride so when you are you are being

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,039
attacked on their attacking someone they
know who they want to attack and they

19
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:49,509
know what they want and how to get it so
this is not the usual amount awarded its

20
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,280
I don't know send them click fraud in
another way or spam or whatever right

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,079
it's not money or it's not usually a lot
of money but they are trying to get very

22
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,548
specific information and these making
the tags very very difficult to detect

23
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:10,220
it right in fact they are not such
advanced tools right what they're doing

24
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,109
like normal attacks some some phishing
emails from malware very very simple

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,659
right

26
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,159
remote access to and that's it it's
working right if you know the city

27
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,420
centre of people from Canada the
research on these are large and they

28
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,569
found that the most of the time they are
you seeing very very normal wear and

29
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,640
only ones they witness and 0 they attack
in an apt case so usually we are dealing

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,640
with very simple staff the problem is
that it's very difficult to analyze so

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,828
if you want to analyze these people here
this is so close so if you want to

32
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:53,760
analyze abt you can get the money while
you can analyze see you can open the

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,349
vinery it's not what I'm doing right I'm
not a binary analysis guy I like the

34
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,619
network traffic so how do you like the
network traffic ok I wonder where

35
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,829
traffic how do you get the network
traffic ok I can I don't know execute

36
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:11,599
them Iowa right so I go there I execute
tomorrow but what it's the problem or

37
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,798
what's the difficulty of executing these
apt my work in my network

38
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:25,060
why it's not the same thing to say I
have the real my work I executed and

39
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,560
even its connecting rod I would say that
the moment up its running the command

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,469
and control is running ads there
everything is perfect why why it's not

41
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:45,010
the same analyses now well something
like that I'm not the target this is

42
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,269
targeted at out I am NOT the target so
they're not going to attack me as they

43
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,010
are attacking some other guy

44
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,859
so it's very important being the target
to have these traffic because I don't

45
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,640
care about the packets in there I don't
care if the package is TCP or UDP why

46
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,750
carries the station of the attack I want
to hear in here I want to my work out or

47
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,959
saying okay now get the document files
no no no

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,000
now forget about 15 get a screenshot or
hate doing something getting kilos

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,899
that's what I want I want the intention
here I want the behavior and that's why

50
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,429
it's so difficult to get this
information so when we tried to execute

51
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,990
it

52
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,660
the first thing we found is the lifetime
of the company's reshot dry so if you if

53
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,660
you are executing them I were like 20
days after being captured in a real

54
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,220
environment that's it you're not going
to find the infrastructure their command

55
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,860
control cell not working nobody's there
listening so they executed lease not not

56
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,400
so good for us right so we can modify
rock my world that's what we did we get

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,190
some normal matter where we modified and
we executed our self and we attack

58
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,660
ourself rather is completely horrible
specifically because there is no

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,360
behavior I cannot thank myself I can
argue you can add me but we are not the

60
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,380
real players here so we didn't need to
get the best traffic we can but

61
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,070
different allies in this type of my
world is an issue

62
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,680
ok so this is a first reason why we are
going to work with targeted attacks

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,370
because we like them because they are
very specific very difficult to detect

64
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,520
and they are quite simple but if you
want to take this in another image in

65
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,120
the age you are you are going to take
this internet ok so they are you haven't

66
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,169
talked ok so I thought he was going to
talk right now you can go to your target

67
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,270
it's time for them so if you're trying
to the deck these in the network right

68
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,859
you have solutions India are you you
have a lot of what you doing really

69
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,080
network I'm not talking about anti-virus
stuff right I'm doing the docking in

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,008
your network so you're putting some file
in there are some ideas

71
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:06,580
sids filtering you start playing with
indicators of compromise right you are

72
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,149
you are registered in a lot of feeds so
you get all the information a lot of

73
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:16,309
demands URLs IP addresses your fetus
coming all the way and you are blocking

74
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:21,020
blocking filter in a large and also you
had a finger prints are you have a

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,469
snarky Carrboro ok actually brought its
not with fingerprints it's a beautiful

76
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,849
language but you are you seen
fingerprints your sim payloads right you

77
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:37,680
are capturing decent you're stopping
them and if this is not working well the

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,409
last last letters latest of the tools we
have his behavior right anomaly

79
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,860
detection so a lot of people is working
on this anomaly detection is nice like

80
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,979
it for sure if you see an immediate
action

81
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:56,438
what's going on but hey yeah we have
some behavior in here so what's the

82
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:02,589
addiction it's working ok who he is
using some anomaly detection software

83
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:09,439
product in the network now here no one
there are there we have through they

84
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,990
exist now it's it's this is working the
problem with an immediate action is that

85
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,729
for anomaly you need to those know what
its normal so you need a normal first

86
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,860
and then you spot the anomaly and how do
you know what's normal because we are

87
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,610
human beings we are changing all the
time our traffic patterns our ideas so

88
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,819
that's an issue if you go to a network
what its normal is changing all the time

89
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,559
so you should adapt again and then you
attach some anomalies and then when you

90
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:45,569
have the anomaly it turns out that an
anomaly is not an attacked and this is

91
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,870
something that usually the people
working with a nominee addiction tend to

92
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,139
forget and anomalies anomaly is not an
addict so who is going to say if these

93
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,009
anomalies and I doubt ok so you need the
people there what time reviewing and say

94
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:05,139
ok here this is an anomaly no years so
it gets very very complicated and in the

95
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,589
end you need people working on that so
there are some issues here I they should

96
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,560
we have is that first

97
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,690
the next time off the indicators of
compromise is unknown

98
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:23,540
so you're looking for how long are you
want to block it one day one our one

99
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,490
month okay how long is that I be in the
least be nobody knows well some people

100
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,849
is analyzing these usually this is not
information go to India if you see the

101
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,599
analyses some information is there for
three months and three months and that

102
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,510
the main east down another word meaning
less than three days right so why

103
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,750
blocking for three months or nobody
knows how to do this correctly and of

104
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,850
course we find these who is very fine
that the domains you go out for blocking

105
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,529
are really really many shoes while some
people I hope I don't know but if you go

106
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:08,080
to reduce total dot com I'm you search
for www.google.com and you say hey you

107
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,160
start I'll give me some indicators of
that you will find like five thousand

108
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,939
people saying this is Molly shoes and
you will find like seventeen thousand

109
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,150
thousand people saying this is normal

110
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,939
socially this is confusing right if you
have a dramatic toll working with these

111
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,670
data you'll have a lot of domains that
tire false positives and you are

112
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,719
blocking them so they have an
appreciation is very important and

113
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,280
nobody's looking at these right now all
sorry so also have a huge huge amount of

114
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,410
information one my work and generate
those whose of the mains I don't know

115
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,589
dozens of IBS + be nose pliers finger
beans so you are more more more more

116
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,640
everyday and actually you don't know
what you're blocking you don't know what

117
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,900
you are not blocking that that's part of
the game and also this information is

118
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,280
static so it's not changing its not
evolved in its not adopting that's an

119
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,680
issue and finally for the attackers is
very very easy to adapt to these

120
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,250
measures right they cost of adopting its
not so much change in IB I have a lot

121
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,259
like the main I can register thousands
right so you don't care

122
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:26,129
actually lesion without a car cities
they don't care I remember once in ready

123
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:36,009
to really offer real bob Bennett out or
I he say I have something I 100,000

124
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:42,289
bought and I can use them and I'm 17
span and some user was asking the my

125
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,369
world tour

126
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:49,309
hey how are you sending the money or I'm
checking the sorry not in my wildest I'm

127
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,228
sending this time and didn't understand
each being real and which is your best

128
00:10:54,229 --> 00:11:01,919
way of sending this man in such a way
and the guy say I don't care if you send

129
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,009
the incorrect image that people will
know and they will want to be sorry

130
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:14,959
won't be able to open your email you pay
for me I send your 1,000,000 you don't

131
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,138
think I don't say you pay me I say I
don't care if they email is open or not

132
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,149
open or whatever they're making a lot of
money and they have a lot of resources

133
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,439
so this is an issue and most of them
they don't care they just get another

134
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,939
domain they are another I B that seed
they're blocking it

135
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:35,179
regenerate tomorrow it's difficult it's
costly maybe but it's not impossible

136
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:41,019
right so we have this issue here's an
immediate action like I told you most of

137
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,679
the time is very very difficult to know
if it's working right so what are we

138
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,539
going to hear what what we are working
in the University its in some behavior

139
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:57,850
methyl but instead of focusing on animal
protection we are focusing on the

140
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,939
behavior of them our traffic so we go to
the network and say ok this is my work I

141
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:07,449
know it's my world because I'm analyzing
need and I want to learn which is the

142
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,439
behavior are part of the mile in the
network and that's what we are going to

143
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:19,719
now show the stratosphere IPS Prussia is
the core of the National University I'm

144
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,369
I didn't say but it's University Czech
Republic so you can find it online

145
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:32,120
everything is publish these are the four
pillars or main ideas of the brochure

146
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,050
the first one is free software why why
why we want for supper here it's not

147
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,550
because we love we suffer we loved to
suffer but it's not because of that is

148
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,620
because we know the community and we
want the community to verify what we are

149
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,930
doing we needed people checking in the
know the destiny and we need everyone's

150
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,279
a head is not working is russia now this
is working these new Camaros here we can

151
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,350
make it better we can collaborate we can
send you stuff we cannot or stop doing

152
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,720
that or something like that so she
suffers one of my main dealers the

153
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,930
second one is NGOs and civil society
organisations so at some point this

154
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,020
season

155
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,800
people say that in the Euro survey that
the ngos the non-governmental

156
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,719
organizations they are in a critical
situation because they don't have the

157
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,260
resources to buy very complex tool for
protection they cannot buy from very

158
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,580
large companies but anyway there have
been attack a simple very very powerful

159
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,720
government so for example they work with
the Dalai Lama and TV ad was attacked by

160
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,830
china china's have very very powerful
country and their attack the dilemma

161
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,529
complete with success right you are
completely successful that I and they

162
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,230
didn't have the resources they have the
money that people they cannot defend

163
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,760
ourselves so we are focusing in this
type of organizations were they are very

164
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,990
very amazing targets for the Tigers but
they don't know how to do the they don't

165
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,880
know how to the fans so this is the
second pillar of the stratosphere IPS

166
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,650
project the thoroughness and machine
learning and behavioral models we want

167
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,730
to have our research working in the
network we want to have listened to

168
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,279
these our research to be useful so we
want actually developed a network and

169
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,370
played and we wanted to work and this is
usually the result people don't like

170
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,709
this so much why you are doing something
is awesome you publish papers a lot of

171
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,949
them and when you are trying to eat in a
real environment

172
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:40,310
yeah maybe child or so and the last is
the verification we want these to be

173
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,829
very very very fine we wanted to try as
much as we can to see what what's going

174
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,330
on how we are doing it's having errors
it's not having errors which is why we

175
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:57,870
have this arose so these are the four
pillars of the stratosphere now how are

176
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,970
we doing these how are we working with
machine learning in the traffic so we

177
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,150
started with these idea of lettuce more
so when we start working machine

178
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,439
learning you can attempt to work with a
lot of features and we are going to say

179
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,080
that nah nah nah nah no use less
information this is the first that we

180
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,390
are going to talk about the second one
is that this association we are going to

181
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,220
disassociation two models and I want to
show you now on the third one is the

182
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:33,870
briefing gatien ok so this means we are
analyzing off the connections not the

183
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,480
behavior of the host another hit of the
network this means that if you're going

184
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,400
to the network I don't care about the
behavior of the three thousand holes I

185
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,709
care about one simple connection and
that's why we are able to create this

186
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,380
behavior model because if you try to
create a model of the computer itself

187
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,150
it's very complex the usual is very
complex so we are not doing that the

188
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,270
second point is the disassociation and
that means that the representation of

189
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:11,240
the behavior in the network how we look
at the behavior it's separated from how

190
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,580
we detect the behavior ok usually this
is altogether but we are separating it

191
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:26,180
and finally verify the models with real
data we need a real data here so less is

192
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,829
more

193
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,400
this means that when you connect sorry
when you connect to any any other

194
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,290
computer on internet your behavior is
the same so you gonna do gmail and you

195
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,949
are checking emails your child in the
way you charge they were you check

196
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,870
facebook they way you use a website

197
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:50,020
side there we're sorry the way you use
your bank account is usually the same

198
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,360
all the time and this is going to
identify your behavior of others right

199
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,820
this second is dad we grow up

200
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,470
group of the flow all the flows in the
network go into specific service

201
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,740
altogether so imagine that you're gonna
do Gmail web server so we get all the

202
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,240
packets and flows that you are sending
that port 80 of Gmail and we say this is

203
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,550
your connection and we are going to
analyze that and finally sees a

204
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,709
connection is composed of several close
we can see the behavioral patterns here

205
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:32,900
so in the case in the case of my work
and in the case of you when you are

206
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,590
using for example any web page you're
going from one state to the other like

207
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,820
chatting not charging like the unloading
stuff no tunnel in stuff like putting

208
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,169
information in a web page not putting
that picture looking at pictures click

209
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,010
any picture you are going jumping from
stage to stage and that what we want to

210
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:59,230
model right so each flow is going on
against its own stage in our model I

211
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,440
want to give you one stage for each flow
you have and our model for this stage

212
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,380
it's based on four features and these
are very simple right

213
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,490
we are looking at the size of the flow
direction of the flow wdet of the flow

214
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,059
and the time between flows so I'm gonna
not gonna get into the periodicity

215
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:24,830
because it's quite an issue to go to
have that information but you can see

216
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,740
that this is very simple right

217
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,910
youu cindy's you can have very very
amazing features a year and the reason

218
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,750
is that we try those amazing features
and they're not working they are too

219
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,759
complex right and when the commodities
too complex and then you go and check

220
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,619
if the model is not working you know why
or wars when the moment is working on

221
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:51,968
your detecting you know why so at some
point is very very difficult to work

222
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:57,709
with that and that's why we have these
four features here ok so what we are

223
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:02,179
doing with these features we are
creating a stable horrible table the

224
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:11,570
table it saying okay you got 1300 under
flow has a smaller size and then the

225
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,289
duration of the flows maybe medium the
periodicity overflow

226
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:23,749
week period the city so I went to give
you a capital be or if the periodicity

227
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:29,699
is weak and your site is medium and your
directions along I will give you capital

228
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:34,639
F or you have a week number this city or
strong number of this is all we are

229
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:39,289
saying let their son numbers to each
following the network based on these

230
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:46,309
features are gay and finally we are
using some symbolism here like their dad

231
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:52,769
star on zero indicates the amount of
time between the flows because having a

232
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:57,009
periodicity of five minutes is not the
same as having a bit of this video of

233
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:03,849
three days later the city is completely
different behavior so we are trying to

234
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:09,678
get information here and if the flow has
said time and time out of one hour we

235
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,759
are putting a zero ok special sample
there so let me show you how we can look

236
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,990
at this

237
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:35,720
so so for example I'm not sure if you
come to get these will see can you see

238
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:44,070
that are not it's very few upsets can
you see that now completely know maybe

239
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:53,080
if we turn down the lights LED here can
we try that now

240
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:00,830
ok I will walk three don't worry it's
it's horrible anyway cells each line

241
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:07,840
here it's a connection it's one computer
connected to other computer specific

242
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,350
bored so each identified as one flow
right so here you can see that for

243
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,409
example there is a connection to DNS
service these red letters and I'm sure

244
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:27,309
you cannot get from there so this is
early plus a new free see the doors

245
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:33,610
there nobody sitting here because the
periodicity the periodicity was between

246
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:39,580
the letter and the letter I ride so if
you go to you are you're not really

247
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:48,689
anymore so actually actually this is not
for you and this is a port 8080 and

248
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:55,050
these normal connection this is a normal
computer doing everyday tasks if you

249
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,159
look at this specific connection you
will see that there is a very strange

250
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:06,280
board 9131 and you can see some
publicity here age mean police et al

251
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,809
this is Dora connection so they Weather
Service of tour when you are above 18

252
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,220
the tour salaries you get some publicity
in there

253
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,980
so here you can see a lot of letters as
as you can imagine most of the

254
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,640
connection is just one or two flows
right because its normal way Bejawada

255
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,390
webpage dunno something that's it you're
not exist in every web page four hours

256
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:51,220
so let me show you another one and we
will use it later

257
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,240
you can see here that is also gonna get
into a lot of UDP and TCP connections

258
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,210
this is not very early and then here we
have shown previously CDI combi I got my

259
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:10,250
age I got my age I am i jus dont see a
pattern here I'd so this pattern is very

260
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,419
very it's a very characteristics of
these command-and-control

261
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,880
command-and-control disagreed really
connection and skipping on going and

262
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,860
going and going so this is one my
worries calls this is a real execution

263
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:43,678
so I want to show you a real execution
of that so we executed this and you can

264
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,890
see here a lot of connections to port 80
a look at these World is a command

265
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,760
control but this is not right and this
one yes this is sporadic and it is not

266
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,090
on this is not radical right so mirror
have differing command control and each

267
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,189
command countries having a different
behavioral pattern actually we can know

268
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,450
that these type of contract is another
type of community and you can see here

269
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,600
yeah it's completely certainly are now
these monies is perot league and you can

270
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,590
see he also some some time out so this
is how

271
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:49,039
read and when I show you for example for
example DC's ok so this traffic from

272
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,330
your computers so this is how the
computers here are behaving right and

273
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,330
you can see some people get into some
webpages UDP traffic disagree traffic

274
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,408
and most of the people is just connect
them to web page and that's it right you

275
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:07,770
can see that there are no brutally CDs
no command and conquer China nothin

276
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,520
lyrics behaving like something that
looks militias Fri so this is a very

277
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,200
easy way to look a lot of traffic here
is horrible education right by the tool

278
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,240
is looking at automatically and you can
see like okay there is no more here that

279
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,090
looks like a command-and-control China
also attack or something like that of

280
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,360
course we are not trying to the day like
a specific attack like going to a

281
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,309
webpage unexplored and that's it that's
for that you have antivirus you have a

282
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:40,080
lot of tools we want to see what's going
on in the network we want to see the

283
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,199
behavior here that's why if you only
have a very short the tag we are not

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,679
going to get it and actually we cannot
not for that we want to see when you are

285
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,559
being a dad like an abd

286
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,389
your documents are being excellent
rating for example these we can capture

287
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:21,149
also is used but now that ok so this is
what is a very very large cup choice

288
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,208
like 25 days and you can see a lot of
traffic he lowered his ride a lot of

289
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:35,029
traffic but you see a strange stuff so
you will see stretched like 000 oz and

290
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,969
something of the city but then this is
not really but it's very early but it's

291
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:44,679
not again you know what this type of
traffic ease this is there is used but

292
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:50,190
not connecting to Google so these are
all good I P addresses and uses using

293
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,940
Google for a lot of stuff but you can
see if you remember the normal traffic

294
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,619
that even when you access your traffic
does not look like this so we can

295
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,439
differentiate between a normal goal
connection and some are you are abusing

296
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:15,329
I hear these extreme here they became
pure even this one look at these its

297
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:23,299
periodic but we have nine zeros W nine
hours between two fellows socios is

298
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:28,249
sending a flow waiting nine hours and
sending another one and we can calculate

299
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:34,259
these right and we can create a mother
from the show going back to the

300
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:39,029
presentation

301
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:45,379
once we have these letters what what's
going on with you here you see here so

302
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:50,089
this month is generating this same
behavior of others over and over again

303
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:53,219
when it's connecting with a
command-and-control it's the same here

304
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:58,119
actually we can see when the common in
countries down because they're my world

305
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,649
keeps connecting but the behavior is
different

306
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:06,390
so we can distinguish these situations
also changing the behavior is very

307
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,200
costly for the attacker because if you
want to connect all your body at the

308
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,810
same time and you want to give orders at
the same time you need some time for

309
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:21,090
synchronization in there and if you lose
the synchronization it's more difficult

310
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,209
for you you cannot use all of them at
the same time it may be more difficult

311
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,180
to make a deal with saddam right shot
some point you can change the city its

312
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:36,040
ok we can still capture the change but
you you want to connect if you don't

313
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,810
want to command control you cannot
country roads so you need any command

314
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:46,600
and control and that's why it's costly
for the tiger saw this behavior does not

315
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,560
expire easily of course they infections
can go unnoticed for hours so how much

316
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,840
time are you willing to wait for a
solution in your network usually we say

317
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,790
I one real-time detection relied very
very very quickly but naturally the

318
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:09,290
computers can be effective for our
survey and nobody knows and so on you

319
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,800
and you can tell the administrator can
go there and clean that computer and

320
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,800
it's going to take hours so there isn't
enough time here to capture their

321
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,280
behavior we need this should not
awarding one minute right and finally we

322
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,860
collect both normal and my world
behavior we want them both

323
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:34,399
we would need to know what's normal we
need to know how normal looks like and

324
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,300
then we can implement these so how can
implement attention for this type of

325
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,820
truck ok so this is the first part to
remember that this association the

326
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,250
letters is how you look at the models we
are not doing that actually here so far

327
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,300
no no fancy machine learning so now that
we want to implement this reduction how

328
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,450
are we going to do that so the
stratosphere pressured know it's

329
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:04,020
implemented two models and tomorrow on
the working I will talk about the first

330
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,470
one that is the interpretation

331
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:12,179
Shin of the transition from one letter
to the other letter as a mark of change

332
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:20,090
ok show how are we doing these ok this
is very very easy stuff actually if you

333
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:26,059
have the letters he hear a coma agency
blow the bloody plus we are looking at

334
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:33,770
the transition from each letter to the
next one and this transition as a mark

335
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,059
of change that means that do have
emergency here that's an okay so the

336
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:44,860
probability to go from the literary
electorate coma each one or one hundred

337
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,750
percent on the probably different gonna
do a response I've I like that for

338
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,220
everything so we learn this transition
probabilities we create Ahmad reads the

339
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,620
Magic's cumby look like these days is
the same rights just diagram by Lisa ok

340
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,649
from going from a to come on the
probabilities one from column A to Z its

341
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:12,490
point five from CD blast so we can
follow how the transitions were in the

342
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:18,390
original model were ok and one we have
these transitions we create this market

343
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,720
models of the norm behavior so we can do
kids use for a long time or for anybody

344
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,950
and we can capture this model this
behavior we create the mark of change

345
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,929
the Magic's everything we need and we
have them all already ok now that we

346
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:38,340
have these smaller is that they know
what they are these are common in

347
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:46,470
control of this is another type of
attack now we can get a non traffic for

348
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:53,590
an honored work and we can try to
compare say okay the question he's which

349
00:31:53,590 --> 00:32:00,030
is the probability that this traffic was
generated with this model that's why we

350
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:05,389
are using numerical change for sale que
was actually very very low again and

351
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,860
which is a probability of being detected
by the second molar ok it's like they're

352
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,490
under 31 and then we choose our so OK
from all these follow including the

353
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,240
normal ones the probability that you
were generated by command-and-control

354
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,960
bonnet it's these why I will say that
you are a command-and-control ok this is

355
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,710
how it's being the dad that idea it's
not perfect of course but so far it's

356
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:39,780
working so I want to show you some more
stuff so the first thing I will show you

357
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:49,408
how to see the difference between two
models so no

358
00:32:49,409 --> 00:33:01,100
ok so we show you the difference between
my goal is to use your see their mother

359
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,689
is called zoo's animal what is called
above I'm not sure the name exactly so

360
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:11,490
the Second Mile bubble was created about
some people that may be here in the

361
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,059
christmas love people there

362
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,080
air so thank you very much it was
awesome

363
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,129
go later because they created this
amazing model and they are trying to see

364
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:28,350
how other teams detected ride so this is
amazing for us because he's like ok

365
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,620
something that is very real number is
difficult and very well done so most of

366
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,110
the people that it's trying to detect
that in the computer they're trying but

367
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:46,369
we are going to see how so how we can
see the traffic between 50 on other one

368
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:56,139
of our legs use so these fiction that we
are going to do I'm going to show you

369
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:03,699
what happen if we compare the model of
bob with the border of the use and this

370
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,690
is a comparison on the return ok so that
these stands between the government work

371
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:14,369
on this use my power is actually is
actually very close to one here these

372
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:20,300
are the first then flows and this means
that they are quite similar the behavior

373
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,159
of the boys quite similar to one of the
behavior of these bad if we keep looking

374
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,669
at these not then flows but give me 30
give me 30 flows and we don't see their

375
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:37,020
behaviour start to change start to
diverge and if we want more flows like

376
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,659
50 flows it's Mardi mardi friends who
wanna 100 flows it's more different so

377
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:50,159
every time we are putting more clothes
we conceded a behavior between bob 10

378
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:58,599
starts diver dream this means that the
early behavior of these CPUs is similar

379
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:08,470
but later on in the network they grow
apart so we are trying to use this time

380
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,330
to the tech the bubble traffic in the
network

381
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:25,480
so for doing something so I'm going
around experiment in the tool I didn't

382
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,930
tell you but this is a stratosphere
testing framework is one of the tools we

383
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:38,580
have for experimentation so I'm gonna
run experimental ok use they see use and

384
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,700
get all the traffic from bubble and tell
me how you are detecting it when you are

385
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,259
you taking wad right so when you run
these about the description when you run

386
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:57,040
these its own ok I'm going to separated
traffic every time slot sorry like five

387
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,370
minutes or 10 min each of the fifty
manage money in each of these I will

388
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,250
tell you if the models are much more not
I will tell you ok

389
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:17,170
idea that there's something so I will go
back here or upset and you can see quick

390
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:23,000
but you gotta hear that in the first the
first time slot this indicates starting

391
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,830
the time slot here on it from 00 mean
age 25 minutes you can see that there

392
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:34,190
are some IP addresses in the traffic
there are no one truly delivers that

393
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:39,370
means that when I was looking at the
traffic there is no indication that this

394
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:45,339
is our behavior yet it's just some
packets in there and also we didn't

395
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,180
predict nothing so there are no the
directions

396
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,850
no known traffic in there nothing
happened so far in the second in the

397
00:36:52,850 --> 00:37:02,049
second time so I'm sorry I used the
horrible from a design point I'm sorry

398
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:08,930
but you will have to believe me here in
this Luis staff it says so it means that

399
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:15,430
the problem I were in here it's using
this I B and we know it's using the

400
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,359
command and control and we put the label
body and in there for sure this is a

401
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,580
botnet or tomorrow

402
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:26,319
but we didn't detect them so her mother
is not much here so in the first two

403
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,420
times there are no the nation's that's
why the type of aris false-negative

404
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,310
remiss if we didn't capture but in the
next time to load that means that

405
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,320
fifteen minutes later we were able to
the take the bubble would net with their

406
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,380
zoos command-and-control Malo so we have
a true detection here we have a true

407
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,780
positive this means that at this point
the model Marg and we were able to

408
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,510
capture it we were able to detect it but
if you keep looking

409
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,950
the next the next time floods we didn't
detective because you remember that show

410
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,339
you that the mothers were divergent the
mothers get different from time to time

411
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,890
so after some point this is not similar
anymore but was enough for the detection

412
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,970
ok so this is one way that we can
experiment with these are not the end of

413
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,109
the experiment you have what's been
detected in are you have all the fancy

414
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:27,630
measures to positive and then you can
see ok is this model for the picture or

415
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:34,620
we need more so this was an example of
you seen it is used for the detection of

416
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:43,910
bob there are other models we try also
we now call

417
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:51,899
ok now that also was able to detect
viable and then we can use now the

418
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,380
bubble model for other staff of course
if I'm using the bubble model for the

419
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,620
dictum bubble it will detective hey
that's cheating because I don't know in

420
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,960
advance I should find bubbling the
network what you see in which her to lie

421
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,830
have that's why we are losing their
mothers are ready in the data is fully

422
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:19,340
decked in the new unknown traffic so I
will continue with the presentation so

423
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,250
we can see the distance we do mothers we
can experiment that ok use all these

424
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,200
mothers in this traffic tell me what you
find especially then what

425
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:37,149
when you find these and these by
generalizing I won't speak about that

426
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:45,200
here about the generalized in such a way
that we are detecting similar traffic

427
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,850
not exactly the same so I won't know I
want to say something here so yeah there

428
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:59,930
were a few K sean is it working or not
is like if you go to any antivirus

429
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:12,180
company or any production company or not
you know I don't know if some of these

430
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,500
things

431
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:20,790
yeah we're working very very amazingly
because if I change the network if I

432
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,700
change their dad if I gently time mean
if I change the normal people maybe

433
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:37,560
change country so for us is very
important diversification so yeah I were

434
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,779
more hour when with these data said with
these levels with these people with

435
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,230
dystrophy these way of verifying because
remember show you the experiment using

436
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:55,930
five minutes if you're using 10 minutes
or one hour 1 minute is completely

437
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:02,660
different so also it means how do you
consider a detection successful for

438
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,810
example you have my word in there and
you want to say yes I can do what what

439
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:14,009
kind of the community the whole traffic
onto the deck each package as much as I

440
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,580
know each bucket maybe not

441
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:20,480
ok can you the day each follow each
connection each IP others what what can

442
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,500
you dig so it depends how you can get
directions on then you have the final

443
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,140
studies to examine you braid or if
measured over $99

444
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,150
99 percent so be careful with the people
is giving you this type of resource and

445
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:43,470
say yeah it's amazing so we are ready
say depends on the data said the time

446
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:50,759
frame and that's why we are using our
parish in a very large that a third of

447
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,750
my where traffic you can find it in the
face of stratosphere IBS . or you can go

448
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,920
there and the result of that said you
can follow the the load of in there you

449
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,800
can ask questions asked for new data
sets or whatever because we need these

450
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:15,280
to be barry fire right very very
difficult but having normal is far more

451
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,640
the vehicle on another side we have a
lot but norma was traffic there with the

452
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,390
labels that it's a yes this is normal so
we are doing this very slowly we are

453
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:39,830
going to any computer and check in like
his normal ok so traffic so we are gonna

454
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:45,509
find it hosts by host and that's why I
saw your traffic

455
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:51,369
finally we want to compare approaches
what tools are doing with this that they

456
00:42:51,369 --> 00:43:01,149
are not detecting this is very very
important so I would stop here I wanna

457
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:06,009
say that the network behavior for us
very very important and we think that

458
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:12,019
this type of work using machine learning
artificial special behavior it's gonna

459
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:18,939
give us very good do so in the future so
that's it that's the way baseball for

460
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:26,830
the Prussian if you wanna go sorry the
people upstairs stratosphere IPS or

461
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:40,369
so

462
00:43:40,369 --> 00:44:30,740
not just one connection so you have two
different behaviors generating similar

463
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:35,410
package and they're a bit difficult to
distinguish so so far all the gaming we

464
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:40,578
saw on this streaming we can
differentiate for example our worst

465
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:47,609
enemy I would say is the online music
like online radios this type of websites

466
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:53,089
are generating a picture of this is that
it's very hard to distinguish from all

467
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:56,930
the money so we have to be very careful
with his mother that's why we are

468
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:02,859
training them and we can do this another
some thresholds here's a look at this

469
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:08,759
model is very good this mother is not so
who so when we are you see we know where

470
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:13,470
to draw the line ok with his mother so
much because it's much in another false

471
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,680
positive for example right and then the
other part of the question is that in

472
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,680
the future what we are going to do is
that we are going to get all the

473
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,899
behaviors of your computer and we are
going to take a decision based on all

474
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,739
over them so I don't care if you're
doing something i wanna know if I do you

475
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:35,769
also doing something normal I i doing
something like command-and-control like

476
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:40,450
how is the behavior all all your
computer at the same time so that's

477
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,288
better for differentiating these very we
are proud but they're treating its true

478
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:50,940
sorry another another thing religion
with this is that when my worst start

479
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,500
starts Miki

480
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:04,020
their normal behavior of people that's
why it's very difficult to to the doctor

481
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:15,410
the question is would in this sounds I
don't care or the people don't care so

482
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:21,730
much being attacked because you have you
have a lot of way of stopping bad they

483
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:27,640
should you cannot detect when you
successfully and you are so many

484
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,730
formation and you are communicating so
successful so that's why we went to the

485
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,910
day when the attack was successful and
nobody's the DR number antivirus not the

486
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,640
fire will not intimidation and you don't
know what's going on so that's in the

487
00:46:40,640 --> 00:47:02,400
place that we want to say okay we can
predict that the rest of the question

488
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,410
ok
