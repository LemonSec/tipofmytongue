1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,830
we are riding the year 2006 and I'm
providing network and security

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:15,049
consulting to an online gaming company
acting mostly in Asia Pacific and called

3
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:23,900
in by the weekends because of strange
performance of the servers and all kind

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,528
of interruptions of the services they
are providing to the players after first

5
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,030
investigation I'm finding out there to
lead that the problem they have is not

6
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,829
at all related to their own network is
not only related to their own servers

7
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,890
and is actually member all related also
to all the reversals network devices the

8
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,930
players actually are two recent order to
get to the gaming environment I see from

9
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:05,820
our perspective very very big delays
jitters and some stages even total

10
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:13,210
impossibility to reach the gaming
servers understanding that the problem

11
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:20,059
is not on their side we are calling the
colocation provider actually the

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,270
environment where the solution is
installed and telling them that there is

13
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:32,039
a problem they don't know about nothing
they begin to investigate on their sides

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,329
and vote last actually also understand
that everything is external to the

15
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:43,139
border routers nothing is actually wrong
and their network so and their sides

16
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,689
they're doing the next step and they're
calling actually the year major ice be

17
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:54,699
that is providing the big pipe that is
actually used in order to have the

18
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,850
Internet traffic heading to the site
when a talking to the ice speed that is

19
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,179
speed tells them that actually yes I
have seen some problems in the network

20
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,750
but they're also not really aware of

21
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,480
was going on and they tell them we will
call you back let us just check out what

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:28,220
the problem is after the understanding
that they are dealing with a highly

23
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:36,000
volumetric attack and one of the other
customers that contact the customer and

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,750
telling them look we see here very very
heavy traffic reaching Europe so can you

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,250
please take care and can you please
assist in troubleshooting and in seeing

26
00:02:48,250 --> 00:03:03,700
what's going on all kind of things
together with the ice speed and actually

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,040
after many many hours of troubleshooting
trial and error the ice be understands

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,380
that you will not get probably the
solution from the customer and is going

29
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:23,090
actually to the most radical solution is
actually deciding to making out the

30
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,580
entire traffic of this customer or what
we call also in networking black hole in

31
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:36,070
and actually in this moment everything
is back up and running for all the

32
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,959
others of course also for my customer
but actually his customer that was

33
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,200
attacked is out of service I think it
took something like generous when the

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,988
attack with over and then also his
customer was able to return to service

35
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:04,140
what we see here is actually who are
entities different entities in 2006 that

36
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,859
at all

37
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,860
unprepared first of all it is my
personal my customer did not have the

38
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,630
right tools in order to understand that
actually won the service was interrupted

39
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,959
by yours hardly huh

40
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,580
armed it is not related to the altar
servers and it is not a related to roll

41
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,560
to his own network infrastructure the
next thing was that there's an

42
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,860
application provider was totally
unprepared they did not have the tools

43
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,020
in order to understand themselves that
there is a problem and for the murder

44
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,770
took actually an architectural decision
that they would relying on one major I

45
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,849
speed meaning that the same moment when
the link for the network design speed is

46
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:55,349
saturated they don't have any
alternative and actually their entire

47
00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:02,719
customer base is damaged by the color
additive effect of this attack we're

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,210
moving on moving on through actually the
ISP and here again we have somebody was

49
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,900
unprepared medical thinking that is a
possibility and remind you i'm talking

50
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,310
about 2006 nobody actually thinking off
that there is a possibility to get high

51
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,169
level of protection a must sales so that
when we're talking about a deciduous

52
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,659
asia-pacific at mended is at some island
with anyway

53
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:37,419
low bandwidth capabilities so also
decides he was totally unprepared and

54
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,889
finally there's the customer the
customer that was the victim of the

55
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,719
attack was also prepared so this
customer also buried her long to

56
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,849
understand that they're under attack and
actually the problem was also that the

57
00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:00,500
customer was not able to do anything and
as I mentioned the final resolving the

58
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,449
problem was having the ice speed black
Holden talk traffic I would like to ask

59
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:12,190
you the audience here and I don't know
how experienced you always did us a

60
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,849
textbook rental you read a lot of music
do you think that something like this

61
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,370
can happen also today

62
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,600
tenuous later it's an interesting
question

63
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,990
but they can tell you that there's only
one answer yes unfortunately it can

64
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:47,360
happen in two happens all the time that
was mentioned by the senior concept

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,980
group an Israeli company providing
security services security professional

66
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:05,320
services in Israel and abroad with a
subsidiary in UK as well as another lens

67
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:17,639
I have many years of security experience
in all kind of

68
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:31,430
areas is providing as part of the
service DDoS simulation so risk that is

69
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,900
actually giving customers the
possibility to check and to validate

70
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,698
their preparedness and readiness for the
US attacks what we are doing there will

71
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:48,939
actually similar eating it real attack
on customers that we are working with

72
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:56,800
three teams won t is directing a team of
experts that is responsible to attack

73
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,029
the target system to attack the customer
system another team is the White team

74
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:09,250
it's actually the customer himself there
is doing the same thing he wanted should

75
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:16,620
do when we have a real attack and is
actually trying to fight us in order to

76
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,629
make sure that whatever we're trying to
do is not impacting in any way the

77
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:29,050
service that we are testing then we have
a 13 as I mentioned the blue team this

78
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,909
is actually sitting next to the customer
is responsible for the communication

79
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,120
between the White team and the red team
because you may understand it although

80
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,640
many customers are sometimes in a
confidence level that there is no chance

81
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,839
that we can bring them down

82
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:53,449
it works always and then actually we
need the possibility to push the button

83
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:58,060
to stop the attack immediately because
we're dealing with real services and

84
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,630
second what is also very important is to
provide the transparency of the impact

85
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,779
to the management is ordering the attack
so did we make sure that we are

86
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,720
attacking we get full transparency of
the results and this is of course very

87
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,339
very important in order to give the
possibility to remedy a tormented

88
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:27,209
correct the weaknesses that we find in
the system

89
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:35,579
sorry for the more before joining
concert I was for more than seven years

90
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,569
the chief information officer and chief
security officer of Playtech the biggest

91
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:47,949
online gaming platform provider in the
world and there I had the opportunity to

92
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:56,378
do you was a lot of a lot of very
aggressive DDoS attacks DDoS attacks

93
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:03,699
have seen the US attacks of 250 gigs and
what I'm trying to do in this

94
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:08,670
presentation is actually to bring
together blue things one is my

95
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,829
experience of many many years with
dealing with these attacks as a defender

96
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:21,758
and this is probably what most of you at
least are doing on the other end due to

97
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:28,449
the fact that we are running a deal
assimilation in concert I have also the

98
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,089
possibility that I integrated in this
presentation all kinds of experiences

99
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,910
that I got from our deals expert team
that is part of those testing simulation

100
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,179
exercises so that actually we're
bringing two perspectives together one

101
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,990
of the defender that we're all used to
and actually also the one of the

102
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,810
attacker

103
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,380
I know that forty technical audience
here it is always very very boring to

104
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,720
see numbers will just really very very
shortly talk about some trends and Eidos

105
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,970
I think it's important to mention them
and then I will really immediately go to

106
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:21,410
the case studies or actually exercises
so that you will see common practices

107
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:29,569
that are used in order to mitigate these
attacks and I emphasizing common

108
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:36,380
practices because common practices are
not always best practices and this is

109
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:47,689
very very important to understand next
low-powered of those cases I will bring

110
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:54,520
in all kind of technology limitations
that we have ok that are in many many

111
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,939
places unknown and when you wear adidas
mitigation or when you're planning to

112
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,290
deploy something and last but not least
I would like also to share with you

113
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:16,130
life cycle that the city to avoid many
many problems and mistakes that I have

114
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,250
personally done and many many people in
the industry are doing so let me

115
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:32,430
introduce to you our dealers target they
decided to use of virtual company name

116
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,779
that is targeted has nothing to do with
the targeted was a tech

117
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:42,269
several two years ago so it's really
important that you don't connected to

118
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,370
target it's not a real target but if
there is no better name for a target

119
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,949
company that target actually a very
intense aerial tour for the quality of

120
00:12:52,949 --> 00:13:05,109
the solution so it looks very bad so we
have a really nice backbone we are very

121
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,079
very classical at the moment not

122
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,959
of some online company that is called
target could be anything that could be

123
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:27,329
equal as the rather a border around it
has a low balance or firewall and IPS

124
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:37,019
ok also including an IPS furthermore we
have the front end servers and we have

125
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,689
also caused by consumers and I thought
that it is not needed to go into more

126
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:48,910
details about the architectural now as I
mentioned I would like just to mention

127
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,550
some numbers that you are aware of
what's going on in the world of those

128
00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:01,979
things that are currently comparison of
sick which is today part of Akamai that

129
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,050
is mentioning that we have a 133%
increasing dealers attacks in the world

130
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:16,729
over the last year the amazing thing is
that we see a clear dominance of layer

131
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,689
three Leah for attacks and he would let
us explain where it comes from it comes

132
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:29,740
mainly because also the attackers are
acting under economical assumptions and

133
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,209
what it means is just that it is so easy
to attack successfully customers or or

134
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,229
victims was later three Leah Thor
attacks that there is actually no need

135
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,440
to go further and if there is no need to
go further

136
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,250
other and there is no need for more
investment they will not do that we see

137
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,090
an increase in the average declaration
so if you see last year and was about 17

138
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,120
hours we are today already about 20
hours or almost 21 hours and this is

139
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,760
something that is really the average so
i've seen a text that are going on about

140
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:14,880
the wondrous we see actually that there
is a decrease in the peak bandwidth ok

141
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,630
so with you look this year you see the
big band which is not something that

142
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,220
we've seen in the last year you've seen
all the time and increase its not at the

143
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,580
moment increasing and but what we see is
definitely that the bolometric attacks

144
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:36,420
over 100 gig doubled oK so it's double
than what we had last year and you just

145
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,040
you know when last night I don't know
even if you can read it but what it says

146
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,670
in general is that the most attacked
industry is the gaming industry this is

147
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,060
where I also got all my experience and
you see of course also gaming technology

148
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:57,250
Soria banking technology also industries
that are very very

149
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:06,440
actively attacked by the attacks ok so
now what I would like to do in the next

150
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:14,720
half an hour is to give you an idea
about real and simulated those attacks

151
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,840
on target again

152
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,660
mentioning its not the real target is at
the moment just for the presentation the

153
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,600
company that I called targets what I
will try to show in this presentation so

154
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,640
Indus cases is really also that many
many of the solutions of the concepts

155
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:43,199
that are implemented and actually sold
as bulletproof are not the medicine

156
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,140
against the dose and I'm not always
doing the job

157
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:54,160
ok so you what you see

158
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:03,569
actually the layout is target or
customer and we seek lead and we have

159
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:12,400
several botnets coming form various
autonomous systems attacking or target

160
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:21,900
company would like to talk about the
real the first real attack is actually a

161
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:30,920
30 so take off all metric nature in this
case you can see your debt targets to do

162
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,890
not have any specific details mitigation
capabilities implemented in the network

163
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,120
they have all the standard things we
know but there is nothing related to the

164
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,639
US and actually they're currently
attacked targets security team

165
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,170
understands that something is going on
in is actually trying to free think

166
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,600
something that naturally all of us would
do

167
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,409
when you are attacked you looking was
attacking you so what they're doing the

168
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,070
first stage they are actually beginning
to search for IP addresses that are

169
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,300
coming out as not valid connections and
are beginning to block down with access

170
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:21,570
lists on the rollers yo fast they
understand actually that the attack is

171
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,600
ramping up it begins to be too strong

172
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,959
there are others are not able to deal
with it they are contacting their ISP

173
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,720
and telling them look you have to assist
us

174
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,870
police blocked IP addresses so that they
will not reach already the center and

175
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,709
the ISP is doing exactly the same is
beginning to block BIG IP address spaces

176
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:54,910
that are provided by targets and is
actually trying to get control of the

177
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,400
attack the problem is that what we are
dealing here with the highest

178
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,230
Willimantic attack is actually UDP
packets maybe 15 packets and actually

179
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,010
the amount of IP addresses to be
blocking is so big that what happens

180
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:18,000
actually that they are maybe having a
bit less stress on the Sooners that

181
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,610
actually also plans real clients are not
reaching their site so actually this is

182
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:30,179
not helping very much then the ice
doesn't you know what I have the very

183
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:39,630
very good idea what we could do actually
is we could begin to work with some kind

184
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:44,600
of access rate so let us limit the
amount of new connection setup and let

185
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,110
us any hole limit the amount of
concurrent connections to the site but

186
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,250
again the problem is that when you're
doing something like this and for sure

187
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,000
when we're talking about the volumetric
attack it will assist you alot and this

188
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,250
is exactly what happened because you are
not only disconnecting the evil that is

189
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,280
trying to attack you also legitimate
customers

190
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:20,200
so in the end of the day what happens
he'll is thats

191
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:31,420
additional advice maybe you can tell me
exactly what's on your environment

192
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:40,220
actually came out of the target was
attacked but all kind of unity UDP ports

193
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,140
all kind of TCP ports none of them were
related to any service running in their

194
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:54,320
site so actually the last advice they
got from the ice B is let us block all

195
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,330
those posted we don't need a blocked it
also I Spierer's they blocked it also on

196
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:08,040
the on target for hours and from this
moment actually the attack was over and

197
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,860
everything

198
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,309
returned to normal what we see in this
specific

199
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:20,190
attack is really deaths if they would
have discussed before the ports and

200
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,049
would have configured them properly
vetted this specific attack as it seemed

201
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:30,399
to be an opportunistic attack another
targeted one would not do any damage to

202
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:38,639
them so from my perspective just as a
side comment at the moment is that you

203
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:43,740
should always even though you don't have
yet in your organization's any kind of

204
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,409
specific details mitigation device
implemented you should always be your

205
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:54,600
network and the particles that using
very well and make sure that you are

206
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:01,080
already faltering seems like Ron ports
at the border because you know that when

207
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,220
you look at the chain from the border
router into your organization is later

208
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,889
you're doing the story as more expensive
it is because the parcels are working

209
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:15,619
significantly harder so doing something
like this on rather level is very easy

210
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,908
if you have the opportunity to get
together with you where I S B then he

211
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,980
can do it even already on his side and
it will all not saturate your link which

212
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:35,940
is definitely a very good thing to do
all of us you know we are attacked we

213
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,940
didn't

214
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,279
operate very well so we are asking
yourself what is the next think and of

215
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,509
course that it was sitting with their
experts and was sitting with my speed

216
00:22:48,509 --> 00:23:02,179
and they got the solution we need
scrubbing scrubbing devices using

217
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:11,250
delivered the protection by dividing the
traffic is spreading center what does it

218
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,360
mean it means that normally when the
traffic goes to your service at your

219
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,850
servers and you understand that you're
under attack while you're doing actually

220
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,570
you are normally connected with GRE
tunnels or any kind of specific time is

221
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:32,168
that allows you to be directly connected
with the spreading center and with BGP

222
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:37,639
advertisements you're making sure that
the specific address spaces related to

223
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:43,870
your service are routed through the
scrubbing center that means that you

224
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:54,268
need for us to all technically you need
to be aware of the fact that traffic is

225
00:23:54,269 --> 00:24:00,269
only seen by he scrubbing Center
unidirectional so only the ingress

226
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:09,019
traffic to your site is going through
the scrubbing center and not the entire

227
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:12,830
to the net returning traffic so have a
look here you see that actually as well

228
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:18,809
the attacking traffic from the botnets
and their real user traffic is actually

229
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:24,240
the same moment when you decided and you
did the BGP updates is traveling through

230
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,519
the scrubbing device what happens now
here at this stage is the describing

231
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:36,450
device is for your way but traffic and
is actually sending their you the good

232
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,200
traffic to your site so the entire Diaz
actually to have a clean pipe from the

233
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,250
scrubbing center to the site

234
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,510
I would like to take you another real
attack that i've seen

235
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,379
word target again and again you mean
target would be always the same company

236
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,670
target was again attacked by a bull
America tech this time

237
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:12,320
70 gig and as was promised by the
experts by the ice be by describing

238
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,840
service provider that is a real real
good job and they were able to bring

239
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,939
down the attack of 70 gig to 120 megabit
per second

240
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,980
an amazing job that what was not
discussed with targets and told them

241
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:37,510
that even though all describing service
providers and all the scrubbing device

242
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:43,220
vendors telling you that when you are
using them you get a clean pipe today

243
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,240
deals center

244
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,020
it is not entirely clean it is actually
still in specific remedies containing

245
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:58,820
bad traffic and there's bad traffic 120
megabit per second was too much for the

246
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,260
infrastructure so the old browsers that
they did not replace were crashing again

247
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,530
look what what a nice things right with
an amazing servers that is able to cut

248
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:18,360
down 70 gigs to 128 mega and still we
are suffering and other things that they

249
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,159
did not consider is they were actually
not taking enough bandwidth commitment

250
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,710
from the ice speed so what they did
actually there were only considering

251
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:38,130
band was related to their peak traffic
that is real traffic when you need of

252
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,320
course if you would like to tackle was
such an attack you need to have some

253
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,050
space so there were no spares and the
problem was that also the network itself

254
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:52,418
not only two routers were saturated so
what we have here is a

255
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:59,259
a very very problematic situation where
we see that although we have a very

256
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:07,330
efficient solution for scrubbing we are
not able to

257
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:16,840
taking care of the attack now I would
like to come to something we did in our

258
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:25,020
company what we did actually attacked
the customer with a very simple attack a

259
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:32,260
similar attack but what we did actually
was that we were doing it in a highly

260
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,050
highly distributed manner

261
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:43,379
meaning that actually deal mounds of
current or the connection rate of the

262
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,940
same attack from specific IP addresses
was very very low but this very very

263
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,970
little was consuming

264
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:58,790
aggregating all together to quite a nice
amount that was a joke for describing

265
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:04,760
Center ok but what was the problem the
problem was that actually describing

266
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:12,590
center as I mentioned sees only one
direction of the traffic now as the

267
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,100
traffic was coming from so many IP
addresses they were not considering any

268
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,740
of those things as an attack what is the
common solution that you all know for

269
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:31,190
years on fire mold or mildew balancers
is actually sent copies right so what

270
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,320
you're doing actually when you have the
feeling that something is going wrong

271
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,379
you are actually using a proxy for
delayed binding and you're working with

272
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:47,570
simple keys in order to let the other
side respond and then you know if it's a

273
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,080
real clients right to access you or it
is justice in attack but the problem is

274
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,929
that in order to do that you need to see
traffic into in both directions

275
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:05,090
you need actually a proxy and as I
mentioned this device you're describing

276
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,970
device does not see the returning
traffic and therefore this was not the

277
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:18,100
possibility or capability that could be
provided so here again we had a problem

278
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:25,010
that we were not able then we have a
great device in place to mitigate this

279
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:35,129
attack I would like to this page also
mention that those troubling device

280
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,929
vendors and the standard poor's the
limitations and they thought about all

281
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:45,270
kinds of solutions and the other
solutions but unfortunately none of them

282
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:52,260
are working perfect one of the solutions
is that they're actually running resets

283
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:59,770
the problem is that when you are running
resets you can get very very serious

284
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,120
problems with protocol's that are time
sensitive or services that are time

285
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,469
sensitive for example in the industry
that I was before if you have a big

286
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:14,169
poker network many many players together
and you just disconnect them you may

287
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:18,909
understand what it means it's a big
problem another thing that came up with

288
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:24,309
is actually HTTP redirects so you're
coming with HTTP and I'm redirecting you

289
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:29,190
in this redirection gives me access the
possibility to validate if the attacker

290
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,510
is received Social period is coming to
me is an attacker

291
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:39,750
it is a real planes but this is of
course also self explaining only working

292
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,900
with HTTP it's working with https so
when you're in a cell this is not a good

293
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,980
solution so they came out with other
things like out of sequins solutions

294
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,370
like so and I'll be a sequence act and
if I have a real plans on the other side

295
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:04,979
he will actually renegotiate but as you
probably know many many of the network

296
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,230
security devices are actually blocking
those things because they are actually

297
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,169
fall in the states and when they
understand that something you know is

298
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,289
not in order to just block the packet is
not going through what I'm trying to say

299
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:24,520
is that even though you're the very
expensive very good solution in place it

300
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,379
is doing a lot of good things but it's
not good enough

301
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:38,250
very very important thing to understand
is also attacks in amplification of

302
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,670
texts of the same problem that we are
actually using open sewers DNS and DPS

303
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:50,450
and again we don't see the returning
traffic at those devices and therefore

304
00:31:50,450 --> 00:32:04,509
it is also very very problematic for us
to take here i mean time

305
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:10,589
ok so after having all this trouble
after being already tired that we spend

306
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:16,099
in target a lot of eleven other money in
technologies we're sitting again or to

307
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:20,809
customers sitting again with all the
experts and got the next very very

308
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:28,109
important tip you have to go with an
inline appliance in an appliance that he

309
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:35,269
will install on site and here you will
be able to overcome the problems that

310
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:41,929
you've seen before so I just say what it
means in line in our case means actually

311
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:47,279
that we are still of course using the
scrubbing device but actually when

312
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,989
traffic is entering our site it is going
through this device that is now seeing

313
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:58,999
both directions of the traffic and is
actually also taking care and deleting

314
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:06,849
attacking service

315
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:14,249
devices have their limitations and I
would like to show now you know a texan

316
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:19,509
out of 5 will actually you see here
again the same botnets and therefore

317
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,569
it's always the same layout nothing is
changing you know it's just maybe

318
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:30,449
changing on practical level and here
again is attacked relatively massive and

319
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:40,870
again very very good mitigated on this
scrubbing device that

320
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:52,100
on the scrubbing device but what happens
actually that's the inline device that

321
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,909
was not responsible to take curable
thinks that describing Kennedy cure was

322
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:05,140
not configured very low and it did not
do the job so what target decided with

323
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,399
your network engineers ok we have to
connect to this in ninety plans ok that

324
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,379
is installed some were remotely media
center in order to adjust the

325
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:19,000
configuration to make sure that nothing
wrong gets through surprise the price

326
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,989
again investing a lot of money in good
technologies but not understanding that

327
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,750
is also important to design the network
in a proper way what happened here is

328
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:36,969
that target didn't take care that the
management was opened and instead he was

329
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:42,750
in bed and was actually needing to
access the device through the same pipe

330
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:49,350
the most commonly settle its with the
attack so target was not able to connect

331
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,190
to the device and to do the adjustments
and consideration in order to take

332
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,280
control so you see they had no other
choice than waiting until the attack

333
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,970
will over and then they could connect
finally the device and to make the

334
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,589
configuration so here again very very
important for all of you to understand

335
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,920
but acknowledges is very important that
you have to make sure that you are

336
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,740
implementing and deploying it in the
network in the right manner and make

337
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,029
sure that you whatever happens can
access this device

338
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:28,340
what targeted was again sitting with the
experience and of course understood that

339
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,490
what they have to do is to connect to
the device through the private MPLS

340
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,700
network of their datacenter provider you
may understand that when you are under

341
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,339
DDoS attack than the part that is really
problematic to access and to use the

342
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,370
public part of the internet but the
internal MPLS network of the provider is

343
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,109
not at all

344
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:50,560
impact

345
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,830
and therefore the same moment when you
take for example this is a solution and

346
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,500
there are also some other possibilities
that he make sure that no matter what

347
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,390
happens you can access or internal
devices and making adjustments and we

348
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:09,000
have to understand exactly such a little
fear the possibility to be dynamic when

349
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,050
you are under attack and being able to
change things is super super critical

350
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:27,120
another good example there is again also
pointing on architecture so again we

351
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,290
decided to

352
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:34,140
attack target now they are a very very
sure that they know what they are doing

353
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,430
so we make sure that we're going through
the MPLS network in order to reach the

354
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,509
device everything is settled

355
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:49,870
perfectly and we are asked to attack a
marketing website we're doing it again

356
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:56,000
with a very very simple attack and it
takes us exactly two minutes and decide

357
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,840
is another side of town they are all
other problems happening in the network

358
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,859
so we are with the white teen

359
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:12,369
and with the blue team we're checking
out what happened very simple because of

360
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:20,109
PCI requirements they were required to
have loved reviews on daily basis for

361
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:24,460
this fountain soon as for the only other
servers were actually payment

362
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,489
information through as most of you of
course don't have the possibility to

363
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,329
review lives on daily basis

364
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:36,690
all of them are going to the same
solution and they were actually using

365
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:43,119
the same setting up alarms which is
definitely considered back PCI DSS as a

366
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,359
company of control their own daily log
reviews that what happened here is that

367
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,710
they did it for this post front end
server and it was just you know filling

368
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,180
up the scene and they were blind so
messy world anymore of course the server

369
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:05,009
was interrupted itself but also the
security team was not able to see

370
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:08,710
anything that is going on in terms of
security in the company you may

371
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,980
understand that there are many many
people's attacks today that they're

372
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:18,119
actually smoke in order to have other
attacks running next to its and you

373
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,220
exactly an example security totally
blind ok and by the way I've seen also

374
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,848
situations today we are in the age of
big data we like to collect everything

375
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:35,289
and you also you come very easily store
to a point where you might have to

376
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:40,029
aggressive data collection that is
actually hurting infrastructure and

377
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:44,140
making your trouble not specifically on
the server that is attacked but on other

378
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:52,750
things that are inflated store located

379
00:38:52,750 --> 00:39:01,740
Mex also in this situation what we did
we said ok let's try amplification

380
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,450
attack and what we did actually we did a
fire the head of Fire Service an

381
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,080
attacking the first over with the one K

382
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:17,250
request we will not required to do too
many requests and therefore also the

383
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,810
inland device was not recognizing us as
any kind of attack and will happen

384
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:27,790
executed we were able to fill up the
bandwidth capacity with the returning

385
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,740
traffic because it was a one K

386
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:36,479
request bringing back several megabytes
per hour for each of those requests so

387
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,220
this is also very important to
understand that you might be in

388
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,029
consideration the situation that you are
reducing the amount of connections you

389
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,570
reducing the amount of the concurrent
setups but in the end of the day it

390
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,610
might be amplified with the request

391
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:04,100
return and therefore it's also very
important to consider those things

392
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,830
very very close to the end of the timing
so I would like just to mention some

393
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:15,270
other things that are also very
important to consider in many many

394
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,960
situations customers are using CDN
Solutions

395
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:26,220
Davis mitigation please be aware that
this is a very effective solution that

396
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,669
it might be very problematic when you're
using dynamic content so it will work

397
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,070
very very well for static content highly
distributed it's a big problem for

398
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:42,540
dynamic content and I would like also
maybe touch one thing that I was even

399
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,350
asked yesterday when I was meeting with
the customer many many customers are

400
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:55,110
asking about how effective is the use of
delegation so he can tell you also that

401
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:02,750
we did assimilation for target again and
we were attacking damn from all over the

402
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:07,810
world they were understanding that the
Sooners that they are provided to

403
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:13,240
customers was always relevant for
specific geographical region so what

404
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,490
they did was very very simple they were
just blocking everything that was not

405
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:23,319
coming from this region and of course
blocked us for a moment but we

406
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,080
understood what they're doing the same
as readily each experience to tackle

407
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,410
would understand and then would we did
we will just using our botnet the boys

408
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,890
in the same region and were again able
to bring them down and to attack the

409
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:43,190
servers without any problem

410
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:50,890
so let me now we just learned that if
you look at these scenarios that we have

411
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:55,210
Gulf where you see an almost done
actually very very similar things I

412
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:02,619
think the most important is that
customers are not prepared customers

413
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:08,640
like human nature think that it will
happen to others and it will never

414
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,859
happen to us and they're not prepared
accordingly and therefore what is from

415
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,348
my perspective the most important thing
before the chronologies that you're

416
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:22,170
implementing is really make sure that
you are thinking about how to set up

417
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,559
your network you are making sure that
you're creating the tools because what

418
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,670
you've seen as well as many many
situations were people were not able to

419
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,940
detect that they are under attack and
they were wasting a lot of a lot of time

420
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,690
with those kind of trouble shooting
instead of taking care of the specific

421
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,730
attack is very very important to make
sure that people are trained ok it's

422
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:50,779
requires incident response like any
other security incident and this is also

423
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:55,150
something that somehow in many many
cases not done so you're dealing very

424
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,519
well with other security attacks but
when it comes to details we were not

425
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,348
really thinking about it and I'm
definitely asking each and every one of

426
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:11,940
you to do testing so when you can use
simulation sometimes you can do it

427
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,440
yourself I would definitely not
recommend to try to get any attacks from

428
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,000
the.net so if you need then you should
really contact companies that are doing

429
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,319
that and what is also very very helpful
is to collect

430
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:32,249
intelligence in order to know in advance
what is happening in the industry and

431
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:37,609
what might happen to you specifically ok
I think because of the time will not go

432
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:42,049
through the entire cycle year will let
you just to read through it but it will

433
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:47,339
just mention identification super super
important making sure that you have the

434
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:52,739
capability to identify and to detective
you're under attack

435
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:57,920
trace back although it is not always
possible because it's very often spoof

436
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,859
to set aside what if you were able to
trace back is definitely something that

437
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:05,420
can assist us a lot if we are
understanding the origins we can work

438
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,930
with all kind of blocking techniques
understand the impact it sometimes you

439
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:16,709
know we are panicking when we don't need
and sometimes we're going we should and

440
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:21,160
I think the what is most important and
many many times not done when it comes

441
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:27,339
to do those is postmodern people are so
happy that the attack is over so happy

442
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:31,538
that the CEO and the board is not
troubling them anymore that they're not

443
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:37,349
doing the most important thing actually
talking with their teams again about the

444
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:42,489
attack talking about what went wrong and
what can we do better in order to reduce

445
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:53,449
the impact i think thats I would likely
to finish with the same sentence that

446
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:55,450
was at the beginning of the

447
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:01,879
of the presentation leaders protection
technology is far from being installing

448
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,800
forgot so whatever you do whatever
technologies you implement don't think

449
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,310
that you put it in place and you're done

450
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,620
it's the world fear it's something that
would cause the right architecture it's

451
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,060
something that requires attention all
the time and it's something that needs

452
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,730
to be dynamic because the world standard
is trying to take courses as well

453
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,190
dynamic and what I'm saying all the time
the only thing that is relevant and

454
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:34,280
security that is constant insecurity is
the change thank you very much and I

455
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,760
would be happy to ask questions
