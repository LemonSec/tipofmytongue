1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:14,240
so I didn't even start yet ok welcome to
my little talk here about web apps and

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,660
hackers and you first like to introduce
myself a little bit to you so young how

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,270
young are well

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,019
landless and extended version of my
actual passport name by day I'm doing

5
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,670
security consulting at required to left
so working for our geo keynote speaker

6
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:45,600
or in this company at least at night a
user doesn't stuff which I'm not getting

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,450
to work but more like

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:57,789
privately or I go out and get wasted or
in a bit my my fetish kind of thing is

9
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:04,729
really on Rails application so many
examples today will be based on on Ruby

10
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:12,700
on Rails but I hope you can generalize
from due to other platforms languages

11
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:21,719
and frameworks and the most fun I ever
had

12
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:29,369
format string issue in pseudo back in
2012 there are still getting emails for

13
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,630
their back where people get this actual
back as an assignment to exploit it so

14
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:43,568
that it was fun I'm on Twitter and to
step down there is just my GPG key so if

15
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,349
you wanna contact me securely

16
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:53,810
you said key ok but let's start with the
content what's this all about

17
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,689
show I've been I've been asked to give a
presentation here so I had to come up

18
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:07,880
with something I want to not only show
some patterns of her abilities and web

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
applications but more

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,400
also kind of solutions where what you
should keep in mind if you're developing

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,230
application or if yer deploying or
running infrastructure

22
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:31,670
develop us develop ass develop + 20 +
develop us develop us what's it about

23
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:40,350
coat so the audience I guess are some
who have you please raise your hand if

24
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,390
you're actively developing some kind of
application

25
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:54,500
the web application or web application
ok not too many alright so developers

26
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,950
write code and that's not the only thing
they do they get a creeper to have to

27
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,790
fix a coat off to maintain their code
have to live with it went yesterday did

28
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,179
its I guess it's hard to get rid of it
so you gotta maintain it to a certain

29
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:17,590
extent we are well I'll try to show you
some things you should keep in mind

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,269
while maintaining who called from a
security perspective so the non goal of

31
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:31,970
this talk is making fun of anyone not
even developers actually I want to point

32
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:42,590
out some mistakes trip in some
approaches to to get rid of good amount

33
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,600
of security issues just by the way
you're dealing with your codebase and

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:56,780
dealing with back reports or security
reports ok we almost had this to develop

35
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,630
a sexy now who have you kind of a
project manager product manager like

36
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:14,630
herding developers 2011 okay at least
one that's great and her activity c'mon

37
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,988
ok couple that's very cool cool so

38
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:32,020
oh my god like guys with ski mask and a
hammer to missing your computer's

39
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:39,740
actually there are certain types of
hackers the ones with the ski mask for

40
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,870
blackhead switchover real bad guys and
one with the white hats that all the

41
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,009
good guys which safety internet on a
daily basis and there's something in

42
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,099
between if you have a ski mask and
Whitehead at the same time and you may

43
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:58,810
or may not do something shady then
you're cold a great hecker so y tu mama

44
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,810
licious like had all the boxes and
gray-haired

45
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:20,360
malicious at will at somewhere between
may or may not be friendly just for the

46
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,330
problem is

47
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,948
securities hard and I mean it in a way
that this exploit does not work because

48
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:32,380
a Solaris please or you you cannot
publish sell because there's some recs

49
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,050
it cannot bypass security is hard enough
for the hackers but it's even harder for

50
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,680
the guys who write the code to defend
because they feel that way harder

51
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,560
problem to defend the whole code base
because one mechanism by which you can

52
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:59,340
successfully exploit and you need to
click closed all the box because only

53
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:08,289
then you're safe enough and still sings
Michael wrong

54
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:17,960
our passports who are you

55
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,609
does not have a passport good so who are
you

56
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:31,699
has used a password reset in the last
half year Password Reset is a pain in

57
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:39,360
the April so usually it works like this

58
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,759
ran specific example you you fill out
the form which enter you email and you

59
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,749
get a link to reset your positive link
would contain some kind of secret and

60
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:56,610
then you redeem their to create for
prompt action include the new password

61
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:05,419
or even are being logged in directory in
ruby is typically looks like this we

62
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:13,818
have our super random secure random
token and will find the user by Richard

63
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:23,999
token that's a very simply played thing
so this is how it usually done there is

64
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:29,029
a problem at least with Swiss mice
before they have to switch to my seat

65
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:36,349
for now because it's important for the
perpetrator process we just saw if you

66
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:41,039
compare number to a spring starting with
the same number

67
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:50,649
magical will return that's true or if
you if you have a string with numeric

68
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:59,269
and comparative 0 my second return as
well this evaluates to true in my

69
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:05,289
support that's almost like PHP type
juggling and we can we can benefit from

70
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:10,599
a tax perspective from this in context
of arrests applications because extra

71
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,469
mile in the older versions and

72
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:20,040
still with Jason import we can actually
give in the para- meters and numeric not

73
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,250
a string of like this one but the number
one like the pics and I'm in Ruby

74
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:34,969
terminology so to to demonstrate this
year we got a legit possible to reset so

75
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,650
we redeem before it opens very long very
secure token you could never get it and

76
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,900
you said you knew legit password and
then comes along and use the same number

77
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,480
zero which would match this token and
set the tone passports this pretty

78
00:08:51,480 --> 00:09:01,280
broken and a lot lot of ratifications
made this mistake for instance the

79
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,260
blanket safety system so I was able
without even submitting anything they're

80
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,550
coming a review board member just the
resetting renmen counts one of those was

81
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,709
review board members who like to look at
all the talks and maybe don't want them

82
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:27,260
or upload them but instead I was a white
head and told them and yeah was invited

83
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:36,020
to to to Vegas devices authentication
plugin which is very popular for Ruby on

84
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:44,780
Rails applications they had the same
problem is pretty widespread so there

85
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:54,160
was a real issue because you could read
them account and if we know if no

86
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,740
password reset the spending on any user
you would just go and type admin at home

87
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,490
would get a puppetry settling for think
I didn't do this someone prank me but

88
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,310
you could with sending a number instead
of string

89
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:14,270
reset it hurt pretty bad but

90
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:23,710
so the main point here is not only that
we can reset passports but when would

91
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,980
you blame for this

92
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:33,410
whose fault if this like it could be all
my god might equally stupid it really

93
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,219
stupid to compare strings to numbers and
do the best we have pink instead off

94
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,680
instead of just throwing error I do you
could say Ramirez from work is stupid

95
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,630
for letting me plus America and set of
strings or not telling me that this

96
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:58,780
would have side effects or the developer
is stupid because he didn't know or I am

97
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:06,850
stupid because I just close this
technique because I'm a bad hecker so I

98
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:15,460
think you can't really blame anyone but
it's it's big complex thing at ruby reds

99
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:21,900
application I mean you get web server
database the framework the program in

100
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,590
which the developer who uses all the
tools to create something and you you

101
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:35,570
have to be aware of a lot of side
effects and cannot really judge if it's

102
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:42,300
good or bad because there might be stuff
which isn't even documented which even

103
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,229
their framework development didn't know
so I would really not blame anyone but

104
00:11:49,230 --> 00:12:02,900
it's a problem so Password Reset part 2
own clout so this time PHB

105
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:10,300
their work like this so we computer
shower one of the username and unique

106
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,339
idea first of all this is not a good
random source so you might be able to

107
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,059
predict this token but it was worse

108
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:33,738
so unique I D would give you time
pre-fixed identifier which is supposed

109
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:37,579
to be unique but not random based on the
current time in microseconds and back in

110
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:42,089
the days when this was discovered what
the case that this unique idea always

111
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:51,949
target with four so then the + operator
if you add admin with + to the 34 F

112
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:57,289
something it would evaluate to the
number for that again would be cast to a

113
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:04,149
stream of the number four and then put
in 2010 the year globally working and

114
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:10,379
only poplar trees at this point of time
what the someone hash of the number for

115
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:16,189
unless you use a name started with a
number but that's ok sweet we can ignore

116
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:29,738
so yeah that's pretty fucked up and I
mean if you're using PHP you should be

117
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:34,279
aware of at least of this type casting
racist because that's documented quite

118
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:43,189
well but yeah retaining passwords so
another reason way a pound or Password

119
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:48,379
Reset serious when I application I use
you look at the authentication

120
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:54,109
authorization parts first so much
patrice it is crucial creature which can

121
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:59,199
allow an authenticated access to
application and therefore if you're

122
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,689
developing an application with a part of
recent special care should be taken not

123
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:09,819
to screw it up too much or not to screw
it up at all at least so it's quite

124
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,789
something completely different

125
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:16,620
just another possible crease it

126
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:25,770
this is again remain rails coat this
used to be artistic taste challenge I've

127
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:33,660
put up this recent mechanism is verbatim
copy of their password reset making this

128
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:42,699
in discourse which is like online forum
thingy and I reported this and use this

129
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,560
accomplice in mice challenged still
gonna spoil my own challenge here if you

130
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,260
don't wanna hear it played yourself you
should leave the room but please stay

131
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:05,000
here so it's it's just a bit complex so
we try to find the user by its receptor

132
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:16,170
open and if we don't find it but it
still doesn't match we safe we don't

133
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,740
find it so we go to the adultery and we
pull out the user I D

134
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:30,780
out of the parameter out of the session
and then we find that user and then if

135
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:41,760
we have a yeutter here we can reset the
password problem being here if we we got

136
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,500
it free

137
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:53,180
we look at them in the session so we can
say which which key in the session has

138
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:02,599
will be used to find our user and that
there must not be password reset over

139
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,010
but it could also just left open
yourself to open a string which may or

140
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,020
may not start with number if it starts
with a number and we pull out this year

141
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:20,150
left open here we just say instead of a
token token we say she ever understood

142
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,280
token and make sure your excellency
acceptable in the session starts with a

143
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,220
number because we can start on the
website

144
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:35,459
they would give the final method would
cough that bring to a number and we plan

145
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:41,300
to use up with the idea of whatever or
CSF to start sweet typically you money

146
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,040
used to number one because then you get
the admin account then we could reset

147
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,410
admin password nice thing is we don't
even need to trigger an email

148
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:04,329
22 generated token because it is
completely out of recession so again it

149
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:13,750
was it was a bad bad brave 22 hello

150
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:26,760
session value by using given key at this
point there fix was actually to prefix

151
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,530
this session parameter with properties
said some things so with a pic string so

152
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,639
you couldn't inject arbitrary values at
this point anymore that was like the

153
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,940
main part of their pics but what do we
learn well that's what we said stinks

154
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:55,530
because it can break in so many ways it
could also be that your your tokens are

155
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,490
predictable because you don't use your
not being a good friend source just by

156
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:06,690
accident but the problem is we needed
people forget their passports a loose

157
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,830
here may be there

158
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,939
keychain files are they get Brandon
don't know their property months ago to

159
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,169
reset it because they go shopping on
Amazon

160
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:26,970
well that's a problem but actually it's
just an example for the whole problem

161
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,720
space because building security
applications and not only web

162
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,350
applications is really really hard

163
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:43,439
you just start by myself started coding
some tiny upload script and I was like

164
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,950
what's done in a minute mister director
adorable that's not good I didn't do

165
00:18:49,950 --> 00:19:07,940
this for my way would I even tried to do
this so the problem is why why are you

166
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,919
so mean quite why do you do this to us
if you wouldn't tell us it wouldn't be a

167
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:22,840
problem that well yes and no because
someone always will

168
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:31,600
will kind of you and if the white-haired
guy which touchy about it it will be

169
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:40,039
that was a ski mask and he will not tell
you but he will report to database be

170
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:45,080
even more mean them the guy who
disclosed to you so in a perfect world

171
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:52,120
everybody discloses like a great he
doesn't even want to search for it so I

172
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,100
could run a bit about background his
entry shirts and Hall of Fame this year

173
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:08,240
but no so 444 develop our part if you
get a disclosure of all it's something

174
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,090
in your index and then why not what's
next

175
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:22,240
well thank the researcher you may give
out a t-shirt or a background to at

176
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,250
least credit because

177
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:35,980
fame well you could do this no no that's
not good because you wanna you wanna go

178
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,050
a bit deeper

179
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:45,560
try to understand what being brought to
you because i text you you get by

180
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,580
getting a responsible disclosure or a
security alert from from a third party

181
00:20:51,580 --> 00:21:01,409
who just got free consulting or kind of
a small free audit and should be

182
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:08,840
thankful and tried to to find the root
cause what went wrong there can we can

183
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,970
we included test for this role in our
continuous integration or unit estimates

184
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,380
of this will never happen again and we
don't have to give out a free t-shirt

185
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:26,690
again can we can find other instances
got a report that this did not see so we

186
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:35,390
can fix even more dismal benefit
security wise from report and she should

187
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:41,720
really feedback and tell whoever
reported this you could you verify this

188
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,680
is fixed now because you might just have
pics which isn't a hundred percent

189
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:57,820
correct on working so you might have
just another clinic please make sure

190
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:07,460
that you fix kind of bulletproof and the
most important to learn a bit about the

191
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:15,950
issue and improve because he just got
free knowledge and improve your area

192
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:37,040
code and your whole infrastructure or
code based upon it so another example

193
00:22:37,040 --> 00:23:06,550
project in order to keep track of
changes you made to the good so this

194
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:14,270
week he has a search method this is Ruby
code again but not exactly railed but

195
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:22,450
that doesn't matter we this is where I
already searched and this very moment we

196
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:30,390
can control the rest not at this point
this will be passed to the shell and

197
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,350
invoke get grabbed good well what do we
see here

198
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:43,379
well this options just assume it's had
put here and ready for its all Querrey

199
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,890
and we have here and there a so this
will him she'll end up as the good way

200
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,830
to call xxxx like you learn you
shouldn't just have long string with a

201
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:02,419
sharp mind because they can come along
and put some clothes on your back to $4

202
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:10,320
a break at the lab records put into
commands so this way off shall medical

203
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:22,310
attention in the case here but which is
quite underhanded often not we can

204
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:28,500
inject arguments to get grabbed the
actual Querrey

205
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,330
will become an argument starting with
the best and the ref will be held so we

206
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:42,530
we will have to search time being had
instead of whatever is supposed to be

207
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:49,430
searched for so by consulting the good
grip man page we plant the option desh

208
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:58,400
below which stands for open files and
pager so the actual vulnerability and

209
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,220
the actual exploit for this was to do
you search for a desk whatever so come

210
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:15,000
on too long you could even put in some
form that can become the cops coat so

211
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:25,630
you could show you could put a complete
command line was funny because they saw

212
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,860
we are safe here because we are not
allowing

213
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:36,010
director spot them they weren't aware of
the full spectrum of what is able to do

214
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,610
with it

215
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:43,840
argument so the problem is in mint
signaling which is not to up your

216
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:58,870
speakers here and makes them the same
command line and death where this came

217
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:07,110
from so it all looks nice but in the end
you forgot one little thing which then

218
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:28,500
is the disaster in terms of security
right so so there were an exercise we

219
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,450
have seen several way so it could fail
like being predictable or by possible by

220
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,570
a number instead of string because
mexico's weird how to improve

221
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,240
so can you read this

222
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:51,510
no ok basically this is Kip Lak

223
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:58,730
the AV LaBrie of Android right off a
dark reports it states the state read

224
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,030
back to them so you'll have heard
upstaged by the way you busy could see

225
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:10,000
if you could read it here is like a
whole page of commit just about integer

226
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:19,910
overflows like enable into checking in
to hear small non non exploitable itself

227
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,950
there so it looks like when when stage
fright and this application example but

228
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,830
still when Wednesday's fred was reported
to together a team that I guess I got

229
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:41,500
into jello flows we never check for this
let's let's just go nuts about this I

230
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:47,300
guess they learn something and I hope
they keep it up because you you should

231
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:53,159
you should if you learn it martin get it
because then you wouldn't make the same

232
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,090
mistake again you should try to
generalize issuers I said before and try

233
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:04,790
to find the pattern which you can
somewhere use to find other instances in

234
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:11,430
other parts of record and other projects
and you tried to play it to whatever

235
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:22,150
you're maintaining in order to get rid
of this type of issue of back even

236
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:31,420
better maybe a treat this like ours as a
car full disclosure is that just told us

237
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,970
this morning in the keynote so have a
good source of information where you can

238
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:42,250
find examples of their abilities which
then you should take

239
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:47,860
understand and think about them is like
what this means is somewhere in my code

240
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,090
or can I can

241
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,270
check for this type of issue even before
it introduced because someone in the

242
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:02,680
team my made this mistake and if we got
to test for this never happened that you

243
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:09,180
can commit because the test with hillary
was when I got my bad I'll never do this

244
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:18,830
again and probably well this brings us
to tools so you should try to find a

245
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:26,970
fitting tool chain for your project for
your location in order to to have good

246
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:37,070
baseline of security scanning in your
build our testing process that is true

247
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:43,250
for a perspective of a good framework
for automatically find bucks and pops

248
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:53,740
over there that guy who will tell you
about his two tomorrow so he has them

249
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,870
back but generating generating machine
so but I want to focus on the voided

250
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,929
machine but beware

251
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:12,730
well pool with the two still and I don't
know if anyone remembers

252
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:20,400
OpenSSL in-depth rings a bell rich and
if you remember that one

253
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:29,280
ok a couple of you so pick in 2006 a
Debian maintain no was like ok OpenSSL

254
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,418
quite important piece of code all around

255
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:37,429
automated scanning Caldwell ground on on
OpenSSL

256
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:44,679
complain about 11 initialized arrival
and we'll tell this maintainer hey look

257
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,009
there's an uninitialized variable that's
not good

258
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:57,690
ok the maintainer said well let's just
inflated and commit this security

259
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:03,039
improvement or whatever and they will be
compiled in every Debian and Debian

260
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:13,489
based around the globe from 2006 and in
2008 someone figured that this mistake

261
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:18,149
was made because actually the variable
head to be an initial list in order to

262
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:22,959
contain enough entropy for the key
generation in OpenSSL like every RSA key

263
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,369
was basically just depending on the
process idea of the process which

264
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:35,340
created it and any additional randomness
yeah so we had we had a pretty pretty

265
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:50,439
nice tight key space and could just
generate every possible age or X 509 get

266
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:57,639
every possible RSA key giving space
which was created by a debut in between

267
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:06,049
2006 and 2008 it was pretty pretty bad
so lesson learned

268
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:13,649
try to a very fair want you to tell us
it's just a bit computer which tells you

269
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:16,619
what to do but you should tell the
computer what to do that's right way

270
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:23,939
around i mean if you ever had a web apps
can are running on a web application get

271
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,169
a five hundred pages report and your
whole being told you to verify this that

272
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:35,250
for injections tough and durable

273
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:48,290
but yeah so don't trust it widely
another thing this is an example for

274
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:59,780
building an application or whole
landscape around it so that other day I

275
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:09,440
was hoping on get help because they have
a really nice security program so get up

276
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:19,220
as something which is basically looking
at your age but keeping imprint and then

277
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:27,780
pulled out you use out of their database
and omissions if you made with their

278
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:37,120
excesses report or not so it would if I
connected get my essay to get a look at

279
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,550
my key and see I want to clone top three
pool but I may not because it's private

280
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:53,110
and so I think of it as a super smart
enough to get shall well yes so the

281
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,600
front end AFE stage picks up the SSH
connection looks up some stuff about you

282
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,820
which is signal

283
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,110
environment for rival and then it would
start the second stage process process

284
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,418
on the same host to the actual back home
where the report is she want to clone or

285
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:19,250
a pole or somehow excess and i figured i
messing around with my username on the

286
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,360
weapon to freeze I could inject
environment variables to that second SH

287
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:30,760
process because somehow got a favorable
which equals

288
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:41,280
so polluted the environment of it was
able to inject new lines in my username

289
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,919
and introduce new environment troubled
by this so

290
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:54,699
that what the actual payload 22 XE make
the second decision process on a shelf

291
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:01,609
for me on get up to come so I preloaded
lipstick route because then as the sage

292
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:08,210
the USA to the Big Ten process with
think I'm running as root cool I cannot

293
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:18,099
excess flesh ruled . as age and I i
sorry I need to ask for a password

294
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:23,990
because actually one running as food so
then I said I just a variable in order

295
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:34,689
to treat guests aged well ended up in
the visuals that could just type

296
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:52,119
whatever amount wonderful yet what I
call like self-contained issues for

297
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,619
instance

298
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:58,400
injection or a buffer overflow you can
you can just seeing the code it there

299
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,720
its if you used to read code is yelling
at you and saying hey look at me I'm

300
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,098
gonna ability but sometimes it's even
more complex because you have

301
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:14,430
environmental issues you must see
whatever you are running on your servers

302
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:23,470
or somewhere in its context it's running
in influences obviously the whole

303
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,609
application in a way so you should from
time to time credits which the

304
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:35,470
perspective on what you're developing or
even if you auditing stuff you you get

305
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:40,250
better results if you tried to change
perspective not not only looking at

306
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:47,890
blocking procedure but also what types
of a pass to the back and maybe

307
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:54,230
something I haven't even thought about a
bit more

308
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,270
open mindedness helps a lot

309
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:10,230
well okay so I'm coming over actually

310
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:18,750
optional actually I just would like to
find out trade trade to be said to be

311
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,450
the attacker yourself if you're
developing application and tried to

312
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:29,680
question a bit what written there is
usually do they look at codon question

313
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,950
every single statement every single line
in order to find a flaw and think about

314
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:41,410
threat so we we got a threat here this
week Skywalker and we get our asset

315
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,940
which is the Death Star and our asset
the Death Star has a small tiny security

316
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:53,640
vulnerability flew in and blew up the
whole tests are so we got threats and

317
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:02,359
what is next to threats models yes more
like this blueprint so we got threat

318
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:10,619
modeling it's great to have two guys
which are a developer celebrate their

319
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:20,880
hands does polling on their coat ok if I
come back next year I want to see all

320
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,840
your hands up it's really helpful
because if you have kind of a blueprint

321
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,390
of your exit which in this case is
whether it's pretty value target you you

322
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:40,140
should try to i mean you only can give
you points I can explain the whole way

323
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,950
of removing runner but you should try to
decompose your application the way it

324
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,689
makes sense to keep it a bit modular and
to get a good overview and identify

325
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,130
where are my boundaries especially made
my trust boundaries where where where

326
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,150
where does it stop

327
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:08,070
enticed where the threads by drawing
more or less abstract picture of your

328
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:14,260
exit or application and crying lines as
boundaries she would almost instantly

329
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,020
see what are the threats you might have
to think about it about it a bit but you

330
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:26,580
would see where can they happen and how
would then you gon get threat and then

331
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,080
you're not done because he repeated over
and over again

332
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:44,170
yes and no security is being processed
for a for a former laced approach on

333
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:57,330
this you would look up Microsoft SQL or
strike threat modeling I wouldn't

334
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:03,009
require anyone to just plain hairstyles
braids but adopted in a way that fits

335
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:10,560
your needs because everybody develops
like microsoft does not there to stop

336
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:22,570
the youth themselves so over and over
again that's like the biggest problem I

337
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:28,650
see is that people don't learn from
other people's mistakes and the same

338
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:35,530
types of bucks popping up over and over
and over and over and it's 2012 and we

339
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:43,670
still that format strings explode
performance rings and stuff like that be

340
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:51,880
pessimistic for a moment where does this
happen people are people and maybe they

341
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:00,160
must fall on their own in order to see
what the actual problem is people don't

342
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,819
learn that's bad for for for the product
for the software for the whole landscape

343
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:14,710
it's good for me it's job security for
me if every now and then a new crisis

344
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,180
gripping gets introduced to us up I have
two tests I'm happy I found the back and

345
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:27,710
I get back together well but we should
fix this like once and for all and error

346
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:38,570
there are well there are approaches to
start XP computing from scratch like

347
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:55,370
colonel not written in C or yet
approached accede to be realistic I

348
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:03,370
wanted to point out they made it through
so to be realistic

349
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,980
dumped here don't just try to learn
never stop learning

350
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:18,450
try to learn from the mistakes and
repeat looking at your cold doing doing

351
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:27,669
yourself and try to get a bit of mind
said you can do to you have and you can

352
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:36,140
afford or can put in there so that's my
last flight thank you for your time

353
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:46,339
my accounting here said jerusalem done
if you have any question I don't know I

354
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,980
don't see the next year so other
questions

355
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,630
okay thank you
