1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,439
we know that if tomorrow guys always
catch ahead of the militias clothes or

2
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:10,550
malicious behavior and the chechen make
it invisible so that's why I'm here we

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,560
highway how to make you will read it and
today I would like to share some of my

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,179
work I started when a musician John
Mayer senior threat researcher at his

5
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:33,079
word I would like to give a brief
introduction about a sofa / 04 / EC one

6
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,620
of the kids department I too so for us
here where have we heard a lot of people

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,050
chill defined detection and where do the
cutting edge research and we do the big

8
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,678
data analysis and above all we provide
protection and respond to our customers

9
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:59,129
around the clock so you may ask me a
question is how do not here around the

10
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:15,560
clock for the day but

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:36,140
and Australia as where we can work
around the clock and we have worldly

12
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:44,869
100-200 developers to recover this
threat research response system

13
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:56,500
developed world and the detection so
yeah and if you're interested

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:08,060
sure or system development you are
welcome to contact us

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:17,180
so this is a general introduction and
while those guys are technical fouls and

16
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,770
there was a structure and there were
discussed which includes

17
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,010
with you you are anything which is
terrible today Fisher not really

18
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,470
accomplished and the second way is about
you know those guys because PDF sure to

19
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,180
put a search engine echoed

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:51,860
it's about you know PDF conversion
another pro differ by the time so

21
00:02:51,860 --> 00:03:02,200
everyone knows that I'm sure everyone
here we used every day and it's very

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,239
popular and also because it is
independent of operating system and the

23
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:14,750
plate wall and we will get a PDF from
your friend your email box you feel less

24
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:24,110
suspicious and actually and also Acrobat
PDF reader has also fallibility aside

25
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,500
and the so that you know open tomorrow
writers because it's flexible to talk

26
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,890
with the PDF reader so those are the key
reasons why they are talking about and

27
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:42,040
even though you know we're used to PDF
every day but you might not have a

28
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,530
chance to know the structure is just
just just like you know we travel across

29
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,209
but we don't need you don't have to know
that the engine what he is what he is

30
00:03:52,209 --> 00:04:00,549
under the bonnet so saying here PDF
today I took a chance to have some

31
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,540
questions about a PDF structure we risk
it to the highest four sections header

32
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,739
which is simple and then followed by the
Body section which is a group of objects

33
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,940
stored in Arundel order and then
followed by the cross-reference table

34
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:25,390
there so you can see that the hardest
question mark

35
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,909
percentage PDF and I just got a version
number is questionable and then this is

36
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,910
a main part which is aboard section
which is a collection of objects stored

37
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,380
in there are pre order so the operation
and if you know a lot of time selection

38
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,880
there i read a dictionary lame number so
and also

39
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,520
people you know like to use futures to
compress or encoded data to make that in

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:03,919
less readable this is especially common
in our

41
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,730
the third section across the face to
just use a very important because this

42
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,500
table will tell you and the offset of
issue object that's why the object and

43
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,490
order but because he in the cross
referenced table you know the opposite

44
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:33,600
of the issue and the index table yeah
and also the first caller difference is

45
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,950
offset of that particular object from
the beginning of the second one is the

46
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:48,740
generation number of different issues
just correct it has no modification

47
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,130
third generation number will start from
zero and in the cross reference table

48
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:01,030
the first entry will always start with
offices here and there was a huge

49
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:22,070
increase in number that ends and means
and means not you so how many objects

50
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,630
and then to the route object where to
start and if you differ has been

51
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,610
modified before you you were having a
slashed wrist which to your the previous

52
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:39,550
cross-reference table officer and
started actually are you this is a cure

53
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,180
what you know that keyword you will see
the offset British offset of the

54
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,289
cross-reference table and then this is
power

55
00:06:52,289 --> 00:07:02,878
ok let's start with the first one is the
beauty affair which is a single page and

56
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:10,800
it has a list and it contains a
destroyer over she points to some

57
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,569
malicious or promotion website and we
noticed that all those kind of those

58
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,110
kind of recent efforts are made it
happens a lot just two companies like GE

59
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,240
sure that the ex-royal more so let's
take a look at some numbers so you can

60
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,869
see that you wanna go two or three
sentences and you have an increase in

61
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,399
the middle and if you move your mouse
over the next few seasons emission

62
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,860
regulations are different and that is
very encouraged to come to the promotion

63
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:51,840
upset all and yeah

64
00:07:51,840 --> 00:08:00,599
so if you're a reader will pop up a
window saying that I go into it and I'll

65
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,430
just to proceed royal you want to block
this and also you have a checkbox to see

66
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,880
ok you want me to remember this action
like you know what mister black mister

67
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:17,320
so if you allow it will open the pros
and they just in a direct you to the

68
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:25,000
website so you might wonder who's going
to and why does go through the deficient

69
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,860
in the Pro different account just been
taken just for the deficiency in the

70
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,650
email and it is easy of course but
there's a reason I'm going to discuss

71
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:42,549
later so if someone named Candace a loud
and proceeded it will you know in this

72
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:50,359
case you just you know don't know some
of which contains content so we can see

73
00:08:50,360 --> 00:09:01,230
that it was actually kind of name gonna
exists we should serious so many options

74
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:15,110
now it doesn't doesn't exist anymore so
if you're lucky you're so yeah we were

75
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,910
just you know just ask why don't they
can just put in the plaintext no it

76
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:30,480
could do that but the public is let's
talk about the email fishin because the

77
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,800
difference in our here in the email you
have the option really

78
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,890
and you have more information so it's
easier for the area around attracted

79
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,920
attention to the doctor because you
haven't but in the previous example

80
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:55,750
because you know it's hard to banister
force poised to run for office next to

81
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:02,519
you so you have to keep that is a
challenge as why they were deficient in

82
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:09,940
the PDF and also it has tapped into the
Internet so be careful so the main point

83
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:17,860
is to know who would actually the victim
$2 tomorrow or to the remote ok let's

84
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:39,889
have a look editors noticed the simple
demo

85
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:50,329
this is the memory book

86
00:10:50,329 --> 00:11:02,069
example your exploration company and a
movie almost over this link you can see

87
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:12,319
there and then another different
shortening so they're more but you know

88
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,729
sometimes in life you too

89
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,910
so let's just take some time to look up
this winter wonderland and ask you you

90
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,100
know you want to proceed or not so I
just made this country does not exist

91
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:38,500
you for sure how long time so if you're
lucky you can you know sometimes just so

92
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,019
here we see that you know this

93
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,100
hopes up a warning window and they
kicked us folks and encryption brought

94
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:57,370
it will remember you action at least
wrong but we need to have ideas so you

95
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:03,160
can allow it will open up around and try
to download some stuff yeah I didn't

96
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:15,410
connect to internet so i think is a
second the coast is more interested and

97
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:24,569
engine poisoning or you can also see is
a black hat Search Engine Optimization

98
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,979
so basically this slot directly attacked
humans

99
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:37,360
director but his direct attacks search
engine Google border and other engines

100
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:45,690
so of course was there for the city
engine and when human Europe such

101
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:52,410
injured you look at him so the typical
of this kind of my race is only got a

102
00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:02,699
single page again and also because the
one true in a website or so in this kind

103
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:08,870
of bar is it is a sign of specific
operated cure was like you know that you

104
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,750
must molecular penetration and they were
later and

105
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,190
it has some links to other similar pages
is called you know

106
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:27,060
creation in two other that she is a way
to improve the city engine score and

107
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:41,130
also at the end of the power it has a
set of my we were no more you know PDF a

108
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:46,710
nice different graphs and they know some
text you could take a closer look

109
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:54,920
just two or three years religious
analyst especially in this case is a ban

110
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:06,699
retreat authorities for national duty
and so you have free access so you can

111
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:16,740
see that in the crowd so here you have
different interests which actually

112
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:25,910
extremely and i said im a change this of
course but today the typical say he's

113
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,770
just kind of flower

114
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:37,250
cure ya so if you take a closer look you
know there's not really a complete

115
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:48,180
you know to make it clearer he was so
how does this issue results look like so

116
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,989
what do some sushi are you going

117
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,100
didn't realize this year they can over
into the banner a trader Austria and we

118
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:06,670
noticed that here we go to know 47
results if you are a deal means

119
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:13,740
advertisement letting us positive
attachment on Google number if you want

120
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,230
to promote a website in a relationship

121
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:25,360
any products and you want to promote its
kind of action based in our system so

122
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:35,130
the more you pay the high ranking you
will get of course the city engine at

123
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,660
1200 the parameters as to why so many
people intend to improve decision engine

124
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,010
school together results on the top so
those this section news opposed the

125
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,540
search result using the free and also on
the right calling also good response

126
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,579
which is set and use the free search
results will call organics issue with us

127
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:05,160
so you don't want to pay more for the
search results you have to have

128
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:14,420
concluded that the top people won't see
that so we see here you see it that you

129
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:30,849
don't want to talk you know that those
other PDF related results so it's not a

130
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,379
suspicious

131
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:38,439
bueno tradus you know once will not help
on this issue and we will contact you

132
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:49,219
and agree that this is a problem so
where do they live and they will notice

133
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:56,949
and you can see that as a result number
of drops dramatically to elicit a half

134
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:06,970
minutes from ya so what are the last bus
most we've got less than half so yeah

135
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:17,799
you could get a good job and to improve
the results which is good so I just you

136
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,769
realize you could if you could just grab
bracket which has a PDF is sad because

137
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,138
you believe this is a PDF file and so
you have that kind of subject ya Banat

138
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:35,570
region and if you click that link
directly to the promoter of said yes to

139
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:42,120
to your hot making out how to become a
long day you know I'm sure if that works

140
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:57,658
I never tried but if you are taking a
close look at iraq and if you kick the

141
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:07,470
arrows to the cash option that will
surely the Google Voice content because

142
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,299
here that this is actually PDF file
which you know who off the Curious

143
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,740
Village on the specific topic

144
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:30,960
so remember to use aging just bought in
this option and enter data and yeah so

145
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:48,250
you can see that Harry Potter by a bunch
of objects so who believe this is a

146
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:57,370
video file so you might wonder you know
the correct your fondest which were

147
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:05,020
directed this website so we can also
easily Texas by yourself and you can see

148
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:31,710
that just read a redirection change so
it starts from the promoter

149
00:19:31,710 --> 00:27:26,330
there try to hide

150
00:27:26,330 --> 00:30:44,080
so so so so so

151
00:30:44,080 --> 00:32:44,000
because everyone

152
00:32:44,000 --> 00:36:26,589
so

153
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:39,359
so that's what we saw here but after you
know actually just been changed to the

154
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,989
computer PDF file which had been dropped
into the system and then it will put up

155
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:52,890
a note asking if you click on anything
that doesn't respond you have to connect

156
00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:17,259
ok so you know the member you'll see
that actually just inject the show

157
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:23,109
according to the memory and they can see
that the memory usage is increasing just

158
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:31,900
now he's a 305 just go out to about 800
600 because they that this just goes up

159
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:39,369
dramatically and in this time which was
launched ahora war but he will you see

160
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:54,469
that later so I'll always try to treat
sitting in the PDF reader and injectors

161
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:58,630
share according to them and hear you say
that this is a hard worker so this just

162
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:04,539
showed that it just works perfect so
what I'm going to do is to take another

163
00:38:04,539 --> 00:39:24,610
snap shot and see what has been changed
in the system

164
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:35,360
anything except tables and chairs so
yeah why not really true it's been

165
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:48,050
exaggerated but you know we do a lot of
stuff but I'm not surprised and english

166
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,760
is really good

167
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:58,940
yeah so you today if it on a symmetric
me because I didn't go to the party last

168
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:06,980
night and I didn't get drunk so so yeah
I think the timing is perfect ok the

169
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:20,290
snapshot finished ok we can close this
difference will assist children up shot

170
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:42,660
you can see it drops the computer just
called and potholder because he in there

171
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:49,279
it'll be PDF reader just introduced us
on the books in some direction in this

172
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,740
case which has sent a box so the drop to
the PDF are you listening books and 26

173
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:02,850
successfully by Pastor sandbox and then
also drop some other trooper wish the

174
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:08,860
dot year and out troops so let's take a
look at what would happen to her
