1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
hello I'm not sure I S and talk about
stuff I'm a member of tools and tool is

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
the open organization of luck trigger
sweep a clock for a sport so we open

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,049
looks without keys and without force
without damaging it and we have actual

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,689
competition for some competitions are
internationals ODIs championships and

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,920
everything if you are trying to pick a
lock for sports star couple of rules you

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,019
should abide by at least that's how we
played one young pig lockstep you own or

7
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,879
you have explicit permission from the
actual owner that you're allowed to pick

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,040
that and if you can help in any shape
way or form

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,010
try to refrain from picking locks that
Yuri lawyer at some point you will fail

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,129
and then you may be open or close your
friend or your server room or whatever

11
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,489
that's a problem so if you live by those
rules

12
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,030
probably will not get in trouble for the
more I am a active member of hex 42

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,369
space in Arnhem we we reside and defunct
German military base report on Google

14
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,150
Earth has also and when

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,870
today at the American blog did a tour
through Europe to look at a car spaces

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,220
they also visited us and their first
line in the article was like wow this is

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,910
the most awesome space ever and of
course I can only agree to start off

18
00:01:23,910 --> 00:02:40,069
like talk will start off with a little
video

19
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:53,659
show of hands who thinks this is a good
idea i think is a cooler here I think

20
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,819
it's a cool idea it's a neat idea but
well I don't know I mean you put your

21
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,138
keys in the cloud and God knows where
what's gonna happen

22
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,250
well the funny thing is this an ad for a
bill your insurance company that does

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,439
this on the side so at least if your
house guests included afterwards you

24
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,638
know who's going to pay for it so that's
a good thing but you did see that they

25
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:18,669
put a key on it turning pedestal and
basically UK with a sort of connecting

26
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:26,359
me they took a 3d render of it and from
that 3d thing and why they had to do

27
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:31,780
this is basically because they Belgium
and Belgian Asus we all know part of

28
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,669
Europe which is not in the USA and costs
in if you are in America are you

29
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,280
basically if you want a lock on your
door you have a couple of choices that's

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,239
a Kwikset thats shake that's very
expensive so that's three choices and

31
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,970
basically as a residential area you
probably go for option one or two so we

32
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,439
have a quick sale which kind of limit
your choices down so what you can do

33
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,388
with that she don't have to put your
keanu turning pedestal and make a

34
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,430
complete 3d render for it

35
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,370
one picture can be enough and as you
company does that well you did that I

36
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,750
don't think their existing any more than
what they said just take a picture of

37
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,849
you key on a white background just not
on click made it to us give us $5.00 and

38
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,419
will ship you a copy of the key to your
home address

39
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:29,639
well personally I would not use my home
address for that return envelope but but

40
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,570
the ideas need i mean so it just takes
more picture click go right and actually

41
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,570
watch some interesting software that
analyzes your picture so they don't make

42
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,699
a stupid do put the picture you said it
was first figures out what the actual

43
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,659
key years and then it starts looking at
where did that should be and what he did

44
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:56,479
to actual is what you see at space
number one this one this one you see

45
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:08,289
dead red line is a bit higher than the
actual keys this is not good did nothing

46
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,810
branded so they viewed the red line is
actually a bit hard any actual keys so

47
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,520
what they did is they figured out the
type of bread and Turkey and what the

48
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,810
original code was so they're the gap
there is wear and tear of the key so to

49
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,139
call you receive in the mail

50
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,710
probably works better than the original
you sent them I think it's neat I think

51
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,888
it's cool right so he just making
duplicate duplicate of you keep by one

52
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,880
picture I need both sides but the idea
remains the same you can do it with one

53
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,320
there's actually other companies who
expand on that same idea this is out

54
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,380
books they were running in a belief in
Manhattan state can be scaled it will

55
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,380
cause what they do is basically they are
reversed Millman refers physical snail

56
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,880
mail so they show up at your door

57
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,870
take your paper mail it take you back to
their office they scan it and email it

58
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,830
to you electronically so even if you're
not at home you can reach us ban will

59
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,260
probably be that out but I'm not sure
about that so what they say they need

60
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,710
access to your mailbox at least so what
they say again send us a picture of luck

61
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,150
here are a few people and of course
there are several places where you can

62
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,250
have your mail that's in a mailbox
outside maybe that's not locked so

63
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,089
they're they're easy and if there's if
there is a lock in your mailbox don't

64
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,589
need a picture of that key if that's
behind the gate with friends cause

65
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:40,340
that's what

66
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,729
do they need two decades as well and you
have several layers that day didn't want

67
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,479
to go into your house probably because
its American and wanna get sued or

68
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,530
reliability or whatever so they say if
you have your meal if you have a

69
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,530
slitting your door number of us who
they're so you need to be in behind your

70
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,440
front door to actually direct mail will
supply you with in mailbox you can put

71
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,729
outside your door but the idea remains
the same I mean so you need a picture of

72
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,750
a key and they make a copy of it and
then they actually use them in their

73
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,690
business proposition so i i think thats
cool taking pictures of keys are making

74
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,110
good that's nothing new does not new at
all in 2008 the University of California

75
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,360
was playing with this device it's a new
camera on a kickass lands what you can

76
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,780
do with big lenses just take any
pictures you mean a bit that's a

77
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,229
terrorist is a table under terrorism the
table this book and the book is icky and

78
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:43,490
that's assuming you can legally do men
with big lenders what you and of course

79
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,830
we can see that key its focus on that
one

80
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,810
the picture is not taking straight on
but that's not real

81
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:57,330
no problem if you look at the hands of
this key this one this looks like a cake

82
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,570
you know you like you know that's a
quick and fun part about a quick said is

83
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,980
we know what what the dimensions of that
he is especially from that had caused

84
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,090
that head is the same for all the quick
says of course the code is different but

85
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,650
if you say few people on distorting and
changing the picture I mean that's

86
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,250
clearly not picky but if you keep on
wrapping it until this is the correct

87
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,960
shape than you know this is the correct
shape as well which you don't candy coat

88
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,650
to the actual coding using code that
works so this happens from

89
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,929
really just need a big lense and this
was 2008 and has improved CCTV proof

90
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:44,779
that happens now example this is a
picture shot by Ray Ray's remember as a

91
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,279
deficit basically tool in Germany

92
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:57,439
shame but this is 2009 it hard for you
how to raise he likes and cause he's a

93
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,390
lot bigger but he's he's especially
interested in animals we know discuss

94
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,390
and he did bring this key is a 3d
printer key of the German handcuff keys

95
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,380
and cost the handcuffs t-shirt German
police are all alike

96
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,050
well both of them are the normal police
they're all keyed alike and if you think

97
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,990
that for a second you might go that
stupid you think for a bit longer to

98
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,780
actually make sex with if you get
arrested by coupling one which ended in

99
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,510
IndyCar and Russia off and she left the
station has you over to another club

100
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,500
it's quite needed he can open your costs
a device that's gonna hurt so yes thank

101
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,260
you to like in most countries test case
and Ray was in this big event in the

102
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,650
Midlands and his dad big that we
actually have policewoman about Dutch

103
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,380
police but of course Arabian Radio was
like the lips

104
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,160
instantly recognize the name and brand
of the handcuffs that the Dutch

105
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,329
policeman's will vary and the German
costs our lips also seems like it

106
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,998
on the touch as well so he went to this
police officer and said their police

107
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,949
officer used to ski in your house he
turned his back to a massage turned his

108
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:22,170
back to him so which clearly gave a
vision of official on the actual period

109
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,378
he was wearing well I'm not saying again
make a key from did picture was a bit

110
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:33,220
blurry a bit less blurry here but you
get the idea but I can see this is a low

111
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,420
high low and high yes

112
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:44,868
compare that to the original he did we
already have not seen it is the same

113
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:49,779
here but you can kind of get estimate
that it is i mean that is information

114
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:55,509
leak is just waiting about you he gives
away quite a lot of intel and a bit

115
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,509
later he tried with another company said
yes she'll go ahead and yes it works so

116
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:06,279
this is actually the key to all Dutch
and German police handcuffs and the STO

117
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:16,720
you can download and print your own
example this is what I call a typical

118
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,040
clean desk environment it's a mess but
of course me being a lucky I see a key

119
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,759
we put a car in there just for scale if
we know to scale we can do stuff with it

120
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,879
we guessed that this is a cabinet key
west there's a cabinet underneath that

121
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:39,319
desk you that we have open and well it's
it's it looks like a cheap he because

122
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:45,839
it's cheap we we can assess that is
probably has weird tolerances so we can

123
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,369
we don't have to be exact so we did if
you print out that picture you just to

124
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:57,129
take a picture dad on you you don't have
to you don't have that's distorted image

125
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:01,309
anymore so you can you just need to size
it so that the cornice to correct size

126
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:07,899
and if you then printed on paper and put
a paper on a sheet of metal and just cut

127
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,549
it out

128
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:11,990
go all kindergarten on it and stay
within the parameters and follow the

129
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,779
lines which some luck

130
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:20,050
you'll have at least you have a medal
shaped piece of metal with roughly the

131
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:26,529
same shape if you put that in some local
open that will open your Kevin let's

132
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:36,230
just make the key but this is so this
works on absolute crap relax and talk

133
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:47,120
about gridlock this is a TSA approved
luggage lock these are to launch this

134
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,889
once a center doesn't matter I'm not
bashing the Brenta just talking about

135
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:58,850
the idea this lock this number luck
that's yours this one looked at actually

136
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,259
execute its not yours that's what you do
not have a key for this this is a

137
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:11,540
built-in back door lock was what
happened after 911 especially after 11

138
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,589
years a if you fly to offer on the USDA
wants to look in your package that's

139
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:25,959
fair but if so if you lock your door
locks if you look your bags they need to

140
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,638
go through those allegations just start
cutting the locks to get in that people

141
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,370
find that annoying so some companies
like travel century just a logo they

142
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,410
started making and selling locks that
had built in back doors that was to

143
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,910
feature just a backdoor quite quite
certainly not hidden his just plainly

144
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,240
backdoor what happens to use a has a
couple of keys nine to be exact number

145
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,220
to claim state of them they're so did
you say officials just takes out his

146
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,259
number two he opened it and then he did
there is a paper trail and so they can

147
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:03,720
go through your locks through your
baggage without destroying the locks so

148
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,449
there are nine piece that can open all
the baggage so if you have media reports

149
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:16,829
with these kind of pictures I should
like come on guys

150
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:23,179
well I can't you see which number is
which but that's about it and well and

151
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,439
then again

152
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,600
having an internal document from the tea
is a leak on their external website

153
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,520
because well because of rules and
databases and god knows what this is

154
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,210
dead-on quite easy and of course if you
own deadlock you know what this distance

155
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,490
is so you know what the scale of that he
is and because of internet and

156
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:53,050
information of course this 3d printers
and these are the keys to all the better

157
00:14:53,050 --> 00:15:00,469
and of course those are not high
security locks are not well maybe except

158
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,590
the number six

159
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,530
that was made by Havas it's actually
quite hard to pick the other ones I just

160
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:12,620
stick anything in there and goes these
are actually printable again

161
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,790
downloadable dare bring your own that's
what we do share information so I mean

162
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,709
like I said it's not a high security
lock but it gives it tries to give the

163
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,460
users some sense of security which i
think is false

164
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:36,280
it's it's it's sheel had best I can and
see this evening so I refuse to travel

165
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,900
with these locks I just use your zip
ties I use we advertise that probably

166
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,439
are not in possession of other people
per se at that moment and so I use it

167
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,320
all has asked you to show you not as a
deterrent just sealed and it works and

168
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,930
put some spares in the box and most of
the time to use a just a place one of

169
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,920
the spare time I know how many pairs
ahead so it works thats my security

170
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,099
another example

171
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:12,900
April 2010 some media attention went to
this idea apparently you were able to

172
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:20,959
buy a key a master key so not just the
key but the 2d to all

173
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,820
New York substations subway stations
only $27 a must if he means you can open

174
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:37,360
so not just travel 300 shut it down if
you have access to technical cabinets

175
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,290
and god knows what

176
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,180
so action doors fire exit all that kind
of stuff you can open it of course it

177
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:50,859
being post 911 @ it be indefinitely in
New York the idea was to get hold of

178
00:16:50,860 --> 00:17:03,100
this case he so by stating that de jugar
shouldn't have this by that act actually

179
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,620
given it to him and just in case this
picture is not high res enough to

180
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:16,169
actually read that he did put it on a
map with a known scale so this is given

181
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,250
it away any locksmith should be able to
cut a functional keeping this in mind

182
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,650
you this is 2010 when this happened I
give a version of this lecture every now

183
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:34,440
and then and last month to month ago was
in Los Angeles doing this and what are

184
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:43,750
the questions was a change these locks
are no 1 I'm not in New York so you

185
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,250
don't have to ski well I do but

186
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:56,000
but then again rule number one you can
only pick locks if you own or you have

187
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
explicit permission you will it's
probably out of the question so I don't

188
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,200
know I have no way of telling it until
last month when this article appeared as

189
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,590
$1 all of a sudden and of course they
had to print that freaking de full-size

190
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,730
otherwise the message doesn't come
across so people describe it out and

191
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,200
actually if you go to the online version
of this article and twinkled a bit with

192
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,690
you or you're out you get this picture
which is 300 dpi higher s definitely

193
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:43,600
enough to actually do that I mean come
on feel if you try to skim cards you can

194
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,280
go off and see on it and and make
plastic add-ons that look like the real

195
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,430
deal and to hide all your height lol you
or your electronics that's quite a cool

196
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,680
but there are there are better ways to
get it let's watch video

197
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,820
let's bring NBC Bay Area's investigative
reporter be waiting he seems

198
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,649
unbelievable that one golden key
so-to-speak unlock so many pumps we were

199
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,670
surprised to ride you could call it the
key to the kingdom it is a remnant from

200
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,370
back in the day when all gas station
pumps were made with the same lock to

201
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,850
make it easier for inspections and
maintenance now those keys or just

202
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,790
providing easy access to a very
lucrative crime using high-tech

203
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,690
technology and in the end we are all on
the hook hidden behind here

204
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,490
a new Bluetooth enabled tomorrow they
can rip off your credit or debit

205
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,990
information in second universal gas pump
key is making it even easier for thieves

206
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:46,399
to install these new skimmer that's not
a good luck I mean the bidding is quite

207
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:51,879
obvious but I also know now exactly
which blank to order that's why 11 USA

208
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:57,490
which cost about 50 cents on a know if
you buy them in bulk of course I mean

209
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,129
having access to books that you
machinery is in a box and you can all

210
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:08,320
your your your key loggers and crap
where dole put inside a box and didn't

211
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,820
look like the real deal it's the real
deal it's the original box nobody's

212
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,689
going to see that it's a fake because
it's not the figures inside so has one

213
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,490
key for all those guys poems does make
sense if UD engineer has to do maintain

214
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:30,309
all the stuff you don't want to trade
off key issue 11 so there is always a

215
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,519
trade off and I think this is the wrong
trade of course when it goes wrong when

216
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,120
it goes wrong it goes wrong in a bad way

217
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,320
suppose you live in new york new york
has a lot of buildings which are high

218
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,439
and so you're thinking about a fire in
New York when there's a fire in one of

219
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,700
those high buildings you definitely want
to fire people to get into your building

220
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,559
one way of doing that just don't like it
or not the best option or give them the

221
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,620
key but then again who your big place so
if you if they would get the keys to

222
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,209
those buildings they would need to
separate truck too so that's that's

223
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,610
that's it goes for every truck but you
never know which troubles the first one

224
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,860
there so you have to double everything
so what they do is to have basically

225
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:23,229
tiny tiny boxers I need votes outside
the building and they put the key to do

226
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,820
building put in that locker put in that
tiny photo and those roles those are

227
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:35,840
cute like if you do it in a wise way I
put some extra large room there is a

228
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,699
monitoring on that box at least

229
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,309
all hell breaks loose when that is
broken open so there are a couple of key

230
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:49,730
just a handful that basically are the
keys to the city of course these got DDD

231
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,429
sluts get caught by largely and some
locksmith they get out of business

232
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,960
because of age or whatever this is this
is a locksmith who who used to cut those

233
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,480
keys and he went out of business and he
had some leftover stock

234
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,139
well the apocalypse might be coming
because the New York Post reporter just

235
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:11,709
stupid legitimate story and intrepid
reporter for america's third done as

236
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,990
paper is paradise slightly disturbing
item for sale and he be a locksmith

237
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,220
Daniel told the undercover reporter in
New York City fireman's caring for $150

238
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,559
the kids give the owner of the ability
to control elevators circuit breakers

239
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,529
subway entrances and traffic lights all
over the city they essentially become

240
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:36,240
the key Maker from The Matrix Reloaded
media being media every now and then you

241
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,659
see an original story but both have it
is a copy of a copy of copy basically my

242
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:48,539
keys so other media outlets start
copying the same story every new post

243
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:56,389
actually dead on pictures
whitebackground useful definitely on the

244
00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:00,039
media how does actually copy that again
and they added information this morning

245
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:10,480
actually these are the keys to the
electrical fire out of ADP also works in

246
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:18,950
high-rise important stuff scary stuff
that's the firemen service Kiwi Kiwi we

247
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,049
were talking about traffic lights turn
all the lights red to know the right

248
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:31,500
green remembers the movie billion fire
alarm box set so sound different sound

249
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,110
the alarm or don't sound the alarm when
you actually fire so yeah I mean you can

250
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,120
create chaos with this he said

251
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,290
and of course the only way to get the
story across this by giving out free

252
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:52,840
apparently this is the logo space in
Amsterdam

253
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,020
packing and while I'm a member of 42
which is really a different space also

254
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:06,820
in the Netherlands and being a it is not
a rivalry spaces is a bit more like a

255
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:15,389
simply and 12 siblings do write all in
prayer and love and and stuff like that

256
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:21,809
decade got a new space at some point and
of course with new space you lock your

257
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,399
keys they were very proud of of their
new space in which is also absolutely

258
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:32,100
and so one of our members which is a
regular troll started calling one of

259
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:41,000
these guys like 20 K lock your on your
new facility we have a member in in our

260
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,669
team that knows his logs so if you can
just send a picture then we can assess

261
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:53,049
if it's a decent you're not and they
showed up in the mail box

262
00:24:53,049 --> 00:25:03,399
well it's not very clear picture that I
do

263
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:13,359
if it was a high-powered laser to
actually be there

264
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,559
outline of what the key should look like

265
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,849
so we hope that up on our newest machine
we happen to have which happened to be a

266
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:26,519
later got a good thing it wasn't a
coffee maker question would have been a

267
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:33,059
mess and what you see happening is it
just learn step outline of a piece of

268
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:39,479
plastic piece of plastic milk thick so
dad will never fit or at least it should

269
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:46,950
never be home so that was the label now
it's burning we do have some ventilation

270
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,060
now you just gotta sheen's North won any
of those fumes

271
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:59,590
so you end up with a basic outline the
key which does not hate you people but

272
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:07,500
it is amazing so what you can do with AD
wait for the actual learning

273
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:14,540
see there you go

274
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,220
we set up a bit too hard burned as a
shadow but this is the actual shape the

275
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,510
key we kind of assess what what what
what the blank was by just by looking at

276
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:34,820
it so this is a plastic into a normal
key quarter here is a bit of see-through

277
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,620
plastic that's a normal blank you can
just do it that way you're used to

278
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,729
and didn't work or not as I was not a
member at that time I put in the sense

279
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:52,570
that rule number one stop by Locke no
permission but being a header space

280
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,970
which is all information wants to be
free we put this video and all the specs

281
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,640
on our public wiki of course that's what
you do right but some people freaked out

282
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:12,120
its sole foreplay show today after we
showed up with it should look eighty

283
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,669
copies of the keys so you can
redistribute that they said we have a

284
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:22,740
good luck you can't get into a door
again who supplied you that lock

285
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,780
I became a member and even gave me this
congress well you didn't give have to

286
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:41,430
give me any good who all right let's go

that is it on

295
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,000
there's a power as any of our mailboxes
convinced there is a political

total bust

302
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:16,300
did help

303
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:27,290
you can go out tomorrow on another
matter

304
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,850
we got a lot

305
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:38,340
it is it coming

306
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:49,428
actually don't get the story apparently
you could buy a lock with the key that

307
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:57,059
was coded I like this is election weird
so apparently if you buy this log its

308
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,440
default go to to factory reset was
issued which is always to say and these

309
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:09,980
guys who installed it changed that's
leaving default password as the best

310
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,039
board game that's exactly the same as
they did so it's weird but well I didn't

311
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,500
want to buy those locks with those keys
I just want to assess if I can make a

312
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,610
working key from

313
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,740
still so we got from that moving video

314
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,320
well we got this one

315
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,809
get some info but not all the money we
got another one

316
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:45,190
let's think this is a money shot it's
kind of straight on it kind of gives the

317
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:51,389
shadows are nice but conceded depth and
if you lower your locks that this is a

318
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:56,969
quite peculiar shape heading you know
you like to see that's a big ass that's

319
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:04,230
because it had only one I know that has
these had well so again because has as

320
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,659
the standard had their standard size so
we can see what the rest of the key

321
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:08,309
should look like

322
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:14,100
actually this is the style sheet for a
big in the head should be here he's

323
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,209
already positions are these other
possible deaths so if you keep looking

324
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,460
into this picture and compared to that
you can kind of get estimate what what

325
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:32,269
the actual debt should be right we came
up with this so we guessed and bone

326
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:38,480
assessed based glue that suggested we we
think these this is the block to all the

327
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:46,639
buildings weekend but of course come
pick it was only a half explicit

328
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,519
permission from the owner to actually
try that

329
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,700
well it's probably out of the question
right so what to do so we bought it

330
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:02,610
right and and yeah it works so we at
this is actually the key to all the

331
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:10,639
others became so we're talking about
pictures of keys that that's a bad thing

332
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,990
but actually having hauled off that key
for split second that's the golden

333
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,110
ticket right so we can do stuff of
course you can run to take up shop and

334
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,158
cut but there are ways to protect them

335
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,899
i mean one ways if you look at the key
way and there's a certain were in your

336
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:36,949
key way if you get into it with that so
make magnets worse and you patent those

337
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,109
forms or not some other people are not
allowed to sell he should look to say

338
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:47,289
and if you use a family's weird shape
and only use that for your installation

339
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:51,279
it's going to be harder to to get
fitting pieces of metal who going to

340
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,019
look normal you play nice but then there
are buses like this this is a key

341
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:01,519
quarter but it works in another
direction basically this is a dream

342
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,340
machine

343
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,840
thousand dollars euros or whatever and
some money how how determined you are a

344
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,099
decorous for sports like figure doesn't
investment which we made it's it's a

345
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:21,099
cool machine it takes slopes of dress
look like this smiley face is always

346
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:27,090
good what it does it cut skis but a
normal P Carter would go in that

347
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,428
direction and duplicate that this one
takes those groups and duplication those

348
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:41,539
whom you see it just Mills out these
groups and so you end up with a blankie

349
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:46,169
that you have to put on another coffee
machine at the sides and then you open

350
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:52,700
end up with a working he is fine it's a
very expensive rail duplicate keys but

351
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,389
if you have that's hard to duplicate
home buying mobile service get the

352
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:03,939
blanks this is a way to go

353
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:10,950
soldier our attention

354
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:22,560
that saudi riyal how are they made their
care and so if you can make a cash offer

355
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:33,089
a medal if you can make a few key which
will hold it if you can make a cast of

356
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:40,119
your key you can pour medal in their
right stuff and you can go quite fancy

357
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,129
but it so we we try to hurry chief said
apparently this is just regular play

358
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,819
later replace it

359
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,220
we went to the hobby shop on board the
plane basically to figure out what it

360
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,319
correctly it takes on research and
figure out what it is but if it's if

361
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:06,070
it's if it's too solid then it won't and
if it's too soft in a little bit so but

362
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:14,280
come on and then there's a piece of
metal that we haven't figured out

363
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,960
actually what it actually is because
that's a fairly very low melting point

364
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,450
is not let post it will be unhealthy but
it's it's it's whatever and we just try

365
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,689
to have a normal quite good keynote
high-security one but it's quite normal

366
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:36,609
average ki Bari one of her friends on
his kitchen table just like try their

367
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:43,630
first time and it's doing it even works
with that if you go a bit more high

368
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:49,920
secure than that claim probably won't do
so you need a a a material that

369
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,540
basically has a higher resolution than
normal clearly what we found out his dad

370
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,529
your dentist used a two component

371
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:07,870
booty basically to take impressions you
teeth that's awesome stuff it's it

372
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:12,779
doesn't melt or shrink when it's heated
or cooled down so that's what caused

373
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,200
that would be weird when you're you're
you're P would be four different size so

374
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,109
that's good stuff it's quite expensive
though so befriend a dentist as always

375
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:28,710
you end up with stuff like this that's
the original key and you can imagine I

376
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,970
mean is not high security key but it's a
different he actually to talk after my

377
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,950
talk will be about case like this on a
normal key duplication machine

378
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,939
the one that normally cuss like this is
gonna be impossible to do with that it's

379
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,710
just a different type of machine and not
saying it's a better lock but it's

380
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,330
different and so enormity quarter won't
be able to do this but of course you can

381
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,450
and if you take it out of the mold
carefully without destroying that more

382
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:06,970
than you can retry the mall still intact
you can just melt this one and redo it

383
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,700
and then you're golden

384
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:15,060
you can keep on doing it over and over
this actually works we try this another

385
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:24,430
one this is the idea of the program we
have no idea what if you were to judge

386
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,100
he would have known a shared the most
well-known hacker of benevolence he's

387
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,680
basically one of the driving forces
behind that we're not using computers to

388
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,390
vote in parliament these days which is a
rope and he founded our first commercial

389
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,450
public

390
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:49,259
I just be so he's one of the good guys
and he's a hacker so he knows his

391
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:55,460
operational security thing these guys
knows risk profiles he should he should

392
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:04,330
know better than he should public

393
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:14,180
genuine

394
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:22,859
you should always

395
00:38:22,860 --> 00:39:29,039
she's taking part in cherry

396
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:38,089
wrong with this picture

397
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:47,380
add-on there's no chance in hell

398
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:53,559
actual key double beaded key to see
cabinet lock this is just a key happened

399
00:39:53,559 --> 00:40:00,299
to have in his pocket and he showed it
to the camera you didn't know that it

400
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:08,619
took nothing away from the story to lie
to this guy has excellent operational

401
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:13,499
security to journalists happy cuz he has
footage is happy because it is still

402
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:17,948
there you didn't know it was a fake is
just a prop so she cute is not

403
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,339
compromised story you still there

404
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:25,679
he's not showing he's not showing he has
to go down there other ways of not

405
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:31,179
showing keys is this is Shay KeePass no
air Keyport instead term is actually

406
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,839
basically a box it you sleep your keys
in and out of this one is Brandon death

407
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:44,538
on 22 and that's what I like what it is
it is a box so we can boot USB thing is

408
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,599
in it but it's about two keys that you
just slid in there so it is basically an

409
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,559
intricate way of keeping your keys in
your pocket and so you only slide him

410
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:59,099
out for you use them so nobody can see
them if they're and so what they do

411
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,559
don't cut your keys but they said you
the blanks with this so they need to

412
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,749
figure out what your actual keys are so
of course what do they need they need a

413
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:18,799
picture of your key so you're selling it
to DEFCON 22 attendees who are paranoid

414
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:23,669
rightfully so and you're selling it to
the prepared for their cause they noted

415
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:27,109
don't have to show the keys are you
asking them to send pictures of their

416
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,940
keys that's wrong

417
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:36,490
well for granted in this small print it
says for extras at added security you

418
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,629
should maybe a blind

419
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:45,180
the actual teeth are you lock but that
should not be be added security c'mon

420
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,828
guys just selling a security product
that should be the default it should be

421
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:55,720
the only way you can upload pictures of
your keys come on carrier so we did

422
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,029
figure out that this is probably not the
best idea of the world's right i mean

423
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:06,980
post it should not be on consoles should
not be passed on that nothing happened

424
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:14,329
so this is wrong right well this is a
website call police break . what it does

425
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:19,839
it's basically a Twitter feed grabber
and every time you tweet a picture and

426
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,270
say new house and keys in debt tweet it
gets added to this site so we have and

427
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,060
of course these are all click through so
if you click on one of these pictures

428
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,940
you will get the key to the house which
is in the picture is probably do you

429
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:42,740
text right and if it's not I'm pretty
sure someone can write a Google Street

430
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,379
View add-on that can grab pictures and
compared to that we only have to look at

431
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,069
Turlock which I have no idea how big
this city is but this is doable and you

432
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:56,470
have access to this guy's Twitter feed
so you probably know when he's only day

433
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:01,770
and he just bought a new house so it's
probably filled to the brim with new

434
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:11,369
shiny toys come on this is given away
don't do this is wrong so like I said

435
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:16,369
showing pictures of keys is wrong but
then taking pictures of keys are having

436
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,740
pictures taken while using it gets
harder and harder if you happen to live

437
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,618
in London you're surrounded by CCTV cabs
that's basically what you every time

438
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:33,050
right and of course there's Google glass
will we don't see that often but I mean

439
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,619
something like that will have full fare
already look at it

440
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:44,279
look at it you are not dating recording
it and we all have 3d capable cameras in

441
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:49,009
a pocket right now we will DOS tracking
devices are cool camera or telephones

442
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:55,839
but the cameras as well and their high
res enough to do this stuff so when I

443
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:03,880
was younger and we we we stopped using
gas money basically and we did it was a

444
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,869
TV series that basically showed us if
you're pitching in your PIN code for

445
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:17,170
your plastic money shield your numbers a
pin code key is basically you coat to

446
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:22,380
deadlock so don't show it to shore up
doing it in a video when he actually was

447
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:30,069
operating that elevator he didn't see
the key in the clear just got one more

448
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:35,660
sale and it was done so that don't want
to keep you away from the drinks this is

449
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:41,558
a bad guy is actually a killer I know
that cuz he got convicted for killing

450
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:47,289
people he went to jail for killing
people and he walked out of jail because

451
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:52,390
the design of the master key was printed
on front of the prisoners information

452
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:58,180
and a copy of the offset book was given
to all inmates upon arrival of that

453
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:07,390
facility so I know so she can be hard

454
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:13,009
as security can be easy but for some
weird reason is always quite easy to

455
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:19,180
forget oh so let me any questions I'm
gone
