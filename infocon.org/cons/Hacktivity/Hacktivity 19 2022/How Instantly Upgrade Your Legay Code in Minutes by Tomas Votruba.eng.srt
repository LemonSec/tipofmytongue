1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,220
ladies and gentlemen next presentation

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,840
today is Mr Thomas

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,320
okay thank you

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,380
uh I welcome you to the least

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,780
uh security talk on this conference

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,580
uh

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,939
it will be mostly about instant upgrades

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,560
because that's uh that's what I do and I

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,699
would like to show you how instant

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,439
upgrades are actually related with the

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,920
security topic

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,600
uh I came from Prague from Czech

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,500
Republic

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,760
and my field of focus is mostly PHP

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,680
uh can I ask with somebody here working

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,379
with PHP

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,800
perfect one to two people good so

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,079
basically this talk is generally about

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,200
PHP but the idea is rather about any

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,140
language that can be analyzed or parsed

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,539
so at first I have a confession to make

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,140
I'm like no secret expert so don't take

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,600
any security advice for me I think I'm

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,619
the least

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,960
skilled person here including all the

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,740
stuff

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,360
but

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,080
my focus is software reconstructions and

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,479
often with the software reconstructions

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
we Face something that's very old and

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,799
broken and maybe in a way insecure and

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,560
our job is trying to make it more modern

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
stable and useful

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
uh

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,159
can I maybe ask you like just about the

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,960
language of

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,640
somebody from JavaScript area

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,840
or go

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,119
or Java

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,460
or c

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,659
is anybody here a coder

42
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,280
good good so what other languages that

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,799
you work with usually

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,060
C sharp okay

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,680
Java hit

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,899
so maybe like from C or C sharp there

47
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,380
will be something related with AST

48
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,258
uh with any language that you use we

49
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,540
usually face something that's uh

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
I released in a new version especially

51
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,140
in PHP we have this release schedule

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,020
that we have a release every year maybe

53
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,260
something that's similar in in Java not

54
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,160
sure

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,500
and this is actually a screenshot from

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,780
the last conference I gave talk before

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,099
covet

58
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,680
and in that time we have this like red

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,540
versions that are not secure you should

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,239
not use them only if your business is

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,340
making a lot of money then it's safe to

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,239
use them

63
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,500
uh and this is screenshot from today

64
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,900
and if you compare them in a three years

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,019
basically all the useful versions that

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,260
were before save seven three are now all

67
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,220
red

68
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,940
but I think only people only in this

69
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,260
conference care about it like most of

70
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,420
the clients they just don't care if it's

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,220
red or green just if it makes money it's

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,660
okay

73
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,879
and not only that but on the languages

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,280
we have Frameworks so there's another

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,459
level of complexity and code that can be

76
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,159
a legacy and again this is

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,500
something from the previous year and

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,840
basically all the versions that were

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,720
kinda legal the phone Port 3 are now

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,519
forbidden in three years so in three

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,900
years basically we'd have to rewrite

82
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,480
everything just to feel secure

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,819
so how to deal with this

84
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,620
well you can hire some like security

85
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,560
expert or upgrade expert or somebody who

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,739
knows how this language Works what's

87
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,480
unsafe there

88
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,319
and soon you will realize there's a

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,640
little bit more technologies that you

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,860
use and you need export for every single

91
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,920
field and every area and it does that's

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,420
quite costly and I think that's why

93
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,760
companies decide not to do anything

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,260
until it really breaks

95
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,120
so this is a saying from coding area

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,819
basically once you start coding the

97
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,319
thing that you created today the next

98
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,420
month is already deprecated or not

99
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,819
useful anymore

100
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,700
and you need to rewrite it or upgrade it

101
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,298
but I think the same is going with uh

102
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,220
security and the knowledge once you

103
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,919
learn something here

104
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,680
you go back to your company and you will

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,180
have to change the stuff that you learn

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,320
here

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,100
and that's great but it's also pretty

108
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,259
time consuming so the bigger your

109
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,740
project is and the more you learn here

110
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,840
the more work you will have tomorrow or

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,340
on Monday

112
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,979
which is annoying

113
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,240
so

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,660
another thing from security is uh if you

115
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,340
make it complex enough maybe people will

116
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,880
not find out

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,680
but the same applies

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,139
if it's too complicated and complex we

119
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,759
are not able to understand it and we

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,139
cannot change it

121
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,320
and that's okay right

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,660
so we stay with this Legacy projects

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,139
that are huge and boring and hard to

124
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,240
upgrade and we think it's okay

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,460
so I wonder how can we do it better

126
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,979
apart educating ourselves in the

127
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,400
conference and trying to apply the

128
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,460
knowledge in our home project

129
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,860
uh we can use some tooling I would say

130
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,800
like do you know Snick

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
no snake Okay good few people so

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
basically snake is

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,300
very friendly tool that will help you to

134
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,699
discover security issues uh in your code

135
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,860
base you just run it in your code base

136
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,740
and it supports many many languages

137
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,840
uh I don't know which one because I

138
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,539
don't use it and uh

139
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,820
it finds some patterns that are insecure

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,759
and it tells you you have problem here

141
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,800
it's not that big problem but this is

142
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,419
kind of like security issue you should

143
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,160
fix that so you can actually put this

144
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,860
tool into your continuous integration or

145
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,500
deployment and you can find out how many

146
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,360
problems do you have

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,759
and this is not the only one you can you

148
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,620
can choose from many many tools like

149
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,759
this

150
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,560
and this is a

151
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,020
this kind of like core of this talk you

152
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,600
can automate the knowledge

153
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,580
that you find out here with a tool

154
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,318
that's like public publicly available

155
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,180
I would say like this knowledge is not

156
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,460
in the minds of the people but it's in

157
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,720
the tool so instead of teaching all your

158
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,460
colleagues they shouldn't do that you

159
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,039
just put the two into the CI and if the

160
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,460
CI fails they will know it's wrong and

161
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,080
you don't have to discuss with them in

162
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,819
the pull request about like if they're

163
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,699
secure or not because uh it will be red

164
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,460
and they will have to fix it

165
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,380
and that's something we actually apply

166
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,840
with uh with our clients when we try to

167
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,720
handle the upgrades because upgrades are

168
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,919
in a way making the projects more secure

169
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
so instead of doing it manually

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,539
if a client comes to us and asks us Hey

171
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,020
Thomas we have this 20 years old project

172
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,840
and we want to uh

173
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,860
let's say go for IPO or sell it but the

174
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,960
client is requirement we have to have a

175
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,080
secure version of PHP and servers and we

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,599
have this 10 years old PHP and they will

177
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,060
not buy it what can we do

178
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,400
so we try to help them to automate the

179
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,099
whole upgrade process because basically

180
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,020
making the project more secure or making

181
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,500
it upgraded it's just

182
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
a way of changing the patterns let's say

183
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,479
you have cross-site scripting it's very

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
well defined pattern that you can find

185
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,880
out and you can fix it

186
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,300
so if you make it a little more

187
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,599
technical just to

188
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,500
uh

189
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,960
give you idea do you know what's

190
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,900
abstract syntax tree

191
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,199
good good okay so basically uh I'm

192
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,639
working on an open source tool that's

193
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,520
running on abstract syntax tree and it

194
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
just just briefly who doesn't know it

195
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,560
goes through the code and it finds out

196
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,560
okay this is a class and it has these

197
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,500
properties and it has these types

198
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,840
and it can look for

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,840
alt code or insecure code

200
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,419
and if you know how old or insecure code

201
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,059
look like then you know how the goods

202
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,399
and new code look like so basically this

203
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,919
tool is defining

204
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,260
pattern refactoring

205
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,260
that you say this is a and this is B and

206
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,540
this is something I think C has

207
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,440
something like Clank Mr that's also like

208
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,459
this automated tool and I think

209
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,920
JavaScript has something like this so

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,060
there are many languages who already

211
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,800
have these tools and they are mostly

212
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
open source so it depends what's your

213
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
specific language

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,480
uh and what you need to do is like this

215
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,820
the language has to have the parser of

216
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,620
the code then you have to have static

217
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,959
analyzer the PHP is 10 and then you can

218
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,600
combine together and make it nice for

219
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,980
people to implement their own rules

220
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,160
okay now I'll show you very little demo

221
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,860
very little because there's just very

222
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,380
few uh PHP Developers

223
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,380
so I'll try to make it uh

224
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,540
short

225
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,560
external Mirror Mirror okay

226
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,199
I'll try to make it uh does this work

227
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,660
yeah can I change can I change to this

228
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,079
microphone

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,099
check check okay good thank you

230
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,140
okay okay

231
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,940
for a few seconds

232
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,620
hey

233
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,940
ah this one yeah

234
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,000
do you see it or should I yeah in the

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,140
back also

236
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,180
yeah good okay

237
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,320
let's see so basically this is a

238
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,540
in PHP have this dependency manager it's

239
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,640
probably in every tool in every language

240
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,300
you just ask for the dependencies that

241
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,260
your project

242
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,200
use this and then you have some tooling

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
that you can use to help you to maintain

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
the code to test it and so on

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,839
so Rector is basically just one of the

246
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,279
packages that you can install and uh

247
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,279
then you can Define in the config

248
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,279
just very briefly uh what path it should

249
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,459
scan and here you have defined rules and

250
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,680
this is something like uh the snake

251
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,540
that's using the ASD that I showed you

252
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,500
before

253
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,839
there is a specific rule that looks for

254
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
certain patterns and if it finds it then

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,860
it will change the code

256
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,439
so I have a just very simple

257
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,959
example how it looks like here we have

258
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,100
some

259
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,220
let's say alt or insecure code

260
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,779
uh

261
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,940
the thing is the thing I like about

262
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,100
automated refactoring that actually I

263
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,160
have no idea how the insecure and bad

264
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,620
code looks like because I just create

265
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,899
the rule or Community creates the rules

266
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,779
it becomes part of the set and then you

267
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,660
can use the set just to like make your

268
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,740
code better

269
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,180
so actually

270
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,279
a lot of Security Experts can connect

271
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,860
put each their own knowledge and then

272
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,000
you can use the knowledge of our

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,620
community

274
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,839
otherwise you would have to have it all

275
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,320
in your head

276
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,420
so here are some annotations you may be

277
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,000
none of them from java this is in PHP

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,339
it's still like comments so it's very

279
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,839
lousy

280
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,180
but in a

281
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,940
in a newer version

282
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,279
we already have a like proper proper

283
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,680
annotations like Java

284
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,100
and to make them change to a new one and

285
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,839
again this is this you can apply on a

286
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,120
hold code base so

287
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,019
it's as fast as your like software or

288
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,180
CPUs

289
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,899
so you can run it on the code

290
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,579
let's see dry run first

291
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,500
so if we run it we will see what it

292
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,000
tries to change

293
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,160
so this is something some in the older

294
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,440
or insecure syntax and it will try to

295
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,660
translate it into like better one

296
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,959
so if because it was a dry run it's

297
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,600
still not applied so now we run it

298
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,060
without dry run

299
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,920
we can see the goat

300
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,800
so I think

301
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,300
yeah

302
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,540
as you can see it transforms the code

303
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,160
and you don't have to have specific

304
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
knowledge about the transformation and

305
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,720
you just run the two with defined rules

306
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,459
and as you can see there are more rules

307
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,360
so more stuff that to be converted so we

308
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,779
just can enable more more sets

309
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,180
and

310
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,200
just let the tool handle the job

311
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,420
let's see

312
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,060
okay so now we have everything this is

313
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,100
supported from the next PHP version

314
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,860
so not yet so we have everything that we

315
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,720
can in our current version whether it's

316
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,540
PHP Java C C sharp

317
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,120
the most upgraded as we can so we don't

318
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,459
have to think about

319
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,720
learning what's new in this or that

320
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,779
version and so on

321
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,959
okay so that's for the demo

322
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,800
okay yeah

323
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,540
thank you

324
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,220
check check

325
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,480
I'll just do this

326
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,660
okay so uh

327
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,000
this way we can apply the tool whether

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,980
it's vector or something in your

329
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,740
language or Community but we can also

330
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,160
put it

331
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,500
no this one we can also put it in the CI

332
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,180
so let's say

333
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,100
some new bug is discovered and put into

334
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,800
a wasp and you don't know about it yet

335
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,380
but if you're using some tool that's

336
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,360
uh

337
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,880
implementing these security issues and

338
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,279
putting them into your CI

339
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,320
you can run it on the CI and you will

340
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,360
know about them as soon as possible and

341
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,040
not only you should know about them but

342
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,399
you can run two in your CI and let the

343
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,940
let the code fix for you of course the

344
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,180
merge and check is up to you but the big

345
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,440
Advantage is that you don't have to

346
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,940
check it yourself and you don't have to

347
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,620
worry about it

348
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,459
and that should be it

349
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,860
if I get there yeah okay thank you

350
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,019
[Applause]

351
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,240
it doesn't work yeah

352
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,100
uh questions yeah

353
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,399
yeah

354
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,620
thanks uh how does that recommendation

355
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,260
goes in the pr process so is that a code

356
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,620
suggestion or is that an output that you

357
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,480
need to go back to your workstation and

358
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
fix it there uh it's up to you there are

359
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,000
two ways like uh in in GitHub actions

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,680
let's say requests you can have like

361
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,660
these annotations that it will like

362
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,120
comment on your code which I think is

363
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,220
useful with tools like sneak they will

364
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,019
just plug them in and they will tell you

365
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,760
oh this this could be this could be

366
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,579
problem but uh

367
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,440
we actually tried this approach but most

368
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,300
people prefer to just have the

369
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,839
suggestion right in the comment so

370
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,000
basically you send a pull request and

371
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,339
instead of the tool forcing you to go to

372
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,920
your computer and fixing everything it

373
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
will propose the fix with the commit or

374
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,240
request to your request so then it's up

375
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,420
to you just to click or decline

376
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,180
cool and then I assume that then tests

377
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,100
are run after right so you know that it

378
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,720
didn't break anything yeah yeah yeah

379
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,880
okay that's important the test must pass

380
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,399
before and also after yeah yeah okay

381
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,660
cheers yeah

382
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,899

383
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,779
