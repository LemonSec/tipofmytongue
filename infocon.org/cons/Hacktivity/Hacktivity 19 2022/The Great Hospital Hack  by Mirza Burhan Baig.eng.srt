1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,780
presentation uh today it's on screen

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,359
it's a Mirza burhan bag who's here same

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,700
time yesterday the great Hospital hack

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,139
great I cannot join you today personally

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,820
on this stage but I'll try to be there

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,400
next year hopefully so let's start with

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,260
the presentation

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,359
so today my talk will be on the great

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,060
Hospital hack uh we did for a hospital

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,359
industry we do retiming assessment for

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
multiple financial institutions and the

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,800
health industry as well so we came

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,020
across a test and uh that was an

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,500
assessment uh I cannot forget because we

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,780
did a lot a lot in that so I'll be

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,340
covering a lot of point in that today

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,500
and I'll be explaining what where they

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,540
were lacking and what we did so let's

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,820
start with the presentation

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,100
so few words about myself as you're

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,719
already aware that my name is marz

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,280
abrahambik and I'm working as a senior

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,039
security consultant and a UK based firm

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,140
and I'm always CP certified with some of

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,600
the known credentials and I was heavily

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,860
involved in the bug bounty hunting

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,739
program in back 2012 2013 and was

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,540
awarded and honored by Google Microsoft

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,520
Facebook Amazon uh there are a lot of

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,380
companies uh which I cannot put the name

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
over here so I've spoken on the big

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
stages like chriscon

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,299
um black at MIA last year and last

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,580
chapters I've spoken for a lot of Lost

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,119
Chapters in Islam about b-sides and uh

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,580
yeah a lot of things going on uh the Lee

37
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,200
hack this year which happened in the

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,720
Paris so I've worked for the financial

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
institutions I've worked for the health

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,619
industry government industry so I have

41
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,079
quite a large experience that of my and

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,700
nowadays I'm more interested in the red

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,220
teaming and the stock will be covering a

44
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,720
lot of things about my red team

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,939
experience for an organization that we

46
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,400
did earlier as you already will aware

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,560
there's a saying there are only two type

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,540
of companies those who have been hacked

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,079
and those that will be so no matter what

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,119
how many you're putting the boxes

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,220
security boxes in your company or you

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,040
are thinking that you're uh safe but uh

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,740
I must say that nothing has been patched

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,439
successfully or completely so there is a

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,060
loophole there is someone waiting for

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,819
you for you to make mistakes so what

57
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,220
happens uh just take care of your boxes

58
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,780
security boxes and let's see what

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,000
happens next now if I talk about the

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,560
hospital attack surface because I'm

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,480
talking about the hospital redeeming

62
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,580
right now so I'll be covering a lot of

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,700
things that considered to be uh what we

64
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,440
can say a tax service for a hospital in

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,560
hospital industry or the health industry

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,900
if you want to say so there are a large

67
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,360
quantity of diverse endpoints because a

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
lot of vendors are there and you're

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,379
putting all the boxes uh compliance

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,540
requirements tools applications mobile

71
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,400
applications a lot of endpoints are

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,739
there and you need to cover those as

73
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,959
well Insider taxes there are a lot of

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,420
people who have gained the excess and

75
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,360
who have the access it is pretty much

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,940
hard for anyone in the I.T team to

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,400
conclude all the access at one time so

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,379
you have to look for the groups then you

79
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,200
make the subgroups and then we give the

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
permission access and we check the logs

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,220
simultaneously if you have the little

82
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,959
sock system installed in your

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,360
organization and there are spear

84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,800
phishing attacks as well going on for

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,840
the hospital hospitality industry as

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,060
well and the health industry as well if

87
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,420
I'm not wrong because we we are very

88
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,360
much afraid of the uh health issues so

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,519
what happens uh some people are very

90
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,560
well aware about the social engineering

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
but those who are not they're the

92
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,300
what can I say they're the victim for

93
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,560
the social engineering attack for the

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,620
spearfishing yeah uh then High exposure

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,180
of the third party components because as

96
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,280
I mentioned earlier large quantities and

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,860
points uh every vendor comes with their

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,500
own tools set of tools applications data

99
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,440
the apis are exposed there are a lot of

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,060
things going on in the markets so let's

101
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,220
catch up with some facts uh behind the

102
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,860
breaches we will be discussing a few of

103
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,780
them that what happened how this has

104
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,659
happened so it is estimated but it's not

105
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,220
the actual value 42 percent uh was

106
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,099
penetrated by The Outsiders 59 person

107
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,799
were involved inside it because uh most

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,180
of the time most of the time we have

109
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,340
seen that the attack has been initiated

110
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,978
from the inside so it's kind of inside a

111
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,779
job because they have the access to the

112
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,600
uh management area as well they have the

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
access to the uh what we can say the

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
RFID cars the access control list and

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
all the other things so that considered

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,860
to be an Insider threat attacks as well

117
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,199
top patterns that has been observed were

118
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,900
the malicious uh errors in the

119
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,820
application or the web application apis

120
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,340
that kind of thing privilege misuse

121
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,160
basically uh if I'm if I'm privileged to

122
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,500
use the data center or uh to access the

123
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,220
DB so uh I can give the access to

124
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,440
someone because uh of the social

125
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,300
engineering or something else so yeah

126
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,400
web applications web applications are

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,259
heavily involved in the health industry

128
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,919
nowadays as well uh why because most of

129
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,380
us check the reports online rather than

130
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,840
going to the lab or the hospital so we

131
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,060
prefer the mobile application API or the

132
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,220
web application so they are the very

133
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,139
very vulnerable point and points if you

134
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,660
you can see that so the data compromise

135
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,500
was the uh that that's just uh stats and

136
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,840
we are updating that as well uh for the

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,259
next one 72 percent Medical Data 34

138
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,500
person personal data and 25 percent

139
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,320
credentials were exposed and hacked

140
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,280
during the the multiple attacks what can

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,039
you say there are thread actors working

142
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,780
continuously for every industry so few

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,259
of them were Club is astral And Hive

144
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,479
there are a lot of more predictors who

145
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,000
are working against the uh Health

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,759
industry and they are considered as apt

147
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,039
growth because they are working day and

148
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,800
night to just get your health data out

149
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,500
of the system some of the notable data

150
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,120
breaches if I just have to mention over

151
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,800
here Alabama Health System forced to

152
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,139
limit hospitals are after our ransomware

153
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,300
attack yes we have observed that the

154
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,000
health industry uh faces the ransomware

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,759
attack because the medical data and the

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,460
health uh record of the patient is more

157
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,840
critical than anything in the hospital

158
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,900
and if you lose that you might face some

159
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,880
problem in the market and the code as

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,940
well so yeah that's uh pretty much real

161
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,639
world example that was hit by a hospital

162
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,100
hospital was hit by a ransomware and

163
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,960
yeah that happened actually not exactly

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
related to the hospital or the health

165
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
industry but I just want to say and

166
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,319
explain that how apt works there are a

167
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,139
lot of apts working for the different

168
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,819
Industries there is a group Lazarus and

169
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,199
they're working for the financial and

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
the banking industry they are working

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
day and night to get the data out of the

172
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,560
bank and they're making new new

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,539
techniques to procedures and the

174
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,580
processes and there is a Bangladesh

175
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,520
banking attack there uh they took around

176
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,740
uh 81 million US Dollars and uh that was

177
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,500
stopped but there was an attack so there

178
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,479
is a group and they were working on

179
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,699
something so for the financial industry

180
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,759
there are separate apt actors but for

181
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
the health and the hospital industry

182
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,199
there are a lot of different actors

183
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,600
working right now so let's start with

184
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,400
the attack pattern that what we have

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,160
done and what we are going to follow uh

186
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,500
one by one is stream by stream that what

187
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,720
we did how we did that what we have

188
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,120
found that in the attack so I'm going to

189
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,180
just demonstrate you and a tag that we

190
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,000
did for a hospital masking all the data

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because of the confidentiality and I'll

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,699
try to explain you the process that how

193
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,979
you can start the red teaming assessment

194
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,560
for Hospital health industry or any

195
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,660
industry in that case so let's start

196
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,060
with the first thing we did the wi-fi

197
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,120
hacking simple pretty simple uh entry

198
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,819
point in an organization so Wi-Fi attack

199
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,400
we use a Karma attack using evil twin

200
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,280
attack where we launched the uh another

201
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,380
Wi-Fi with the same name and force the

202
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,880
people to disconnect from the original

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,759
one and to connect back to ours that

204
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,160
will bring us two things that can bring

205
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,979
us the hashes as well in the

206
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,720
communication if you are trying to

207
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,479
capture that and

208
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,639
most of the time we can get the clear

209
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,160
part uh clear text password as well so

210
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,900
let's see what happens next so initially

211
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,720
we launched the uh Wi-Fi attack because

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,120
that's pretty much loophole for everyone

213
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,640
in that hospital and there's University

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,219
operated in that as well so there are

215
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,500
students teachers staff admin

216
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,820
Finance people and all the other people

217
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,679
as well they are connecting to the wi-fi

218
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
system of that

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,600
organization and most of them are

220
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,839
vulnerable to our attack and we force

221
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,640
down them to disconnect from the

222
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,380
original one and connecting back it's a

223
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,120
pretty simple attack WiFi attack we used

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,220
to do for the organizations and most of

225
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,899
the people have connected that and we

226
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,600
got the ntlm hashes in that we got the

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
plain text passwords in that and we got

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,180
a lot of thing if I just want to uh tell

229
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,360
you about the data how much data we have

230
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
got through that so we successfully

231
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,000
collected 600 plus credentials either in

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,980
clean tracks on the ntlm no worries we

233
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,160
will try to uh bypass it by tracking the

234
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,839
password and tlm they're most common

235
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,959
things we can use right so

236
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,620
what we did we use the GPU rigs to break

237
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,140
the password internally and because we

238
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,779
cannot offer that ntlm has to some cloud

239
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,779
service or uh someone else because that

240
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,260
is uh uh that what we don't want to do

241
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,380
right so we built the rakes inside the

242
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,800
uh organization office and we try to

243
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,899
crack the password and yeah we

244
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,459
successfully got the password cracked

245
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,600
after the succession of the password

246
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,120
tracking uh we got multiple uh plain

247
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,300
text passwords or through which we start

248
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,700
the investigation by in gathering the

249
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,800
information what kind of user do we have

250
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,339
what students are having what exactly uh

251
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,320
the high privilege users are using

252
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,180
because we have a complete intranet

253
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,160
accounts and all the other things so we

254
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
scratched that one by one and here I

255
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,140
want to bring the point that red aiming

256
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,880
assessment is an assessment that doesn't

257
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,160
count the days because there's an

258
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,600
assessment if you are locking that

259
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,700
assessment for the 5-10 days that won't

260
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
be helping the redeemers to do their job

261
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
it's a ongoing process and we scratch

262
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,220
the back at any time of the day at any

263
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,200
time of the night and we try to get the

264
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,480
data out of the organization so next

265
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,880
step we start the intelligence threat

266
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,399
program and what we did we tried to

267
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,220
collect everything from those users that

268
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,100
we have just uh cracked so first I would

269
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,320
like to tell you that what we have found

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,540
and what's the impact of those things

271
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,760
some of the things that we have found

272
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,640
are the user which privilege accesses so

273
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,700
now uh there's a bell ringing in my mind

274
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,320
that what we were doing that we were

275
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
capturing all the credentials and we are

276
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
trying one by one hard and hard that

277
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
that is there any backup is there any

278
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,779
config file is there any password that

279
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,820
is stored in the plain text is there any

280
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,560
Powershell strip there are a lot of

281
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,779
things going on in my mind desktop host

282
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,940
name and the local administrators uh

283
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,579
because if I can run the command and the

284
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,500
software and the local admin and I can

285
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,839
privilege back to the 80 so I can run

286
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,640
anything inside the organization and

287
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,680
connect back to the outside world let's

288
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,019
see what happens so uh we have found

289
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,779
these soccer ports as well we we have

290
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,760
gained the access to the sock system as

291
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,160
well to see all the reports emails um

292
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,899
Outlook access inside the organization

293
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,000
so we can read every email that is going

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,459
through the sock to the users and and

295
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,079
there are a lot of things going on in

296
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,300
our mind network configuration files to

297
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,940
read the data uh to see what kind of

298
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,279
data they are using creating our own ACL

299
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,959
these are things going on in our mind

300
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,839
that uh if we can get the access on

301
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,300
these one by one we can capture the

302
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,180
whole organization in just a day because

303
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,100
network configuration we can set up the

304
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,740
ACL sock report so we can delete our our

305
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,079
traces back and local admins we can

306
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,019
install anything we want to do yeah

307
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,880
bitlogger Keys there's more instructions

308
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,700
bit logger key is that most interesting

309
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,399
thing that there are a lot of uh drives

310
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,019
that are locked with the BitLocker

311
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,640
because they contain the sunset

312
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,800
information right we put the bit logger

313
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,779
to save all the information but now I

314
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,279
have the key so I can retrieve the

315
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,860
password don't retrieve but I can uh

316
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,740
open up the drive impact was very high

317
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,600
because we can access the emails we can

318
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,880
access the stock reports uh daily

319
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
operations what's going on in the

320
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
organization how they are tracking us

321
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,700
basically the main point was in our mind

322
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
that uh if we can access these sock

323
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
reports or sock system so we can see

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
that how they are planning something

325
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,880
against us in the uh period to attack so

326
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,279
one day before I can see what they're

327
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,720
planning what they're putting the

328
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,339
filters and all the other things so the

329
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,019
next day we can plan a attack

330
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,360
accordingly so there are a lot of things

331
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
going on but right now we don't have

332
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
anything in hand so let's move forward

333
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,260
so next thing uh ad enumeration we name

334
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,600
it uh domain dominance because we are

335
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,320
going for the 80 right now so uh I just

336
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,540
want to own the domain and all the other

337
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,060
things so by scratching some emails and

338
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,339
some reports we found there is an email

339
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,459
uh which was titled administrative right

340
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,820
access form and it contains a list of

341
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,880
users and the email says as you can see

342
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,060
as discussed with Mr blah blah kind of

343
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,420
find the list of the users for

344
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,279
administrative rights now you can see

345
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,860
that we have the list of the users they

346
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,540
have given the access as an

347
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,519
administrator and then the previous

348
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,560
captured attack we have the list of the

349
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,440
users so now we can compare to them and

350
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,000
we can run the we can run as a local

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,639
admin on the system now let's see what

352
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,180
happened next so we created a local user

353
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,959
Mr X as a part of the local admin crop

354
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
now what happens if I can execute the

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
command from there if I can run the

356
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,279
software on the script run the mimikets

357
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,620
and all the other things so now it won't

358
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,620
be stopping me because I am the part of

359
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,260
the local admin group right Microsoft

360
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,480
Defender antivirus exclusion we just

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,300
copier files we copy the mimic it the

362
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,940
most important thing in the attack right

363
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,760
now uh we copy that in a folder and we

364
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
create some exclusions in the antivirus

365
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,579
that please do not scan them do not

366
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,220
delete them or just exclude them while

367
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,260
you're scanning anything so in that was

368
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,380
nitty and the organization part the

369
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,240
antivirus is not scanning our mimikets

370
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,100
the most dangerous thing that could

371
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,440
happen to an organization after that we

372
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,420
run the power sploit that enumerated

373
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,180
domain admin groups Enterprise admin

374
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,399
groups a lot of thing going on in that

375
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,199
organization that we have captured we

376
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,339
are we we were a short of uh data saving

377
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,920
devices hard drives external hard drives

378
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,959
because there are lot of data coming in

379
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,199
with the documents not just the tags

380
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,519
with the documents and all the other

381
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,399
collections of the PDF Blueprints and

382
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,079
what's on what not because we are just

383
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,240
collecting the data after that we can

384
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,699
filter that out and we will see what we

385
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,220
have to do but right now the main goal

386
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,079
is to capture everything that we are

387
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,360
getting from that organization

388
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,620
so after the hard work of ours we were

389
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,500
able to find an active directory backup

390
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,579
so I was not sure how old it is what

391
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,399
does it contains but backup is a backup

392
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,639
you you can find anything and maybe

393
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,459
maybe I can use it for some purpose so

394
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,880
let's see what happens we found the uh

395
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,880
basically it shows the location of the

396
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,760
backup we navigated to that location and

397
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,880
we found a lot of thing going on in that

398
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,459
system so what we try to do we try to

399
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,000
just copy and uh see what the files

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,899
contains so now we tried the ntds.dit

401
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,420
file we try to extract the content of

402
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,199
that file to see what happens in this so

403
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,380
uh ntds.dit file that contains a

404
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,959
database for the active directory it

405
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,720
contains the password hashes uh maybe it

406
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,240
can contain thousands of caches right

407
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,820
now so let's see there is a system file

408
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,800
as well the boot key and all the other

409
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,259
things for that purpose so what we did

410
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,199
we just extracted that and we try to

411
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,060
open and extract the content of that

412
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,060
file and boom what we found we are just

413
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,079
decrypting the file and there were 28

414
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,440
000 Plus hashes in that file that was a

415
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,420
boom movement for us because we can and

416
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,459
track the hashes we can see what's going

417
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,439
on in the organization that can contain

418
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
the sog management Finance admin

419
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,919
directors there are a lot of things

420
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,260
going on in our mind so we move forward

421
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,780
with that and we try to crack the

422
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,480
passwords as much as we can do so we

423
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,459
have tracked the password there were

424
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,919
these service credentials there were

425
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
privileged accounts weak password hashes

426
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,900
user mailbox jump servers there are a

427
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,540
lot of thing going on so what we try to

428
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,760
do we try to crack the passwords and

429
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,120
write uh reuse that to see what's going

430
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
on and after a few moments of the hard

431
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
work we were able to capture the most

432
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,539
important thing in the network that is a

433
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,700
Golden Ticket those who know what is a

434
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,200
gold indicate that's perfectly fine but

435
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,580
those who don't know about the golden

436
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,160
ticket the golden ticket file is

437
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,000
something uh that makes you unrestricted

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,179
and there's access to every system every

439
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,700
domain every user in the network so you

440
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,580
can annexes everything in the network

441
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,640
but there's a backup of the ad but we

442
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,919
are not sure if it's gonna work or not

443
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,120
so we tried that and hopefully yes we

444
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,919
did that and that work in the network

445
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,980
and what we did next We Run The mimikets

446
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,039
yeah because we were the local admin as

447
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,140
well we have the credential for that and

448
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,200
we made the anti-virus exclusion as well

449
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,900
in the directory so now we can run the

450
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,020
mimikits purely plainly as we are

451
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,179
planned so we try to Traverse the

452
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,400
directories it denies We Run The mimikes

453
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
and then what happens we try to access

454
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,100
that directory by escalating the

455
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,039
Privileges yes so we were able to

456
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,380
Traverse the directories we were able to

457
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,120
see the reports and all the other things

458
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,760
now the main thing that is more

459
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,220
interested for me to capture all the

460
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,200
health record data record because that's

461
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,419
the critical thing and the sock reports

462
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,799
that's a critical thing for an

463
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,080
organization to display that you are

464
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,640
vulnerable and your data can be leaked

465
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,980
out so now moving to the third phase of

466
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,780
the attack which is a network compromise

467
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,820
we have captured the credentials we have

468
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,280
dominated the 80 and we have got the

469
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,500
golden ticket now we are moving towards

470
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,480
the network compromise we will see the

471
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,580
firewalls we will see the vpns we will

472
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,440
see the scan reports let's see what we

473
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,419
can find okay some of the artifacts that

474
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,039
we have discovered during this phase

475
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,799
were the vulnerability assessment scan

476
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,900
report so we were very well aware what

477
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,340
kind of vulnerabilities are going on in

478
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,160
this network or the machines and where

479
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,720
this is specifically particularly

480
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,340
vulnerable right now device

481
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,200
configuration files the firewall

482
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,539
configuration files we can access that

483
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,880
very easily we can see the ACLS and all

484
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,460
the other things SSL VPN user with their

485
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,679
access level this is the most critical

486
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,200
thing because I can if I want to uh

487
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,919
transfer data inside or outside I'm just

488
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,020
looking for the VPN and the SSL access

489
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,660
level user so I can connect from the

490
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,520
external to the internal and drivers

491
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,919
back back to the data that I want to

492
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,220
send Network inventory almost everything

493
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,400
was captured and we were just hitting it

494
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,980
one by one in the face so we can capture

495
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,799
all the data so accessing the firewall

496
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,600
was the first thing we connect to that

497
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,960
and we try to capture the firewall and

498
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,059
now let's see what happens we log into

499
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,880
the 40 gate account and we are trying to

500
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
firewall back during the firewall how we

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,700
created a user that is a super admin

502
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,880
with a some particular pretty same name

503
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,059
as the previous one so no one will

504
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,580
suspect that this is newly created if

505
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,039
the lock says that says but and then

506
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,780
with the Naked Eyes no one can consider

507
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,820
that this is a malicious backdoor right

508
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,160
so we created that and we try to log in

509
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,919
with that specific user firewall was

510
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,980
back door now what we create try to

511
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,820
create we we we log into the system we

512
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,179
try to the uh login of the ad admin

513
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,280
rights and we see how we can manipulate

514
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,500
the ACLS and there were a lot of things

515
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,760
that we have tried which is not

516
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,340
mentioned over here uh but I'll try to

517
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,500
just give you a brief overview that what

518
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,960
we did simply we just back door the

519
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,480
firewall by creating a user these all

520
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,580
techniques and the procedures are pretty

521
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,880
simple if you find a loophole right the

522
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,220
main purpose of this assessment was to

523
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,919
get into that organization and if you

524
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,320
are inside the organization for once and

525
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,940
you can play your tactics your

526
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,620
procedures and all the other things

527
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,299
they're pretty simple thing right

528
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,299
trading a admin account on the firewall

529
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,520
that's a pretty simple but to get access

530
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,140
to that point is the main thing so yeah

531
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,559
we we created the user with the read and

532
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,140
write access everything was organized

533
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,740
everything was planned and we uh allowed

534
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,419
the access to the telnet as well if you

535
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,400
want to take the telnet of that machine

536
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,280
or the firewall to change the rules ACL

537
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,679
so yeah we did that and in the meantime

538
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,360
we were creating that we were scratching

539
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,520
the emails as well uh another team was

540
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,500
doing that they were scratching the

541
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,539
emails and they noticed that there were

542
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,120
some emails that the support IDs were

543
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,799
created there are support agents support

544
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,780
people and they were creating the IDS

545
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,659
for them so there was an email which

546
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,880
says that few users are removed and some

547
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,559
of them have given the privilege right

548
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,260
what we can do we have the users we have

549
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,840
the passwords we tried one of them and

550
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,539
yeah we can login into the uh firewall

551
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,080
once again and now we are accessing it

552
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,200
with the support IDs previously captured

553
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,539
now we don't have to use our own

554
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,880
credential that we have created uh back

555
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,159
door but we have used use the similar

556
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,820
one that we found over the email now the

557
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,580
main thing that I was looking for

558
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,159
previously is a sock report and the sock

559
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,500
monitoring how they're working and what

560
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,799
they are chatting about so we found a

561
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,159
ticket that states that there were some

562
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,620
users were created and we were not aware

563
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,020
of they were accessing something we are

564
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,740
not aware of and a user was created on

565
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,080
our device and were not informed about

566
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,419
there are a lot of complaints from them

567
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,220
that there a lot of user has been

568
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,940
created given the X's but the sock team

569
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
was not aware of anything that has

570
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,880
happened so there are a lot of things in

571
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,860
our hand now we have the sock reports we

572
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,900
have the VA reports Network identities

573
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,600
now what we are going to do we are

574
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,700
creating the malicious support IDs on

575
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,919
the active directory now we have created

576
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,900
the back door on the firewall we are

577
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,659
just keeping our hand tied over the

578
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,539
network for that we create the people

579
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,559
support IDs on the ad so it looks legit

580
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,740
for anyone that looks inside the 80 or

581
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,200
the network or if someone is accessing

582
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,640
something on the network with the

583
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,740
support ID so they will consider yeah

584
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,140
that's a support ID that's not a

585
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,140
malicious thing to do so we just created

586
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,179
the support IDs and after the creation

587
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,340
of the support IDs we try to log in

588
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,280
again to test that if that works or not

589
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,600
and yes it worked like a charm we were

590
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,460
logging into the firewall with the

591
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,340
support ID that is created just recently

592
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,980
so you are following the trail how we

593
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,860
entered and how we are Marching towards

594
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,900
our goal so that's the perspective of

595
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,600
the red teaming assistant that start

596
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,880
from somewhere do whatever you want to

597
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,760
do and just get the access to the main

598
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,520
core system so now we are confirmed that

599
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,220
uh we are sure that the access control

600
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,220
or the support IDs are working perfectly

601
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,260
same goes with the email boxes we

602
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,539
created the user ID we try to access the

603
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,140
emails and we have seen a lot of emails

604
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,799
going on in the organization alert stock

605
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,840
reports because every time we do

606
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,780
something they send the alert uh user

607
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,120
account was deleted user account was

608
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,700
created we removed those emails by the

609
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,620
way while we are doing the test we

610
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,960
remove those emails so no one get the

611
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,720
suspicious of that what's going on we

612
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,120
check the email there's alert new user

613
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,400
created we delete that so no one has

614
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,440
seen that email that someone has created

615
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,360
something on the network so that's a

616
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,820
planned activity that we were doing for

617
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,860
that organization

618
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,900
so ladies and gentlemen we are moving

619
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,700
towards the final phase of the attack

620
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,340
now we are trying to access the data

621
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,100
center and the backups uh of the

622
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,620
complete Organization for that we try to

623
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,200
back door the HP Superdome as well uh

624
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,000
the credentials were not cracked they

625
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,700
were found in the plain tags in a file

626
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,520
we scratched uh previously so we log in

627
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,860
and just the way we backdoor the network

628
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,240
device we backdoor the HP Super Dome and

629
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,840
to add up the spices we take the

630
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,760
connection from the VPN from the

631
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,620
external to the internal and we allow

632
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,260
the access on the firewall ACL that we

633
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,140
can access that anytime any day uh we

634
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,179
want and we can take the data from that

635
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,100
as well because we have everything we

636
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,980
have a backups and we have the admin

637
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,380
users with the ACL controls and

638
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,840
perfectly fine now what we did we tried

639
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,600
to take the access to a host that is

640
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,419
responsible for the health database and

641
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,140
it contains the Oracle uh backup service

642
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,140
and we saw that thing and we tried to

643
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,799
take the next step and we try to check

644
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,500
the backups if we can get those backup

645
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,179
out of the system

646
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,159
this is the moment that I was waiting

647
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,100
because I was just waiting for the

648
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,440
records I was not interested in the

649
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,539
firewall I was not interested in the VPN

650
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,460
but I'm interested in the records

651
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,400
because this is the most critical thing

652
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,919
for an organization they're trying to

653
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,779
save that they're trying to put the

654
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,840
boxes in front of that thousand of boxes

655
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,120
people working day and night to secure

656
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,179
that but achieving going there getting

657
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,120
the files is the most satisfying thing

658
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,299
in the whole attack so now we have the

659
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,760
files we have the host we have the

660
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,919
backup and yeah

661
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,679
that was a white uh red teaming but

662
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,360
white ball so we have to inform

663
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,880
everything and we inform everything

664
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,900
securely according to the NDA and we try

665
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,900
to make it happen as soon as possible

666
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,120
rather than someone getting hands on

667
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,820
that we try to report it back and fix

668
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,340
that next morning and after that we

669
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,720
create the report and all the other

670
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
things to the management but the main

671
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,059
goal is to make sure it is secured on

672
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,980
the same day because it's very very

673
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,840
extremely critical thing that we have

674
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,380
just found so ladies and gentlemen look

675
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,020
for everything uh there's a code that I

676
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,020
always use you can patch every system in

677
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,600
this world but you cannot patch humanist

678
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,559
stupidity because why I say that the

679
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,740
social engineering is the main part of

680
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,960
the red teaming attack either we do with

681
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,940
the Wi-Fi either we do with the

682
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,580
cafeteria either I try to clone your

683
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,559
card by the way we try to clone the card

684
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,419
as well in this attack which I have not

685
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,679
mentioned over here because something

686
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,860
are confidential so we try to clone the

687
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,080
card of the user from the data center

688
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,020
and we try to access that as well

689
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,419
getting our close change and making

690
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,600
ourselves someone else from industry and

691
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,580
yeah we did that as well in this

692
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,919
assessment so ladies and gentlemen just

693
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,320
look out for everything anything in your

694
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,900
organization and red teaming is an

695
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,000
assessment uh that everyone every

696
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,279
organization should consider should do

697
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,640
so no one takes their data out of the

698
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,220
organization without their permission so

699
