1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,319
so now I will hand you over to Ignacio

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,798
okay I think

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,720
okay

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,059
everyone can hear me oh yeah Okay cool

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,400
so here we go

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,299
uh my name is

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,340
so be patient because I have to I my

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,020
first language are Spanish and I have to

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,960
sing in Spanish and translate them

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,119
um I now I work in like a software

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
engineer in attack IQ

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,320
uh and there's my social media if you

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,759
have any question or something before

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,140
you talk

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,500
a little bit what will you see today uh

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
first of all it's like a kind of

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,760
introduction uh how I found these bugs

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
and issues

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,780
and then a little recently about the the

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,000
NFC box application marks and web

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
applications

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,200
and forever for the end of the talk I

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,140
will show you like a comparison or how

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,500
we can match this one with our top 10.

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,840
this is not a series I talk or something

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,359
like that the the title is designed for

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,060
people without yes I take knowledge or

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,939
people who is starting in this one can

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,700
you understand so

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,360
a little disclaimer some procedures and

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,700
techniques using here are not completely

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,340
legal and maybe some companies

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,460
organization can take legal action so

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,100
don't do it or if you do it take care

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,340
with that but try to don't do it

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,920
so how would you started uh when I was

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,020
hanging out with friends and we are

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,820
moving to another bar

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,159
um in the window of the car I found that

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,159
pamphlet and that says something like a

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,259
now with Mauricio parking you can park

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,200
with your phone directly

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,860
um

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,880
a night

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,379
and that was one just for car or if you

46
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,879
have two cars you need two or if you

47
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
charge your car you need another one

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
and when the application was released

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,819
now the people can do everything with

50
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,920
the with their phone like uh park the

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,640
car change money to the parking uh a

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
different car and that and they can see

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,260
the transaction history about the

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,640
parkings and that

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,599
so the now you have two options you can

56
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,400
use the keychain or you can use

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,019
application

58
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,900
and I found the problems like in March

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,060
or April of 2022

60
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,879
uh well there is a pamphlet and there is

61
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,040
the the login page of the application

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,040
and there is a little new when the

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
application was released

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,540
so

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,700
first of all I try to do a little

66
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,519
Wireless attack dictionary attack to the

67
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,159
login page with the knowledge with the

68
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,080
no dictionaries and not the people who

69
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,099
use

70
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,560
and what didn't work and also I tried to

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,360
SQL injection

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,200
but no no no not to get taxes

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,580
bless you

74
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,920
and then uh and then I try a directory

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,819
list

76
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,540
and I found some interesting urls

77
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,239
and one of them is this one slash

78
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,080
download

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,540
and there is a kind of a readme or

80
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,760
installation guide about the the energy

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,060
reader the NFC use in for the keychain

82
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,459
um I in the vote another page you have a

83
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,099
kind of dedication they say something

84
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,860
like uh here you have all the files this

85
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,900
is for you Lucy I don't have to release

86
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,299
it but thank you

87
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,640
um I don't love that file and I extract

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,400
them and I found some interesting stuff

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,239
uh one of them is like a log fight

90
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,640
and I found this

91
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,560
request

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,380
with the ID session and I say okay maybe

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,399
we can found some SQL in checking here

94
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,060
but we didn't have the the server URL or

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,100
the IEP address or something

96
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
so now we have two different sites for

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,020
continue the research

98
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,419
one of them is moving to the application

99
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,520
and website and I think it's the most

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,220
pretty I prefer it JavaScript or Java

101
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,979
instead of C but

102
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,780
we will continue with you with the

103
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,139
controller so what we had in all the in

104
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,360
all that files

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,600
uh we have the entire controller for the

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,740
for the NFC tag for the MiFi reader so

107
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,380
we can install them in our computer if

108
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,060
we have the reader

109
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,979
uh we can install them and we can do

110
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,040
whatever we want like a clone the tags

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,500
uh read the content of the cars of the

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,699
attacks

113
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,979
or just format them

114
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,340
uh and also obviously for do this one we

115
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,800
need a key the key used for for the

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,979
keychain but we have the guitar code in

117
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,500
the in the controller so

118
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,840
we can do whatever we want if we have

119
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,919
the

120
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,479
the properly

121
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,860
so

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,740
moving to the application and website

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,680
uh I download the Android application I

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,419
the compiler

125
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,020
and first of all I get noticed about the

126
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,419
all the code of the application was in

127
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,220
plain text so they didn't have

128
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,199
encryption or off location or something

129
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,600
so you can read all the code of the

130
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,860
application

131
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,240
and then 40 minutes

132
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,740
and then I found for a lot of common

133
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,380
strings with the IP address and the URL

134
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,360
server for the production for testing

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,560
and development

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,740
and all of them was common and well I

137
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,000
found the the URL and I try to do a kind

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,740
of SQL injector

139
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,620
and that will work so

140
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,259
now we have a one second instruction in

141
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,340
the code

142
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,520
and if we exploit them we found 92

143
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
tables all of them in plain texture and

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,380
the most interesting tables is the users

145
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,080
tables in the users tables we have the

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,900
users and the password but just in case

147
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,120
this didn't work also we have the ID

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,460
session and we can replace the cookie in

149
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,259
our Navigator and this will reward too

150
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,180
and now we have the user password and

151
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,759
the admin password so we can try to log

152
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,020
it in and we get login so

153
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,720
now we are the owners of the system we

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,580
can play with them or

155
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,160
report them

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,600
um

157
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,759
what we can do with the system

158
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
about the park

159
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,900
about the parking matters we have the IP

160
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,300
address so we can play directly with the

161
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,580
parking meter

162
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,560
uh we can and also we can turn around to

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
turn off them delete them we can do

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,819
whatever we want

165
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,280
uh about the we have the location for of

166
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,419
them

167
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,840
and allow the users we can create new

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
users delete new user or administrator

169
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,440
to

170
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
and also we can see all the transaction

171
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,819
history for the charge the money for the

172
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,000
devs for we can we can see everything

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,900
and moving a little bit about the users

174
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,960
the do we have 70k user more or less in

175
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Rio Gordo

176
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,580
and we have the personal data and the

177
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,280
parking data about the personal data we

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,039
have the the normal stuff like a ID

179
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,160
number phone number the address we have

180
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,380
everything over there and about the

181
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,979
parking data we have the

182
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,560
okay for example we can say okay this

183
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,560
guy Park every day at the same time for

184
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,599
the same hours in the same place maybe

185
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,020
this guy work here or something and also

186
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,759
we have the home address and we can

187
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,500
check that is different we can be doing

188
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,580
that

189
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,220
so I think that is a risk information if

190
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,160
someone with bad intention get them and

191
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
I think it's like a kind of big deal

192
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
and after that I continue and research a

193
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
little bit more about it

194
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
and I found the same system was

195
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,620
implemented in five different cities in

196
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,799
Argentina like a medium or big city

197
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,279
so I never was good with math but I do

198
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,159
some calculation about it and almost the

199
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,099
44 about the population of Rio cuarto

200
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,519
used them so if we have five cities and

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,860
about the population of each one

202
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,000
we now don't didn't have a 70 000 users

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
we have a 345

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,640
000 users all of them with the data and

205
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,899
that

206
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,940
so

207
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,600
foreign

208
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,060
application security

209
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,620
is used for developers or security

210
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,360
professional for much the different

211
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,339
vulnerabilities

212
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,740
uh for example the number one the broken

213
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,440
Access Control where we can found that

214
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
we can found them in the in the web page

215
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,120
in the first one where we can form the

216
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,620
all this all the

217
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,720
all the code about the

218
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,580
the NFC Reader

219
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,380
and about the second one the

220
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,420
cryptographic failures we confirm them

221
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,100
in the application and also we can found

222
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,600
them in the Android

223
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,380
uh well in check them

224
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,360
we get the credentials on that and

225
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,700
insecure design for example we can form

226
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,560
them in about two

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,140
uh uh if you never hear about the hours

228
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,720
of your starting in this world so I

229
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,399
recommend to you there is a accurate

230
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,860
code on that and you have a six more for

231
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,720
for checking that

232
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,779
and for finish this one a little update

233
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,320
all of this one was was reported and the

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
company gave me the thanks and that

235
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,060
they fixed at the model of PHP so there

236
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,660
is no more SQL instruction

237
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,399
and but when I was writing this present

238
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,580
this slice they still have some SQL

239
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,600
instructions so everything is normal too

240
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,000
and also the password have not have no

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
big challenges so I try to log it in

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,519
again with the same credentials and this

243
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,339
work so

244
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,260
some good practices and that they never

245
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,380
was a play but well I do myself so I

246
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,880
report them if they didn't change the

247
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,579
password it's not my deal so

248
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,100
and I think that is everything if you

249
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,440
come you have time yeah yeah so if you

250
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,839
have any question or something or that

251
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,800
is it

252
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,459
thank you

253
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:04,680
