1
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,719
activity asks you to drink responsibly

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,340
whatever that means

3
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,340
looks like we're nearly there it's all

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,800
about the I.T

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,619
yeah it is my fault to be honest all

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,900
right so over to mark

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,680
sorry for the being delayed uh

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,780
technology is not something that we

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,379
could be proud of I believe so let's

10
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,399
have a little talk about numbers

11
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,000
in the past years developers became so

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,379
freaking

13
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,700
I would say spoiled uh by the justworks

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,000
mentality that we really had to give

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,820
them kind of a squeeze I would say and

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,379
therefore I prepared this talk uh as no

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,720
one is actually able to escape the

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,420
introduction I would not Escape it

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,360
either my name is Mark moodley and I've

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,299
been creating breaking and fixing

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,780
systems around the world in the past oh

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,799
gosh

23
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,580
20 25 years I'm always as hell so yeah

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,360
in the past 25 years and I've gathered

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,119
some interesting stories during these

26
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,720
days and therefore I would like to share

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
one of the stories with you at least

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,060
so uh

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,360
I've been traveling in Europe quite a

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,780
lot is there anybody from this country

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,820
or is there anybody who could name which

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,600
country this is

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,700
it's Switzerland I kind of like this

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,000
place because it has a lot of nice lakes

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
and the trains are always on time

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,459
actually I was there during our

37
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,840
honeymoon and I had The Misfortune to

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
experience the only train in Switzerland

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,900
that was late in like the past 100 years

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,900
or something like that so on the train

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,940
station

42
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,239
we've seen an interesting thing a link

43
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,120
to a document

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,220
which

45
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,720
I wouldn't say that I was bored on my

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,140
honeymoon but I started to read is there

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,879
anyone who could speak German in the

48
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,160
audience raise your hand

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,640
okay uh I would not bore everyone to try

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,780
to decode uh what's over here but I

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,019
really love uh to understand the

52
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,200
following translation that I made feel

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,239
free to judge it so if you've got a

54
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,200
better translation just reach me out at

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,120
uh

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,599
mark.modly at hardcoreit.com so

57
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,420
why is this topic quite interesting to

58
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,099
us in the train building

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,280
what is this magic number that we've

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,239
highlighted over here

61
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,580
one bit

62
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,319
es Maybe

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,000
go ahead so uh this is exactly one byte

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,360
so if a train company or a railway

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,599
system could

66
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,239
basically tell the word that you know

67
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,400
what we are not going to put in the time

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
and effort to create a software where

69
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,519
you are able to to get around in train

70
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,060
the size that you want then I would say

71
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,879
we could look further into numbers and

72
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
take it serious

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,019
so if we take uh the number the 256 into

74
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,040
account then the legislation only

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,220
mentioned this number so if I want to

76
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,060
break around in Switzerland I will be

77
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,220
able to drive a train with the real

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,880
number of

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,740
button

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,900
that is forbidden I have to check it

81
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,840
what's the next number which would

82
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,820
be problematic in this area

83
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,180
all right

84
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,580
yes exactly I do not know I'm just

85
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,540
throwing in your general direction so uh

86
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,020
the 250

87
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,160
256 number is a problem it is it gets

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,040
displayed in the actual file that states

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,740
that well you are not allowed to do that

90
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,100
of course uh every trained conductor has

91
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,759
to check that uh you are not uh having

92
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,259
exactly 256 wheels or axles sorry on

93
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,080
your train but as good hackers we would

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,580
we would drive around in uh 512 extra

95
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,919
long of trains if you do not really

96
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,160
believe me that this is an actual

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,940
legislation in uh Switzerland just

98
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,060
follow the link by the way does it work

99
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,080
could you tell me

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
who's the first one who checked

101
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,000
so this is the actual link uh to the

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,880
document and now that I destroyed all my

103
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,840
credibility uh I could get forward and

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,620
tell you a little fake uh story uh that

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,500
is an old dad joke so uh

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,460
I didn't believe that one of my friend

107
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,240
who was working as a road construction

108
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,960
uh has been stealing from his workplace

109
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,199
Works place but when I arrived to their

110
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,340
home all the signs were there now so in

111
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,699
numerics also the signs are there and we

112
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,620
could have problems here as well not

113
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,380
just the uh horrible jokes that I'm

114
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,240
gonna tell for you so you are free to

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,340
live by the way no one is tying you down

116
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,780
there okay uh

117
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,199
developers tend to get comfortable and

118
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,660
spoiled and

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,319
uh tend to believe

120
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,580
that normal arithmetic operates in our

121
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,240
world as it does in computers

122
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,240
so is there anybody for a duck who could

123
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,180
tell me what the following statement

124
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,940
will print come on it's just like four

125
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,639
lines of C or C plus plus code

126
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,880
is there anybody who could tell me

127
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,580
it is not that big of a thing just

128
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,979
adding minus one zero and one together

129
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,620
quack quack the time is up

130
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,580
what would it be

131
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,060
pattern

132
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,440
we are going to arrive to that

133
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,520
but actually this is more than 4 billion

134
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,620
you are failing at basic mathematics

135
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,099
right now if you're gonna check this and

136
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,139
let me let me check if I could restart

137
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,360
my terminal for example because my

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,740
computer just crashed before

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
we arrived on the stage

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,940
and let me show you that this is not

141
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,900
just a fluke

142
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,240
so are here

143
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,259
let me

144
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,900
check it we've got a file called

145
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,460
example.c I believe

146
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,779
yes this is exactly the same four lines

147
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,659
of C code that we had

148
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,620
now if I compile uh this uh this uh

149
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,580
little application

150
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
and run this little snippet

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,540
that should be the only one who runs we

152
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,240
can see indeed that this is the 4

153
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
billion that we've seen on the slides

154
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
that is kind of strange what is

155
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,959
happening

156
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,100
in here so as you can see uh we are

157
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,980
using different types of numbers here

158
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,860
for example the minus one is a signed

159
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,880
integer the uh 0 U is an unsigned

160
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,120
integer and the one long is assigned

161
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,339
long value and therefore if you are

162
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,060
writing any C or C plus plus application

163
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,820
if you juggle around with the types you

164
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,580
could have these kind of errors and

165
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,240
these kind of problems so I would kindly

166
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,959
ask everyone if you write anything in C

167
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,660
or C plus plus try to use the same

168
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,779
number types or at least check it the

169
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,660
behavior is because the upcasting of

170
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,320
numbers if you take a look at the 0 U

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,959
that is messing up everything because we

172
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,820
are storing numbers in a two complements

173
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,459
format etc etc kind of an interesting

174
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,160
task if you would like to I will bore

175
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,620
you with the details after the talk but

176
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,580
let's go uh to the next uh point is

177
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,720
there any question by the way to this

178
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,839
not yet or I was able to steamroll

179
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,700
everyone so what does uh bubble do in an

180
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,560
empty room

181
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,959
of course it

182
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,600
flows let's see floats

183
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,360
uh if you are failing the basic

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
arithmetics for example adding together

185
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,899
1 and -1 uh now uh you could get ready

186
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,660
to fail in advanced mathematics as well

187
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,440
have you ever divided by zero

188
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,620
thank you

189
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,140
yes on the mechanical computer that

190
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,600
would cause quite a havoc and if you are

191
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,640
doing integer operation that would

192
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,880
result in an exception as well but

193
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,339
let me just check if I'm able to get

194
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,740
back to the example

195
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,120
dot slash should be example Java

196
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
yes

197
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,000
that should be example the Java I

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
believe we've got the same that's five

199
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
lines so uh

200
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,180
what is that like 25 increment to the C

201
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,240
code to get around uh

202
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,480
we've got this little Java snippet and

203
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,459
of course uh we have the same problem

204
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,600
here

205
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,459
that the expected value or or the

206
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,160
expected exception is not happening at

207
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,320
all that is quite a problem I would

208
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,019
believe and in

209
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,860
every languages that are uh using the

210
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,560
floating Point algorithm or the floating

211
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
point

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,440
uh standard then they are behaving the

213
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,100
same so as you can see we've got the

214
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Infinity uh in floating point there are

215
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,560
other quite interesting stories as well

216
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,920
uh if you've ever developed a game or

217
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,760
try to break one they mostly use uh

218
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,860
floating Point numbers like doubles and

219
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,660
stuff

220
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,839
but they never do equation comparison

221
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,320
comparison so as you know we've got a

222
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,540
language which is quite used in the uh

223
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,500
web word and in the web word uh if you

224
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,519
use JavaScript to add together

225
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,160
0.1 and 0.2 what will be the result

226
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,459
for another duck

227
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,420
not

228
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,959
0.3 but 0.3

229
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
0004

230
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,040
this is because uh the floating Point

231
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,519
algorithm is just an approximation

232
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,100
meaning that you do not really have

233
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,600
exact

234
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,740
values in this case so uh let me

235
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,680
have a developer console for you and run

236
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,760
some stuff

237
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,440
maybe we will see over here

238
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,700
so

239
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,620
uh who could tell me what the result of

240
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,399
this uh spoiled something is what I've

241
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,040
stated let me check it because I lost my

242
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,719
credibility with the recalling

243
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,339
so as you can see indeed it is not 0.3

244
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,339
even though you add two seemingly

245
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,620
innocent number together then you get

246
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,260
something which is kind of strange but

247
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,000
we can go further in this environment or

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,579
word

249
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,360
0.3

250
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,180
is not 0.3 at all

251
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,860
so if you take a look at the 0.3 and we

252
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,700
print it to a greater

253
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,279
Precision like

254
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,839
54

255
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,920
then we can see that indeed 0.3 is

256
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,399
smaller than 0.3

257
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,579
and we have another interesting thing

258
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,060
all right all right everything uh with

259
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,660
the decimal point in in it could be

260
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,500
wrecked but there is more even numbers

261
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,380
which do not have had decimal points is

262
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,740
there anybody who could tell me what the

263
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,139
second example

264
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,760
uh would result in

265
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,899
for another doctor of course

266
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,800
could you expand that a little bit

267
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,079
we are getting to the right point so you

268
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,300
definitely deserve a duck what is

269
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,279
happening here in JavaScript this number

270
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,079
does not exist

271
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,920
at all

272
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,019
you're gonna attack them

273
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,600
okay uh I would not try to attempt to

274
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,420
destroy the uh

275
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,120
well that's perfect again thank you so

276
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,660
this number does not exist in JavaScript

277
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,060
if I try to get this number by adding

278
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,579
the

279
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,720
so this number exists right but if we

280
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,399
want to add one to it

281
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
it simply does not exist it Returns the

282
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
same number and we are able to create

283
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,220
scenarios in node environments for

284
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,279
example when we DDOS the whole system

285
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,560
with just one number which is never

286
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,420
incremented even though we are

287
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,600
incrementing it uh all the time

288
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,139
so

289
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,779
let me get back to the slides uh how is

290
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,519
this even possible

291
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,320
it was so bad or either nobody got it so

292
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,040
let's summarize everything uh

293
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,440
what the hell does this everything do

294
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,560
with hacking and uh with I.T security at

295
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,880
all so in the first case uh with the

296
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,240
examples of trains uh we know that it is

297
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,299
not just I.T security that we are

298
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,059
jeopardizing uh by using or creating

299
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,720
systems that use numbers that are so low

300
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,140
and small uh that we could override with

301
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,660
our train uh with 512 axles on the

302
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,380
tracks but we could have quite a lot of

303
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,559
other problems as well uh we could DDOS

304
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,500
for example systems uh with the above

305
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,840
mentioned example although it is a whole

306
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,679
number and also if someone is Old As I

307
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,580
Am they should remember the mark of the

308
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,820
beast error or bug their floating Point

309
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,020
algorithm weren't able to decide in a

310
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,240
really small number which one to choose

311
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,539
and they basically they were able to

312
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,660
DDOS everything uh we're just sending

313
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,000
one number and the pausing of that

314
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
number broke the whole system down also

315
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,419
integer overflows as the first example

316
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,580
under the floating Point problems could

317
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,340
arise uh

318
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,679
is there anybody who could

319
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,960
tell me what the following sequence is

320
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,120
or the result

321
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,700
of that

322
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,039
and we are arriving to the

323
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,020
not the number

324
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,620
guy

325
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,820
Batman I wanted to get a a Batman faced

326
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,520
duck but it was out of stock so sorry I

327
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,740
would have been better all right so

328
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,760
let's summarize everything uh

329
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,059
if we take a look at numbers and we

330
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,820
start to get comfortable with them a lot

331
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,480
of times we really do not know what we

332
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
are doing as developers and therefore if

333
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
you would like to break a system it is

334
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,419
always nice to try what the developer do

335
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,480
does not know so thank you very much for

336
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,059
listening uh questions and feedback is

340
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,500
to protect them from you

341
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,620
so far it is uh successful but if

342
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,299
someone is not attending a course like

343
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,880
this then they have no idea what is

344
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
going on in this world

345
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,280
okay is there any question that I should

346
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
answer with numbers

347
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,980

uh I need to tell you that while writing

352
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,120
this presentation I got into the fight

353
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,200
uh with minus one and one uh so I could

354
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,039
say that the odds were against me

355
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,039
yeah

356
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,980
