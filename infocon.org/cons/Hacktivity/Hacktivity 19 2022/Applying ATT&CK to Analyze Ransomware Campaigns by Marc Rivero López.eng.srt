22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,239
everything

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,180
um so my name is Mark I'm working at

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,879
Kaspersky and the Global Research and

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,000
Analysis team also known as great and my

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,240
talk will be about how to apply or why

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,460
it's important to apply uh mitral attack

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,420
to analyze one of the major and like

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,760
funny topics nowadays that is Ram

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,420
somewhere because it affects everybody

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,340
so the idea is still go through the

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,580
presentation to see

33
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,659
an entire campaign analysis using Mitra

34
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,240
and then one cool report that we release

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,180
it for everybody Justin encouraged you

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,060
to read it because you will learn a lot

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,060
about how these sorry cyber criminal

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,740
groups are attacking everybody

39
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,040
so I don't know if you are a reader of

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,520
um the record uh is one of the my

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,000
sources to get like news in the about

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,460
news in the industry and there is an

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,200
interesting publication that they made

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,340
in February regarding how much uh money

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,939
um

46
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,700
um were paid to criminals in 2000 in

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,239
2021 and it's like a huge amount of

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,720
money to be honest and meaning that um

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,540
we always know about the payments that

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,660
were done meaning that when a big team

51
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,020
is affected and ransomware is acting as

52
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,540
ransomware as a service group the name

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,560
and the and the description and probably

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,260
the files in the beginning doesn't pay

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,080
it's uploading on those uh ransomware

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,020
block size and then everybody it's aware

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,620
about the attack that they suffered but

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,840
we are missing an important piece here

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,540
about all the attacks that companies are

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,280
suffering but all the contracts for

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
example are made through email or Java

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,640
or other platforms and are not published

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,819
everywhere so we are like missing part

64
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,400
of information uh but it's like some

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,980
statistics that are collected by some

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,319
peers in the industry regarding how much

67
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,340
money are get paid to those cyber

68
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,319
criminals so

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,540
um I wanted to ask a question to you to

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,760
all the audience um uh are there

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,099
ransomware attacks more complex than the

72
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,200
APT campaigns

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,659
um who thinks a ransomware attacks are

74
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,540
more complex than apt hands up

75
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,700
who thinks apt are more complex than

76
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,980
Samsung were attacks hands up that's

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,840
right guys so

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,720
where do we have the problem then I mean

79
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,420
if we are like uh or the industry is

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,900
like fighting with uh apt groups to in

81
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,840
order to not let them to attack us to

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,239
get our information to you to Big

83
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,819
fainted by them why why is that

84
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,879
ransomware like a topic that is all all

85
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,120
around the time around us and every

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,060
every week we are serving in our

87
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,659
Telemetry uh big teams uh that are

88
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,780
affected by by Ramson where and as well

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,580
as you of course if you are following

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,120
this topic and there is like uh like a

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,819
topic that we always uh describe in the

92
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,860
industry that is called

93
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,540
um the attack surface

94
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,000
um this is something more to be more

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
transparent it's something more like

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,740
what do we have publish it outside that

97
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,860
you are not protecting uh in a properly

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,620
Manner and and then someone find it and

99
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,380
exploit it and then you are infected you

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,780
have the passing zero lateral movement

101
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,380
actively compromised and then money for

102
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,040
the Transformer group in a short uh way

103
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,800
to explain it so we have to take care

104
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,600
about what is being published outside

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,419
there are many tools available you can

106
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,000
have your own vulnerabilities scanning

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,180
service to scan everything that you have

108
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,360
published outside you can use uh alerts

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,060
in Showdown on other let's say under

110
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,240
industry Tools in order to know uh what

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,460
you have published outside but the

112
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,400
listen if you enforce MFA if you

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,040
scan properly your infrastructure if you

114
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,259
reduce your attack surface you will be

115
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,320
less uh let's say let's say less

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,960
selected to be one of the big teams for

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,759
those cyber criminal groups because they

118
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,460
have an entire higher IPS space to

119
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,840
select one of the big things and they

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,460
will go for the ones that are more easy

121
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,660
for them

122
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,080
we have to separate from this let's say

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
equation of course zero days another

124
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,300
step that is like nobody could know

125
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,780
about it so uh then everybody

126
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,000
where it's possible to be like a victim

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,860
but for exploits like known exploits and

128
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,120
vulnerabilities or password spraying

129
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,580
attacks or liquid credentials on the

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,280
Underground forums we we have already

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,340
let's say Solutions in the market to to

132
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,880
to get right of those problems and make

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,220
the job for those guys more difficult

134
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,699
that's it that's the thing so how this

135
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,500
ecosystem of attacks works so basically

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,780
uh from one side we have the ransomware

137
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,180
operators these are the guys that will

138
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,520
be installing and deploying the ram

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
somewhere at the final stage in the in

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,240
the victims so they are usually usually

141
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,220
uh technical people really really

142
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,620
technical people well

143
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,680
um if we take the example from from The

144
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
ransomware Operators from the county

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,780
ransomware groups they had like hacking

146
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,539
guides in order to compromise people so

147
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,479
maybe they are not technical at all but

148
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,240
for other groups uh they we know that

149
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,280
they are really technical people that

150
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,840
they know what are they doing they know

151
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
how to how to do lateral movement and do

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,280
hacking inside the companies but from

153
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,440
one side we have those operators that

154
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,740
will be we will do like um the coin and

155
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,100
search task to to figure out what's the

156
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,100
company is running in terms of over or

157
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,440
how many employees a company have this

158
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,500
this part of enumeration is uh what

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,560
everybody does in a in um let's say

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,020
legit uh ethical hacking exercise for

161
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,720
for a company then they want to select

162
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,699
like a target of course they want to

163
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,940
select a Target that has money to to pay

164
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,520
the data because it it doesn't make any

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
sense that they attack a company that

166
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
doesn't have enough resources to to pay

167
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,180
the money in a change when they are

168
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,759
compromised and when the victim is

169
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,039
selected and the victim is let's say

170
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,660
compromised

171
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,380
um they ask for a high pay in order to

172
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,460
to get the data back if we take back uh

173
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,039
if we look at the past we could see the

174
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,520
evolution of how this business is

175
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,620
working right now at the beginning they

176
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,520
only encrypted the data and then

177
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,800
requested money in a change when they

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,180
figured out that the company is

179
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,240
increases the resilience in terms of

180
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,639
backups and stuff like that so when

181
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,380
company when a company was attacked they

182
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,720
were like meh I can restore the data I

183
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,819
don't care uh then they decided to

184
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,460
exfoliate the data before and and then

185
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,740
uh encrypt it in order to get the money

186
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,259
the money back and right now they are

187
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,440
like uh we are calling this right now uh

188
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,960
third uh extortion

189
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,659
um business whatever they are um sending

190
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,779
an email directly to the CFO in order to

191
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,719
say hey we know that you have money so

192
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,360
pay pay the bill you don't want to to

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,700
have your your data publish it so this

194
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,200
is this is the problem that we have

195
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
right now

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
talking about how they work internally

197
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
um from one side we have the developers

198
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,760
so they are they are like the the gurus

199
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,820
the the guys that are creating those uh

200
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,260
drum somewhere

201
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,300
um families and they are usually

202
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,519
creating something custom but sometimes

203
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,500
they are like grabbing code from other

204
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,980
families to take advantage of those

205
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,899
functionalities so every time we see a

206
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,779
ransomware family that is going down we

207
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,019
can see other families too like

208
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,580
parasites to take in this code and

209
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,519
implementing uh the the this has stolen

210
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,459
Coating in in in their own uh pieces so

211
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,399
meaning that they are also competing uh

212
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,200
between them because at the end it's

213
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,720
like uh yeah you have a like a big cake

214
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,779
of victims but if if I'm the major

215
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,360
ransomware group means that they will

216
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,700
get more Affiliates to work with me and

217
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,459
more money to to to split with my with

218
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,339
my people in order to I don't know to

219
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,620
increase my infrastructure to high mode

220
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,760
developers

221
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,580
etc etc and from the other side we have

222
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,560
the Affiliates these are the people that

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,920
will be in charge of um this also they

224
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,839
are called affiliate slash drum

225
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,700
somewhere operators um this will be the

226
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,980
people that will be in charge to deploy

227
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,560
and infect the companies we with the ram

228
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,260
somewhere they are splitting the payment

229
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,140
usually uh 30 percent to the to the

230
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,940
ransomware developers and the rest to

231
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,240
the uh to the Affiliates so meaning that

232
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
they are they can get a big part of the

233
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,100
of the money if they are succeed in the

234
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,440
operation of course inside of those

235
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,820
rules

236
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,100
um if we have an affiliate that is like

237
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,740
I don't know um if you remember for

238
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,779
example the attack that the colonial

239
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,240
pipeline suffered of course this

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,279
affiliate I'm sure they got another

241
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,519
person touching a change because they he

242
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,519
managed to get like a big beat him so we

243
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,040
could see also a special treatment for

244
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,339
Affiliates that are getting a lot of a

245
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,700
lot of victims and inside this picture

246
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,060
is not represented but we also have what

247
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,459
is called the initial access Brokers and

248
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,820
these are cyber criminal groups that are

249
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,339
compromising compromising companies

250
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,620
getting the access to to them and then

251
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,019
selling selling these access to other

252
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,300
cyber criminal groups that they don't

253
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,820
want to spend the time in hacking these

254
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,339
companies and they are also taking one

255
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,500
part of the person Touch of this money

256
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,560
that the victim will pay after the the

257
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,779
they are hit by by a ram somewhere

258
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,760
attack

259
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,680
and then on the other side of course we

260
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,560
have the the pure victims

261
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,120
so

262
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,640
we can we can use Mitra to analyze

263
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,620
Matrix like a framework that everybody

264
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,459
uh use nowadays it could be like super

265
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,040
cool for for companies that maybe they

266
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,160
don't they don't have like um like um

267
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
security uh Team inside and they want to

268
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,399
let's say invest part of their time to

269
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,120
increase the security uh maturity inside

270
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,820
the company so they can use Mitra in

271
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,320
order to

272
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,420
um let's say I want to fill a special

273
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,640
gaps and I don't know from where to

274
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,579
start you can use migrative to get rid

275
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,440
of it or maybe you are a security

276
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,380
researcher and you and you want you to

277
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,459
be able to attribute a family to to any

278
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,820
traductor or or or or or campaign you

279
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,880
can use also miter to compare the ttps

280
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
uh between families and and campaigns

281
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,899
and actors so this is um um like uh the

282
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,700
overview of the attack that they will be

283
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,860
explaining from one side we have the

284
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,220
criminal on the external perimeter from

285
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,019
the other side we have the different

286
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,200
ways where a criminal can compromise a

287
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,320
company he can do flower compromising

288
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,800
website or a Spam campaign or doing

289
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,680
bullet exploitation on the other side we

290
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
have the first Marvel that will be

291
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,760
deployed on the big team using Color

292
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,600
strike or maybe Empire to do a lateral

293
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,120
movement and then the Steeler and the

294
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
ramsen were execution

295
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,459
so this is um I will explain like a real

296
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,800
case that we had in Spain

297
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,500
um uh some time ago that we can now

298
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,620
disclose details about it and this is

299
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,360
the the page that uh the the guy from

300
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,620
the company uh got uh through an email

301
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,839
and he decided to open the link and then

302
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,660
he find out that this screen like you

303
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,579
have to update

304
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,880
um this your Google Chrome someone in

305
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,820
the public can spot any difference

306
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,399
between this page and the real one

307
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,339
don't tell me about the the JavaScript

308
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,120
below

309
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,760
the URL right the your the URL is like

310
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,940
um like one of the difference but I was

311
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,920
like doing a public joke because there

312
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,040
is no difference besides the URL and of

313
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,839
course the message below on the other

314
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,079
that don't execute this file because it

315
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
was already for the demo it was already

316
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
flagged by Chrome at that time but when

317
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,660
when this campaign uh was started uh

318
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,420
this Javascript file was uh undetected

319
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,260
by

320
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,240
mostly all the Security Solutions in the

321
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,180
market is practically then we have to

322
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,220
talk about

323
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,139
detecting this file dynamically in

324
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,540
execution in memory whatever but at that

325
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,540
time statically was food was fully

326
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,180
detected by by any security solution in

327
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,920
the market so the user decided to

328
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,600
of course agree with the with the page

329
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,360
and then click on update Google Chrome

330
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,899
hit a Noida file and this file

331
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,500
um was downloaded that was highly

332
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,639
obfuscated and the downloaded made or

333
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,459
did several things in the system uh

334
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,320
first it was checking if the assistant

335
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
was uh was a virtual machine because

336
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,079
they want to avoid to be part of a

337
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,980
Sandbox pipeline execution where we can

338
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,860
later flag the file and then add the

339
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,560
detection in our basis so the the money

340
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,199
that they invest to create this for

341
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,959
undetected file it will be lost so they

342
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,300
try to detect if the big team is worth

343
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,959
or not to be executed and also he the

344
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,260
downloaded executive the situ server was

345
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,360
active because imagine that you want to

346
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,279
download the second payload the second

347
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,500
stage and the city server is like

348
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,160
unavailable uh they activated whatever

349
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
so we don't need to do this callback if

350
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,260
there is a common control server is is

351
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,380
down so basically the the downloader was

352
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,000
doing several attacks in the system

353
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
before continuing the execution

354
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,180
uh this was the code uh

355
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,279
um if you open it with uh notepad plus

356
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,079
plus or whatever

357
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,139
and if you execute the the JavaScript

358
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:10,380
file this is the Callback that made to

359
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,839
the to the server it's interesting to

360
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,980
note this post request to a gif file and

361
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,240
then this content type application

362
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,380
formula coded so and also this a equal

363
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,040
this ID so they were able to identify

364
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,740
how many big teams or or the big team

365
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,380
that was behind this uh execution

366
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,180
because they want to track

367
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,459
if I'm a criminal I want to know I want

368
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,680
to have my own Google analytics right I

369
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,959
want to know how many buildings I I was

370
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
able to to compromise so this was the

371
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,399
Callback

372
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,579
um I I made a search on that time

373
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:51,600
um

374
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,300
okay so you can see it well uh so I made

375
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,540
I made a search at that time for a file

376
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,660
called Chrome uh underscore and then

377
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,760
positive plus five and txt file type and

378
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,559
I don't know if you can see it well but

379
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,799
there is like a few detections only for

380
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,439
some files it's not like uh the Bible

381
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,720
but uh it's like a thermometer that you

382
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,599
can use in order to measure how how a

383
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,699
campaign is like going on in terms of

384
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,740
detections for for everybody because

385
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,260
everyone is like uploading files to to

386
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,799
bios total so I usually use it to to to

387
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,799
measure the detections uh when the file

388
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,360
was uploaded in the platform so at that

389
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,140
time

390
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,419
um there are there were a lot of um a

391
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,640
lot of files that were like purely

392
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,620
detected

393
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,080
um digital loader um at that time uh

394
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,120
could download different type of malware

395
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,700
depending on the region and depending on

396
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,620
the time the that the loader was

397
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,200
executed it was controlled by the

398
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,140
command and control server and at that

399
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,799
time it was downloaded caller strike

400
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,539
readers and also a model that is called

401
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,860
CH tonic that is small is more known on

402
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,000
the banking Financial threats side and

403
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,700
it's curious because these guys were

404
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,080
using

405
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,179
um red teaming tools like cover strike

406
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,360
but also Financial malware like redex in

407
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,419
also to to to to let's say control

408
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,760
controller or or take control of the

409
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,679
remote computer in the in the company

410
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,140
and this is because of the capabilities

411
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,320
at reduction and CH tonic or Coalition

412
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,400
has that you can dump passwords uh get

413
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,100
the information from the memory control

414
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,720
the remote compute and execute command

415
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,240
and so this type of capabilities are

416
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,120
really interested for for those guys and

417
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,700
that's why they decided to use this kind

418
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,500
of tools

419
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,080
for one of the big teams we could see of

420
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,720
course uh the really famous mimikats

421
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,320
that is used to dump the credentials on

422
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,320
the Windows ecosystem and they are using

423
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,179
mimicals in order to get like pallet

424
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,580
credentials to continue doing lateral

425
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,000
movement and other operations uh inside

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,840
the inside the company and again I I

427
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,740
made a search at that time for all the

428
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,480
AV industry that had mimicals on their

429
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,900
detection name and also with less than

430
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,380
five positive and I also watch I I also

431
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,440
was able to find files that were

432
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,720
uploaded to to your wireless photo at

433
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
that time that had only a few detections

434
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,880
meaning that the the criminals are

435
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,880
trying to protect also those red teaming

436
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Tools in order to be let's say a stealth

437
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,880
of the at the at the victim side and so

438
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,919
be careful with with those things things

439
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,220
and there are yellow rows that can of

440
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,100
course uh scan and detect mimikats in

441
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,120
the memory so use them are not only like

442
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,059
a static analysis to detectify if a file

443
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,799
is a threat or not

444
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,039
if we want to like um for our knowledge

445
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,700
we want to know uh how which families or

446
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,299
which groups are using mimikats and data

447
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,160
tags you can use the mitral knowledge

448
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,039
base to get right of those to get those

449
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,320
information it could be also interesting

450
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,020
to to cross check the groups and our

451
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,500
sector if I'm like if I'm in the

452
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,960
healthcare sector I will have like only

453
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,360
certain groups that are attacking me or

454
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,460
maybe some ransomware groups are

455
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,919
specialized on the healthcare sector and

456
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,320
they are attacking them theoretically

457
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,780
they have their own rows to not do it

458
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,960
but Lockheed for example is like you can

459
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
do whatever you want so it's important

460
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,740
also to know this information

461
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,299
um they got in the groups you can also

462
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,740
check miter to to get this information

463
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,320
um regarding the the lateral movement

464
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
tools that are used this is uh this

465
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
Kings of Empire uh that is like uh post

466
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,600
Transportation tool that is used to to

467
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,620
automate certain things uh for I say

468
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,080
um sloppy uh ethical hackers

469
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,919
um that was still I'm kidding but um

470
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,679
um you have a lot of automations to to

471
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,840
to to to compromise other machines in

472
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
the in the network at least a framework

473
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,260
that this

474
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,740
super use in process partition campaigns

475
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,260
because uh it's giving a lot of

476
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,900
functionalities for for those Affiliates

477
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,840
that are trying to arrive to the to the

478
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,659
Valhalla to the active directory

479
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,240
um server to to compromise the entire

480
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,559
company so it's important to to be aware

481
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,780
about the usage of of these tools in

482
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,740
your internal Network

483
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,020
[Music]

484
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,840
we also um detected like custom uh

485
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
Powershell uh I mean not like a general

486
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,659
framework but scripts that are used to

487
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,799
to to execute uh lateral movement inside

488
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,380
the company so there is also common to

489
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,740
to find Alternatives that are uh coded

490
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,140
by an affiliate for example or an

491
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,080
initial access broker that is maybe I

492
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,600
don't know um they forgot the Powershell

493
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,419
file on the system or maybe in an

494
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,059
initial response case we are able to to

495
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,120
get this file also so it's important

496
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,480
also to to be able to detect these kind

497
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,640
of files in a later attack also Custom

498
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,460
Custom executions

499
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,860
regarding uh how they are getting

500
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
credentials upon they have it with

501
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,700
mimikats they will start the lateral

502
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,940
moment uh propagation they will also try

503
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,640
to fingerprint your entire network we we

504
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,059
also detected the usage of Bloodhound or

505
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,840
other like tools to to compromise uh the

506
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,179
entire the Dial Network and they will

507
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,280
try to actually trade data from the

508
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,679
system we are not talking about the

509
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,020
right now the files that are exfiltrated

510
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,200
prior uh the rational encryption but

511
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,080
other interesting file that maybe I

512
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,520
don't know an encrypted file that they

513
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,720
want to crack or data about a storage

514
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,820
passwords in a txt file that they want

515
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,640
to use later or important files that can

516
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,400
be used later to thread the company the

517
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
targeted company Below in the image you

518
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,700
can see an um a Powershell execution to

519
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,919
download an additional Powershell

520
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,380
template file in the in the system and

521
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,179
also to configure

522
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,580
um proxy inside inside the system

523
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,500
because sometimes they want to access to

524
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,960
special places inside the network and

525
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,299
they have to practice those connections

526
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,700
in order to jump over the network to to

527
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,760
other places imagine a network that is

528
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,559
air gap they don't have internet

529
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,720
connection but they want to at least

530
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,419
start the data but you can access from a

531
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,120
from a jump server and and you have

532
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,159
access there the entire network doesn't

533
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,679
have internet access but you can

534
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,260
um let's say um tunnel tunnel the data

535
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,780
through your proxy in order to to get

536
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,000
the data outside this is also possible

537
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,840
nowadays and the other image below is uh

538
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,280
on Windows management instruction

539
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,159
execution where they are getting

540
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,200
information if the machine contains

541
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,919
exchange or SQL processor running inside

542
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,380
the system to see okay this is could be

543
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,380
this uh an interesting machine to attack

544
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,600
um and finally what are they doing is to

545
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,179
arrive to the active directory and this

546
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,580
is like a question that I always get

547
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,860
from journalists or other people in the

548
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,780
in the industry how they are able to

549
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,080
compromise the entire company at once

550
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,900
and this is not another explanation that

551
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,840
they are like creating a skilled task in

552
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,299
the as a GPO task in the inductive

553
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,159
directory and they are putting the

554
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,679
binary in accessible folder and then

555
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,919
when all the systems are reviewed the

556
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,720
the binary is executed and the entire

557
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,740
company is encrypted is as easy as is

558
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,419
they are they know how to administrate

559
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,159
systems as well

560
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,200
for the bad side

561
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,260
so this is like the general thing that

562
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,559
everybody sees around somewhere now that

563
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,320
we'll tell the user okay your data was

564
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,900
encrypted your company was hacked you

565
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,940
can contact us using protonmail or

566
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,000
tutanata or other

567
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Anonymous email provider or you can find

568
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,659
your company listed on this uh blog page

569
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,820
or whatever in the torn Network

570
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,380
this college work in um nowadays

571
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,460
so how are doing data as filtration so

572
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,220
we could see different uh tools

573
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,020
available in the market

574
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,059
um these are General tools that are used

575
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,419
by System administrators we can see

576
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,240
transmit for Mac users

577
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,400
filezilla for Windows and Linux users

578
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
and other clone that is used for Windows

579
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,460
user that is there are tools use it for

580
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,159
for other purposes like I want to change

581
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,980
files with an FTP server if I want to

582
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,860
send files to this another remote server

583
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,640
whatever but the the there are also

584
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,799
criminals using those tools because I

585
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,500
mean they they have only they have only

586
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,960
update the data uploaded data and and

587
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,980
that's it

588
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,220
but they are also using a custom tooling

589
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,100
so they are developers at the end so

590
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,760
they instead of use one of those tools

591
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,559
um they they prefer it to develop their

592
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,600
own tool to do Darkness filtration and

593
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,460
they can control the entire workflow

594
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,860
about how the data Refrigeration is

595
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,400
performed so I will show you two groups

596
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,140
two example where groups that are doing

597
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,120
this

598
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,360
and like two tools that are used to to

599
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,220
do data filtration

600
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,220
from one side we have Rebel and wizards

601
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,120
uh driver is one of was one of the major

602
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,480
uh groups also known as Selena kiwi also

603
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,700
for maybe someone in the audience saying

604
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,580
no no it but my other name this was one

605
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,279
of the major groups that was impacting

606
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,100
and attacking our companies and they and

607
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,380
we discovered uh at that time a till

608
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,159
called research we debrief our customers

609
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,400
about it and it was like a data

610
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,580
filtration tool that was used to as

611
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,299
filtrate data based on extensions and

612
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,220
that are that were that were present in

613
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,020
the in the system

614
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,559
um on the image at the top you can see

615
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,440
another screenshot about how is getting

616
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,720
the logical uh diverse things in the in

617
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,820
the system and Below part of the code

618
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,520
about the extension that the research

619
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,059
was seeking at that time I have to say

620
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,120
that research is like a really fast tool

621
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,240
to be honest to do um data filtration

622
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,360
and it was used by all the all the

623
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,299
Affiliates to to to go to West filtrate

624
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,059
data on a victim so all the Affiliates

625
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,760
they have like a panel uh where they can

626
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,520
download the the ransomware that they

627
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,100
will use to compromise the companies and

628
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,159
at that time they had another option to

629
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,260
download also visit so it's not like

630
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,419
mandatory to use it

631
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,400
I mean they are cyber equivalent they

632
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,220
can do whatever they want but uh the the

633
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,220
group tried to to give tooling to the

634
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,919
Affiliates in order to help them to get

635
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,779
more victims so it's like the company

636
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:59,039
helping the workers so so at that time

637
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,020
they they provided research to the

638
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,299
people to to use it at the beginning

639
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,480
they are only uh giving this tool a

640
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,000
little VIP Affiliates to test it and

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,559
when they test it done they are

642
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,679
activating this option for everybody

643
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,190
foreign

644
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,390
[Music]

645
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,740
the workflow that uh research was doing

646
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,020
in the machine when it was in execution

647
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,940
and we can see

648
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,460
um a function that will

649
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,120
um

650
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,880
uh let's say explore the entire disk of

651
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,120
the system to get all the possible file

652
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,299
candidates in order to be infiltrated

653
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,600
it was quite interesting for us about

654
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,940
how the data was exfiltrated at that

655
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,399
time because research business was

656
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,940
splitting the data in chunks in order to

657
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,659
to get to be able to exfiltrate also big

658
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,740
files and and not be able to be detected

659
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,980
and this was the the post that was uh

660
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,340
made by by by research the destination

661
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,039
files is a PHP file on a remote server

662
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,159
and this is a file encoded that is being

663
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,100
sent to the to the server

664
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,860
um research was identifying the victim

665
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,520
so every time I mean there's still the

666
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,159
data was in a in a folder for a victim

667
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,140
so they are organizing things on their

668
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,559
side in a little later uh publish this

669
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,020
data if the victim doesn't pay the the

670
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,240
rescue

671
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,880
and the other the other group is uh log

672
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,039
bit

673
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,799
is uh the other the other group that is

674
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,779
uh nowadays Super Active I mean they are

675
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,659
um attacking still a lot of companies

676
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,899
they are investing a lot of money in in

677
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,260
marketing this is a page about uh one

678
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,779
publication they decided to to make in

679
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:00,480
the adding girl forums the garden how is

680
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,059
their expectation tool compared to the

681
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,960
others in the market

682
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,600
as you can see they are the winners

683
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,179
right they are the winners about uh

684
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,520
compared to other tools in the market as

685
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,100
you can see they compared like the most

686
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,240
used

687
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,360
tools uh by Affiliates so they decided

688
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,620
to to check hey um this tool is used not

689
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,960
um should we compare it or not and they

690
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,720
were discussing internally about how

691
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,600
which tool they should compare and they

692
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,840
they marketing team was creating this

693
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,480
table description to to Showcase all the

694
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,799
Affiliates this application for the

695
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,080
Affiliates like listen guys if you want

696
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,299
to get a lot of money you have to work

697
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,659
with me at the end they they they that

698
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,679
it's like

699
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,720
there is no like infinite number of

700
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,760
Affiliates in the market so if they if

701
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,220
they get all of them means other groups

702
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,340
they they will um get less victims less

703
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,320
money and they will get more money and

704
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,080
more victims so they have to also uh

705
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,240
excite uh other Affiliates to to work

706
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,360
with them when we analyze uh the

707
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,299
campaign at at that time uh we figured

708
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,779
out that the the the the the tool

709
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,120
created by by

710
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,700
um by luck with developers contained a

711
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,120
lot of code ported from from lockbit um

712
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,500
this is our

713
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,320
um ktae our threat contribution engine

714
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,700
that we use uh we and our customer use

715
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,520
to compare or less track attribution

716
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,000
basis on the static code analysis and as

717
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,039
you can see at that time uh the 32

718
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,520
percent of uh log bit was present in the

719
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,100
industrial with uh code and this is like

720
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,620
quite funny because they are like a

721
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,000
developer team right they are taking

722
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,640
advantage of the code that they already

723
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,260
did

724
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,399
and estelvic was uh

725
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,679
they had like a pool of ips that they

726
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,600
used to

727
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
um send their data uh to the remote

728
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,840
server this is an example about using

729
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,320
fake dnes on remux on the

730
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,380
my left side and and also still with

731
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,600
running in the back mode you have to

732
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,179
select a special option to activate to

733
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,539
activate it to see because they they

734
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:30,240
sometimes are releasing uh debug samples

735
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,179
in order to test those those samples in

736
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,159
real environments so they want to know

737
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,580
if the what they created is working on a

738
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,340
real system so sometimes we can see

739
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,860
um the back compilations but in in this

740
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,580
case I still bit that is still use it

741
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,220
nowadays the sample contains like a pull

742
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,380
of a piece that the sample will try to

743
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,919
contact and when he find like an

744
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,700
unavailable AP

745
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:03,840
outside I have to say after analyze them

746
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,640
that they are probably they have

747
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,219
probably the the first The Faceless tool

748
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,159
in in the market I mean it's faster than

749
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,379
the than the research and it's faster

750
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,020
than other tools that we find other

751
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,239
custom tools that we find in the market

752
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,940
that is being used by my Ram somewhere

753
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,540
cyber criminals groups so

754
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,599
for the question what we can do

755
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,500
um

756
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,139
uh part of part of the team

757
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,679
um was part of the uh part of the let's

758
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,679
say the the workforce to create one uh

759
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,719
report that we released publicly for

760
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,239
everybody so you can download it you can

761
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,460
explode it you can ask ask questions if

762
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,918
you want and and we release this for

763
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,739
free for everybody and this is an

764
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,800
analysis of multiple drum somewhere

765
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,739
groups that are available outside and

766
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,020
this is a drill down about all the ttps

767
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,080
this is quite important or or because of

768
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,060
what is printed before you can use ttps

769
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,599
to take advantage about which defense I

770
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,680
have to apply in my in my company or or

771
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,440
in which ttps I should focus if I'm a

772
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,560
researcher to continue discovering more

773
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,079
activity from from these guys or if I

774
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,720
find raw data and I want to extract

775
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,359
attribution based on the ttps I can use

776
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:28,980
miter to to do it so uh on on my left

777
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,619
side you can see groups it's just

778
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,280
counting right it's a pizza

779
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,400
it's high flock bit uh Ragnar Locker

780
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,220
black bite black cat these are like the

781
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,560
major groups that that we had at that

782
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,700
time and it's like the drill down of

783
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,040
drum somewhere uh ttps that we that we

784
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,780
extracted so

785
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,640
um the the report is called common ttps

786
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,500
ransomware Casper in Google uh you will

787
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,400
find it

788
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,500
um and it's like um I think it's 40

789
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,800
pages report about the ttps described

790
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,820
for all of those groups and

791
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,640
the latest slide

792
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,460
who knows its pyramid of pain

793
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,020
who know it

794
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,020
is like the um we are talking about this

795
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,560
science years and this is like about

796
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,740
what we should focus in order to defend

797
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,220
our company so we want to take a look

798
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,040
about harsh values we can we can change

799
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,540
this highest value in five seconds

800
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,960
adding zeros adding zeros or oily number

801
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,540
at the end and then the hash will change

802
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,660
if you want to focus on IP IP address

803
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,780
the guy will just change to another IPS

804
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,720
page address space or or he will use

805
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,960
compromises websites is something to

806
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,140
take care of but um it can be changed

807
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,020
easily uh when we talk about domain

808
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,339
names

809
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,440
um this is like something more important

810
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,079
because if you want to you have

811
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,780
hard-coded a domain name in a sample

812
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,579
you have to release another sample

813
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,859
because if we deactivate this domain

814
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,200
name it means you you cannot use it

815
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,200
anymore so it's something like it's more

816
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,320
important to to flag it and block it if

817
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,240
we go to network artifact it's something

818
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,720
that is more complicated also to to your

819
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,000
block if we go to tooling at the end

820
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,060
behind this campaign we are they are

821
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,160
humans and

822
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
I'm comfortable working with mac and

823
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,520
comfortable not bringing my adapter to a

824
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,300
conference so it means that it will be

825
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,680
hard for me to change to another

826
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,720
operating system to another tool to

827
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,780
another tooling so it will be something

828
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,940
hard for them to change so it's

829
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,640
something that if we identify it it

830
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,520
means that we will be able to track them

831
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,480
mostly all the times and also ttps about

832
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,180

841
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,480
behind it we will be able to track them

842
