1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,740
on this talk we're going to talk about

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,540
the latest and wildest iot attacks I've

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,780
observed over the last year

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,620
specifically it was starting about

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,200
recent years but just last year we've

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,420
been enough to to make a hell of a talk

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,740
so

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,100
with that in mind let's Dive In

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,100
so first about me my name is Brock

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,080
Steinberg I'm a Founder at White pointer

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,740
Security Services Company I also have

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,399
this funny title of akarin residence at

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,280
Venture Capital wild Ventures

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,559
uh I was offered at sentiment one labs

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,980
and speaker at conferences and and love

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,260
sharing knowledge and working with uh

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,420
with people towards that I did my

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,700
masters in algorithms in in computer

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,160
science and I love doing research from

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
algorithms to analyze manager in the

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,100
wild and much much more

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,980
um I'm also a DJ and party lover so make

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,300
sure you check out my Mixcloud

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,640
afterwards

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,580
and that's it so with that in mind iot

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,939
attacks so iot attacks are anywhere

27
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,460
literally anywhere

28
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,760
increased over these uh so much

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,740
um so

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,500
why attackers are threatening and

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,680
targeting iot infrastructure so first

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,020
they possess so many critical systems

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,900
inside of them so it increased the

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,600
probability for more damage more damage

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
more probability

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,680
to payouts because it's a critical

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,600
infrastructure and you need it to be

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,540
recovered fast so maybe ransomware

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,159
attackers thinking about that as well

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,500
critical damage also nation-state

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,320
involved of course if they want to harm

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
some damage second it's harder to detect

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
and protect and they have this unique

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,500
environments and architectures it can

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,140
also give initial compromise initial

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,299
access to Organization for example the

47
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,180
iot the iot router VPN servers or

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,179
um or many uh devices like that can give

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,959
you uh in to enter the the environment

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,180
the organization and the scale many

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,760
devices have the same configuration all

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,220
over again because you don't really know

53
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,620
how to configure everything on the deep

54
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,459
inside of these iot devices so many of

55
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,500
these are completely the same

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,739
environment perspective

57
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,800
so what are attackers using that for so

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,420
first deploying ransomware double

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,980
extortions many many stuff like that

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,140
that deploying DDOS attacks

61
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,760
still in a source called technological

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,620
source code and much more crypto mining

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,900
damaging critical infrastructure we're

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
gonna see that and much much more so

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,300
according to Kaspersky report more than

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,459
billion attempts to infection has been

67
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,500
done on the first half of 2021 and the

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,959
most targeted industry not surprising

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,239
critical manufacturers large companies

70
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,819
and Facilities

71
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,040
hundreds of cves as well

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,800
so our first White story is going to be

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,040
about well yes the Ukraine Invasion by

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,959
Russia but specifically on the cyber

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,300
warfare behind all of that and the

76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,819
industry or two so recap uh the the

77
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,239
attack starting targeted uh Banks

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,180
government entities internet satellites

79
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,780
energy providers actually what is what

80
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,360
was critical was targeted so they tried

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,299
to Target Target anything uh

82
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,480
specifically when I mean them I mean

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
Russians

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,159
to do Ukrainian critical infrastructures

85
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,819
and they try to disable electricity well

86
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,299
virgin's the only tried they disabled

87
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,940
satellite internet connectivity they

88
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,459
damaged and why political infrastructure

89
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,580
data from uh for making it slow recover

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,340
and they use so many different malwares

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,739
developed For the First time seen there

92
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,220
in the story of two which was uh I will

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,100
discuss it much much more later

94
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,139
which was controlling able to control

95
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,800
iot devices that there are the power

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,660
grid and substations to make them

97
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,800
unavailable and damage them wipers

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,979
multiple OS versions and also they've

99
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,680
disabled the services inside this PC so

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,080
whenever they reach to some computer

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
network

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,919
they would disable or communication

103
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,259
outgoing and in-going so for example if

104
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,820
it's a Linux server it would be much

105
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,100
harder to recover gain control of the

106
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,060
system and try to recover the the damage

107
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,060
that has been done currently uh that's

108
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,400
the way the the wipers would work like

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
disable Communications wipe all the

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,479
system and then it's harder to get back

111
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,540
so a little bit intro about the group is

112
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,639
soon to be behind it the send room apt

113
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560
group uh they soon to be the part of the

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,840
giu uh wanted by the FBI as well unit

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,479
74455 multiple attack since 2007 causing

116
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,000
blackout in Ukraine Adidas ransomware

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
and much much more

118
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
so on these scenarios uh the main

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,340
efforts we're focusing on first the

120
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,440
banking Ukraine governments usually

121
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,800
we've intentioned to make the most harm

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,380
they could do using the caddy wiper and

123
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,560
their medical wiper uh the caddy wiper

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,259
is the Rd swiper for the windows the

125
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,320
aromatic wiper was uh was another

126
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,500
version uh doing doing uh doing that and

127
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,300
also they're using uh Linux wipers to uh

128
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,580
maliciously harm and and destroy all

129
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,300
these in in Solaris in Orca environments

130
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
in uh in Linux servers and much more

131
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,780
energy providers were attacked as well

132
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,400
uh of course also by the in destroyers

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,080
and the caddy wiper in a second version

134
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
um so much much attack has been done

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,280
concurrently uh the first line of

136
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,080
attacks I want to speak about is that

137
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,580
the wipers themselves so the first

138
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,180
Cherry wiper was an interesting piece of

139
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,520
malware recursively iterate in the Years

140
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,039
overwriting maximum of 10 megabytes

141
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,259
probably to make it faster

142
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,600
remember keep in mind the main intention

143
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,880
was to just make your computer

144
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
unavailable for the longest period they

145
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,400
could to make the most damage they use

146
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,800
write file with zero just Cisco right

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,080
price with zeros they also rewrite the

148
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,139
old partition table the MBR and the GPT

149
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,560
to zero again and the second version has

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,020
its own loader I don't know if it's a

151
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,240
kind of a trolling mechanism but they

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,759
use their patched Ida debugger binary

153
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,360
they use the win32 remotes binary from

154
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,360
the the plugin from Ida and patched it

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,060
with their own Shell Code loader they

156
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,840
use also a key and a circle path is an

157
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,419
argument to decrypt the Shell Code on

158
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,060
the Fly and also a time to execute any

159
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,800
actually that's an interesting point

160
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,780
because that's the way they try to avoid

161
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,180
a scheduled tasks so they didn't use

162
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,340
scalar stocks in this in second version

163
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680
but just using this time to X acute

164
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
argument and execute it after some time

165
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
probably has passed okay the Linux

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,660
wipers were using like uh leaving off

167
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,520
the land kind of techniques uh the

168
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,199
shredder Shredder binaries they use DD

169
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,520
um like to completely destroy uh uh out

170
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,620
drives they do it primarily they disable

171
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,479
also the communication as I told you and

172
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
they also try to remove system the unit

173
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,979
configurations to make sure no Auto

174
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,259
reloads are at the name so this is part

175
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,419
of this bash scripts inside

176
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,360
so this was the wipers what about the in

177
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,479
Destroyer itself so timeline speaking we

178
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,580
don't know much because not much was

179
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,099
actually published out there but Russia

180
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,280
invades Ukraine on the 24th of February

181
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,400
until the end it is uh pursuing that

182
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,259
send home apt compromised some energy

183
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,960
facility with high voltage substations

184
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,300
and the attack starts actually on the

185
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,340
8th of February

186
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,379
um so when the attack is starting they

187
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,479
try to do a scheduled task it is

188
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,659
immediately actually as we know detected

189
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,179
and removed and only a couple of days

190
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,219
after the Ukraine said informs about it

191
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,219
and one day after actually the FBI then

192
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,200
say many groups like that actually

193
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,060
inform about the new threat about the

194
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,800
new uh malware that might would be used

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,899
might want to be used called pipe dream

196
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,080
which can actually have much more damage

197
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,279
fortunately we didn't see any evidence

198
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,279
for it in the white so the industry to

199
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,320
just recall it uh goes way back to 2016

200
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,700
uh caused the blackout for an hour an

201
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,800
hour in the Ukrainian capital and this

202
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,279
cool ability to speak IEC 104 I see 110

203
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,640
uh OPC away many many like kind of PLC

204
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,339
ICS protocols it directly controls

205
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,380
switches and circuit breakers I think

206
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,140
one of the most uh amazing point about

207
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,540
this uh about this attack is that they

208
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,720
were trying to uh maliciously harm the

209
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,240
protection relays so they use this zero

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,720
day to destroy the protection relays

211
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,880
closed and shut down switch off all the

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,580
electricity devices and then when you

213
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,620
manually open up these electricity

214
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,899
devices all your system would break up

215
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,120
because you don't have protection relays

216
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,080
so they used zero day specifically here

217
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,380
dcv those packets Siemens to uh crush

218
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,080
the protection relays inside the system

219
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,779
and you can see actually uh or it's from

220
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,700
the beautiful dragons paper on the left

221
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,880
you can see a crushed those pocket crash

222
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,060
device after sending this doors packet

223
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,220
this was the in Destroyer the first

224
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,560
installer and now we go a little bit

225
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,560
high level in a sense for electricity

226
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,540
grow electric growth agreed their

227
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,320
operations so like in a deep kind of

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
sense we have discovered the Scout

229
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
clients controlling the security and

230
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,380
stuff like that they usually speak well

231
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,540
sometimes they speak with a tcpap

232
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,120
connection this is just an extension to

233
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,899
the real ICS protocol which is IEC 101

234
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,660
so the scada kinds communicate with the

235
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,899
router the IEC 104 router which actually

236
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,600
transfer and convert the communication

237
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,279
itself into the IEC 101 protocol and

238
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,800
being sent to the rtu so on the third

239
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
bullet here you can see the rtus which

240
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,019
are directly connected in Sands to the

241
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,060
substations to the electricity

242
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,760
electrical substations and therefore

243
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,100
from controlling the scada system you

244
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
can infiltrate and cause damage to the

245
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,880
rtus cool so in much more higher level

246
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,420
this is how probably a templated kind of

247
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,140
uh energy facility electricity energy

248
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,120
facility would look like so an

249
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,399
innovation facility would compromise uh

250
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,120
would uh compromise for many uh composed

251
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,740
from excuse me for many many things

252
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,579
inside so the HMI uh the the energy in

253
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,579
the engineer workstation OPC servers

254
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,620
much much more many of them working

255
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,620
again as TCP connection through the

256
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,200
router to the slaves the ltus some

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,079
communicate fully with the PLC the OPC

258
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,540
with its own protocol to the plcs

259
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,079
themselves and what the attackers try to

260
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,360
do in the first in Destroyer also in the

261
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,860
second we didn't manage that

262
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,640
successfully in the second fortunately

263
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,800
they try to attack any of them they try

264
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
to use any of them to shut down the

265
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,959
facility and not just shutting it down

266
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,200
but to damage it for the the longest the

267
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,579
longest they could

268
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,380
so the original 10 by the may also asset

269
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,940
blackhead talk this year was uh that the

270
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,160
original intent was to de-energize the

271
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,339
power lines uh deny operators visibility

272
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,500
and control this was the original intent

273
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,420
in the new version they were also trying

274
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,220
to wipe all the outrights and all the

275
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,700
artists so even if you could like get

276
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,320
control again of your system of your

277
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,600
scada it would be much much harder to

278
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
recover and make control again because

279
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,700
you don't have uh you don't have all the

280
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,959
system you need you don't have the

281
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,720
binaries they disable the protection

282
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,180
layers and waited waited for what for

283
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,459
manual operation many operations done

284
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,560
and then physical damage would cause

285
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
because the protection the protection

286
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,660
relays are now going to be disabled they

287
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,440
actually involve it with more fins but

288
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,940
it's if you want to read it it's it's

289
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,980
more in the asset paper they they try to

290
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,040
switch on and off multiple times of the

291
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,399
substations to make abruptions in the in

292
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
the power grids themselves so auto

293
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,560
shutdown of specific substations will

294
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,700
occur

295
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,940
that's that's astonishing a way to do

296
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,519
that so in this story to specifically

297
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,220
reverse engineering is the story to uh

298
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,200
shows us many many interesting things

299
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
they're doing task scheduling that was

300
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,540
detected uh and the logs debugs log

301
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,240
anywhere like a little bit obscure but

302
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,120
kind of understandable non-privileged

303
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,920
account was needed so no admin account

304
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,380
because they were speaking through the

305
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,600
internet like that sorry the land

306
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,779
communication through the router

307
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,060
themselves so no admin access was needed

308
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,160
you can actually see that on the XML

309
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,740
schema which is the correspond to this

310
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,459
task scheduler on the right here

311
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,639
um so uh this was in Destroyer too and

312
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,139
its way of operation dynamically

313
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,139
speaking we can see here uh how it works

314
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,600
so the the as we know there are two

315
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,019
samples uh targeting around 11

316
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:21,620
substations uh with this TCP IEC 100 104

317
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,360
protocol they knew from before

318
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,639
everything they want to do and this is a

319
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,459
key point they knew what other says they

320
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,980
want to Target they knew uh the devices

321
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,139
they knew the iOS the new internal

322
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,180
physical things they want to attack they

323
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,820
add this knowledge it's like they have

324
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,699
this routine looping all over again just

325
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,360
trying to make the things their own way

326
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,220
they actually funny thing is that they

327
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,779
don't even kind of listen to the

328
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,380
responses which is more like giving you

329
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,660
the feeling that they didn't really need

330
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,660
that they they had the all the

331
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,100
assumptions they had all the knowledge

332
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,320
they needed before

333
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,180
so you you can see the the packet sniff

334
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,579
from the in Destroyer 2 and this way of

335
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,120
fork just shutting down things on and

336
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,399
off corresponding to what they want to

337
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,959
do so I I don't know like we don't know

338
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,540
sorry we don't know specifically what

339
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,380
was the purpose in every single

340
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,380
ltu on and off switch but we for sure

341
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,120
know that some of them were trying to

342
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,940
Target it by kind of island island kind

343
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,160
of attacks there's on and off with goes

344
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,519
on because the uh much much things would

345
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,639
be in the system overuse of the system

346
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,459
uh and and would make crashing happens

347
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,800
the off switches were probably for the

348
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,420
protection relays to make them not

349
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,600
working so again when they manually turn

350
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,820
on switch will turn on an arm would

351
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,320
cause because the protection relays

352
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
protect you from high voltage and

353
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
shortages and stuff like that okay so

354
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,000
this is about the in Destroyer too

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,959
an interesting ttps attack is used

356
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
they enumerate

357
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,899
rules domain gpus and domain using a

358
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,240
non-admin required technique with adci

359
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,459
adapter in Powershell and we're doing

360
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,139
schedule tasks without task scheduler

361
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,120
and they have prepared passwords and iot

362
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,920
addresses and they're doing this cool

363
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,199
mimicas no mimikats technique to dump

364
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,860
credentials with the mini dump technique

365
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,380
really cool really cool technique

366
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,959
actually to use kind of again leaving of

367
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,639
the land counter technique to me to get

368
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,079
credentials and passwords

369
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,320
okay so this was our first story uh our

370
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,380
next story is going to be about uh well

371
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,820
the unfortunate attack about the Ireland

372
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,839
hospitals so the HSC attack on 2021 uh

373
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,600
started as the attack about the old

374
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,899
Public Health institution in England

375
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,540
more than the HSC compo comprised of

376
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,439
more than 35 hospitals around 70k

377
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,500
employees the high level attack is quite

378
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,619
simple fishing malicious Excel being

379
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,859
opened by uh by employee attackers are

380
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,480
inside eight weeks in the network later

381
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,480
moving I.T ignoring alerts

382
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,179
big mess out there and one County run

383
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,140
somewhere starts up at a single moment

384
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,059
so the higher level attack story you can

385
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,520
see the image here as well the fishing

386
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,600
uh the fishing opportunity gave gave a

387
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,220
chance to attackers to do what they want

388
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,500
the attacker just wander around the

389
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,960
network for more than eight weeks they

390
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,360
deploy eventually they run somewhere but

391
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,179
it was much much after they compromised

392
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,820
so many systems and servers in the

393
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,320
network

394
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,280
so on the 19th of May the CEO of HSC is

395
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,580
going out uh as a press release and he

396
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,059
says that well attack has occurred we

397
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,720
don't know uh what data was taken we we

398
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,140
know uh some data was taken

399
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,880
um and we won't pay

400
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
that's not a good that's not a good PR

401
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
release it's like it's really make uh

402
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,940
many many people like unclear and unsure

403
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,280
of what is happening really behind the

404
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,640
hood and it makes sense because middle

405
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,740
of the day they didn't know anything

406
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,660
almost as far as I know at that moment

407
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,480
so the timeline is again so phishing

408
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,559
email

409
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,220
um

410
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,140
clicked on merge 18 open up

411
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,140
sorry the Excel file in the email

412
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,200
on the end of on the end of March the

413
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,760
attacker execute Cobra strike and

414
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,260
mimikats Cobra so I can remember cuts

415
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,320
out of the box the AV oh amazing AV

416
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,900
monitor mode style doesn't block

417
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,559
anything great job on the 7th of May

418
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
look the timeline it's like there have

419
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
been so many so many time in the network

420
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,919
so so much time in the network the

421
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,720
attacker first gained admin privileges

422
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,220
probably with known password so the

423
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,440
attacker goes on looking over the dark

424
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,080
web uh finding the password and go back

425
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,440
and just enter the password amazing on

426
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,179
the 8th that I can continue lateral

427
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,520
movement exploit more servers in more

428
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,440
hospitals

429
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,620
um on the 10th again attacker execute

430
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Cobra strikes at One hospital so it

431
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,900
execute the cover strike the antivirus

432
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,940
detects that it doesn't run in monitor

433
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,620
mode and

434
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,780
quarantine fails

435
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,299
quarantine fails like

436
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,580
well

437
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
it's a mess

438
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,400
so the whole story is about really

439
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,980
showing or really shown here that the

440
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,840
cyber security maturity level was not

441
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,880
enough it was really really not enough

442
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,700
on the 10th of May One hospital stock

443
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,679
actually noticed again corbel Striker

444
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,419
that So eventually the soft team get

445
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,160
involved they asking the security

446
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,140
provider whoever they should be

447
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,059
concerned but the security for everybody

448
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,460
says that well we removed the Cobra

449
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,340
strike from your OPC so the risk is low

450
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,559
what with other PCS what if other

451
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,780
networks what we've cleaning up the PC

452
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,320
itself nothing so the the whole

453
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,440
corresponding about the security was way

454
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,860
way uh better in my perspective attacker

455
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,260
again one day after attacker brute first

456
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,720
domain passwords it fails and then

457
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,780
execute one one day popular one day

458
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,539
successfully on the system because

459
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,160
systems were kind of a medical Mimi

460
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,660
system so no updates uh many many times

461
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,360
no updates so uh system were really

462
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
unupted

463
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,160
and updated use antivirus rules and much

464
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,740
much more uh I think one of the most

465
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,140
astonishing thing is that on the 13th of

466
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,320
May uh the security provider itself said

467
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,660
to the soccer team look you have

468
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,240
intrusion to your system they are there

469
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,799
are threat actors threatening in your

470
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,400
system cover strike stuff whatever and

471
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,299
you know what they did they just

472
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,360
restarted the servers they just get get

473
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,460
the server team and tell them okay we

474
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,440
have we haven't compromise so let's do

475
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
full-on restart

476
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,559
that's really really bad

477
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,480
uh one more thing it's all but by the

478
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,720
way it's all based on the PWC report uh

479
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,520
uh over 160 Pages amazing to read so

480
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,380
many conclusions so many things to to

481
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,840
get from it and understand how we need

482
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
to do better security uh one Hospital

483
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,340
detects the attack it twisted all the

484
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,140
password you do do all things correctly

485
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,220
but it doesn't inform any other hospital

486
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,280
it doesn't inform any other systems any

487
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,700
other uh

488
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,799
networks so it protects itself the

489
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,900
hospital but it doesn't help the others

490
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,960
they don't share the knowledge

491
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,940
uh on the 13th day execute ransomware

492
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,760
with all the exploited hospitals this is

493
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,440
about the quantity ransomware so the

494
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,120
county ransomware encrypts file

495
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,440
parallelly

496
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,059
um it used the charger 8 cinematic

497
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,340
encryption it removed backups it

498
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,559
actually have this cool ability to

499
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,980
encrypt uh uh remotely the backups in

500
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,500
the Vim backups but probably for more uh

501
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,840
service backups as well it removed

502
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,659
backups also locally it also look all

503
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,419
over them it also have this cool partial

504
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,220
encryption feature to make it probably

505
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,159
faster and and avoidable and

506
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,820
non-detectable in a sense so it do

507
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,299
encryption with jumps of of one megabyte

508
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,159
each so it doesn't encrypt anything it

509
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,260
just encrypts part of it but it will

510
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,720
still doesn't help you to recover your

511
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,080
systems right it's all its needs uh it's

512
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,740
it's all what it needs cool

513
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,500
um so the impact was really bad uh many

514
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,240
cancellations ctxris uh x-ray x-ray MRI

515
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,100
appointments and many many more can sell

516
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,900
because the I.T system was interrupted

517
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,600
uh I think more than 20 hospitals

518
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,179
infected also comments in the web which

519
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,059
made me many cry because like people

520
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,860
waiting for treatments and then cyber

521
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,240
security attack happens and they can't

522
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,140
get the treatment uh eventually uh um

523
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,860
the attacker uh I don't know if they

524
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,500
they gain conscious but they sent out

525
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,659
the keys eventually because they tell

526
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,880
them we don't pay they send out the keys

527
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,700
but still it didn't help because it took

528
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,520
so long to recover the whole systems so

529
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,520
in conclusion more than 20 hospitals got

530
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,460
impacted uh appointment and I.T system

531
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,559
got shut down the academic demand

532
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,179
initially 20 90 million dollars but sent

533
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,659
out the keys uh not nevertheless we

534
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,780
without payout it took them three months

535
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,120
to recover more than thousand servers

536
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,520
and thousand different applications

537
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
really really bad attack estimated

538
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,900
damages without even the payouts for the

539
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,140
ransomware itself for more than 600

540
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,039
million dollars as estimated out there

541
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,100
and also data leaks for 500 internal

542
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,960
records and stuff

543
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,659
so the red flags and Main takeaways from

544
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,520
this is well configure your security

545
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,460
tools do updates

546
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,659
um they didn't have uh rules new rules

547
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,220
for the antivirus for more than 12

548
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,559
months

549
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,380
regard regarding like besides the the

550
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,980
the fin that they use antivirus they

551
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,640
they don't have edrs so like

552
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,740
increase your cyber security maturity

553
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,880
level uh get personal and highly highly

554
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,460
skilled personnels that can help you

555
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,240
mitigate threats prioritize and prepare

556
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,100
for the walls prepare for the Emergency

557
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,740
prepared for emergency plan and

558
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,600
communicate

559
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,700
uh with that in mind we're going to our

560
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,860
last attack so our last attack is going

561
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,740
to deal with the colonial oil pipeline

562
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,260
attack uh the current old piping attack

563
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,260
is a really interesting attack it starts

564
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,559
with well Colonial who so Colonial is

565
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,600
actually one of the biggest oil

566
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,179
companies which is a part of the

567
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,520
colonial group you can actually see here

568
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,340
in the map where the pipeline is

569
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,320
actually moving forward and you can see

570
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,520
that uh

571
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,760
around 50 of the fuel in the east coast

572
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
in the United States uh is using this

573
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,940
pipeline so this is a really critical

574
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,340
infrastructure if these things get hurt

575
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,520
something really really bad can go uh

576
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,919
and happen they are the largest pipeline

577
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,200
system for refined oil they they

578
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,299
transfer oil probably also gas and Fuel

579
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,059
and much much more

580
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,419
and on the 19th they shut down their

581
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,779
pipeline so what's happening uh probably

582
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,720
assumed to be the the PC managing the

583
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,880
colonial pipeline got attacked by one

584
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,380
somewhere uh and and attacked really bad

585
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,779
and they decided to minimize exposure

586
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,419
shut down the whole system they were

587
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,080
just using unused VPN password unused

588
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,840
VPN username and password

589
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,640
they found it in the dark web

590
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,980
they don't they didn't have uh

591
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,600
multi-factor Authentication

592
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,900
that's it that's all needed to

593
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,360
infiltrate one of the huge systems the

594
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
huge critical infrastructure in the

595
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,700
states responsible for the oil pipelines

596
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,799
that's really astonishing also the Biden

597
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,380
and the FBI uh was corresponding and

598
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,200
involved immediately so the FBI and by

599
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,020
then are really like mad right now and

600
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,360
they are in that point of time they are

601
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,860
really involved in all of that working

602
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,100
together with Colonial on the sixth uh

603
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,380
the first institution intrusion is uh

604
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,460
presumed to be a data is stolen and also

605
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,860
leaked at the dark web itself

606
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,940
um and to again to uh to convince them

607
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,820
that the threat is exist and to convince

608
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,140
them to pay

609
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,260
and on the seventh the ransomware

610
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,200
actually starts uh the U.S government is

611
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,840
involved in all of that the pipeline is

612
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
taken down to minimize the exposure and

613
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,620
couple of hour laters they pay so over

614
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,640
supervised by the FBI they pay around

615
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,020
four uh 4.4 million dollars 75 Bitcoin

616
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,539
at the time uh to these threat actors

617
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,940
supervised by the FBI remember that

618
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,940
point we will come to that later so uh

619
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,059
only five days after the pipeline was

620
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,559
fully restored

621
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,679
and like if you take down a whole

622
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,900
Pipeline and it takes you five days to

623
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,279
restore that

624
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,400
it can cause problems it can cause real

625
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,700
real problems so we talk about these

626
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,799
problems a little bit later now I want

627
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,020
to speak about the APT group the APT

628
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,360
group behind it is soon to be a kind of

629
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,779
a Russian Related Group Dark Side black

630
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,620
matter uh dark side was the the kind of

631
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,360
the old named black matter is the the

632
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,580
new uh the new thing

633
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,260
um they seem to work on from Eastern

634
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,720
Europe or Russia uh operators around

635
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,580
somewhere as a service so they can

636
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,320
compile for you the binaries and the

637
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,360
ransomware you need if you give them the

638
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,220
initial access they can manage the

639
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,620
operation behind the ransomware attacks

640
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,779
themselves you can see here an example

641
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,520
of uh of a note they leave

642
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,620
and interestingly enough the way they

643
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,320
walk the malware itself uh you can see

644
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,120
that they delete the shadow copies the

645
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,039
windows Shadow copies they delete all

646
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,380
the backup Services as well they uh

647
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,120
query all these backup services and

648
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,760
delete them one by one and they use fast

649
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,159
symmetric encryption

650
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,140
um they have their publicly embedded

651
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,620
inside uh inside the the mirror itself

652
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,360
so the private key is only in their

653
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,080
server in their side and when they come

654
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,659
into some PC and some computer they

655
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,840
generate randomly generated uh symmetric

656
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,440
keys in a good manner back then it

657
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
wasn't that good but now it's a good

658
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,059
manner they encrypt this symmetric keys

659
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,820
with the public infrastructures and

660
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,039
remove from the disk and delete all

661
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
these symmetric key from the disk itself

662
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,080
and that way they can encrypt really

663
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,320
fast your hard drives and backups

664
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,100
probably as well again this was about

665
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,159
this apt group the impact the impact was

666
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,440
huge temporary food shelters around the

667
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,080
East Coast for five days more than 70

668
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,779
percent of the filling stations were ran

669
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,000
out of gas in areas from North Carolina

670
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,460
to South Virginia this was a really

671
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,100
critical damage really critical damage

672
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,220
by then was actually involved and and

673
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,820
mentioned that in the news responding to

674
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,340
uh uh to Finns and talking about that

675
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,980
out there

676
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,120
one of the main things was happening is

677
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,960
because uh because the new Cyber attack

678
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,880
was happening there was Panic buying

679
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,880
more that led to more shortage and also

680
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,159
the gas prices were highest in ease

681
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,860
three dollars per gallon

682
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,740
so as I told you remember that the FBI

683
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,440
was was also involved in that so it was

684
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,600
supervised by the FBI and they were

685
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,020
threatening them that uh

686
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,120
we will we will take care of that we

687
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,059
will manage and we take care of that and

688
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,100
actually that's kind of thing that

689
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,080
happened a couple of days after the

690
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,419
payout and stuff like that the whole

691
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,840
service went down uh some money was

692
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,279
stolen and and one day after uh Biden

693
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,960
Biden was spreading them and stuff like

694
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,419
that so

695
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,500
Dark Side probably did a messed up thing

696
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,640
messing up with the with the US

697
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,559
government

698
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,059
so the aftermath of all this story is

699
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,059
that on the 7th of June look it took it

700
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,919
took much it took time it took a lot of

701
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,700
time do we have a 60 63 Bitcoins which

702
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,100
are which at that point in time was only

703
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,460
two million dollars worth uh the FBI

704
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,260
assumed to uh to uh seem to be estimated

705
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,220
as uh uh this this amount and they

706
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,299
acquired uh the private keys for the

707
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,220
wallets we don't know how but this is

708
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,380
what assumed to happen in they also this

709
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,960
is upon their servers again we don't

710
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,840
know how and who also there was uh one

711
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,460
day after a congressional hearing about

712
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,980
this attack and it's really really

713
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,440
amazing to see how less knowledgeable

714
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,840
how much we don't have enough knowledge

715
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,240
about this kind of threats about this

716
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,460
kind of scenarios we can see that the

717
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,679
the CEO of pipeline is saying out there

718
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,740
in the news we didn't know at the time

719
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,179
at the time of like we didn't know the

720
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,520
answer uh whether the pipeline was

721
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,679
actually changed is it's not just about

722
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,140
the ransomware what if someone was

723
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,659
chained changing the pipeline broke the

724
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,440
pipeline make the pipeline uh uh

725
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,539
properties uh different so I don't know

726
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,580
causing explosions to cover going to

727
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,580
feel the the stuff you know so they were

728
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,679
really didn't know about that but they

729
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,260
were assuming that the daxa group won't

730
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,620
do that that's well that's a nice

731
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,440
assumption but they really really lack

732
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,899
many many data they really like this

733
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,080
cyber security level uh that would help

734
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,240
them to understand the threats

735
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,220
so the lessons learned from that and

736
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,020
from the Congressional hearing and all

737
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,020
of that as do the basic clearer news

738
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,520
password enable two-factor

739
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,940
authentication do backups and add-on

740
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,520
also data guarding and much much more

741
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,860
and the second thing is that attacks

742
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,940
will happen

743
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,220
it's all good attacks will happen

744
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,440
prepare your emergency plans prepare

745
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,320
your incident response plans mitigate

746
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
the blast radius minimize these

747
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,240
platforms this blast radius don't expect

748
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,580
the tax won't happen don't expect the

749
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,820
100 it's it's not viable

750
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,000
also look over Legacy entries the legacy

751
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,159
is is the king sometimes for the

752
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,740
attackers Legacy systems old user old

753
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,500
apps fix them update them remove all

754
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,640
users

755
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
and get the best out of each expert the

756
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,100
cyber security is so diverse raise your

757
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,140
skill level learn from many experts

758
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,480
every expert in each field learn from

759
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
them from different ways and of course

760
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,700
after increase your cyber security

761
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,340
maturity level understand how to

762
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,500
configure security tools and understand

763
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,019
how to educate your personnel and

764
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,179
increase

765
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,399
the skilled Personnel inside your system

766
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,820
that work in here with you

767
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,418
um

768
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,119
with that in mind

769
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,679
this concludes my last story about that

770
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,080
I want to thank you all for uh for being

771
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,839
there for being with me here today uh

772
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,339
this is my my Twitter you can follow on

773
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,139
my LinkedIn as well

774
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,659
um also I have so many credits and I'm

775
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,440
uh uh to to this giant responsible for

776
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,080
uh uh so many public reports and Tech

777
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,899
reports uh concluded and and being used

778
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,480
over this talk

779
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,199
um so uh with that in mind uh that's it

780
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,098
thank you very much

781
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,699
foreign

782
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,199
thank you Barrack for that uh

783
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,060
interesting

784
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,740
presentation with some very serious

785
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,959
topics any questions from the audience

786
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,500
yeah sure

787
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,619
so um I saw the Lessons Learned slide

788
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,540
and if you could just go back to that

789
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,280
yeah I have a question related to this

790
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,240
so why isn't there a line called budget

791
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,300
here because what we understand from all

792
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,220
of these you know incidents is that

793
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,339
neither of those three we could argue

794
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,380
about the electricity sector but not the

795
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,839
hospital nor Colonial had cyber security

796
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,240
budget fitting there

797
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,680
operating profile so have you had any

798
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,720
ideas you know how it changed the cyber

799
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,599
security budget being hacked and coming

800
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,140
in NSA to you know yeah

801
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,720
um so so it's really interesting problem

802
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,700
and again I think I can discuss about

803
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,099
this problem forever I think that one of

804
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,020
the main challenges nowadays in in sub

805
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,320
security areas is that uh how to really

806
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,420
divide your budget corresponding to the

807
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,400
attacks being out there and how to

808
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,599
maximize your budget I don't have a wise

809
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,060
solution for that I can tell you you

810
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,680
know that the cliche I think that

811
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,180
increase the cyber security budget but

812
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,099
it doesn't work like that I think that

813
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,320
uh you need to involve it with with

814
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,119
plans with uh probably uh someone that

815
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,579
leads the efforts that is knowledgeable

816
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,460
and can measure the impact measure the

817
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,099
effectiveness of cyber security efforts

818
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,920
done in your systems corresponds to the

819
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,380
threats and the attacks that you want to

820
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,680
mitigate so for example if I'm uh I

821
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,780
don't know I have this website only for

822
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,900
PR purposes maybe I don't put so much

823
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,200
effort into uh there using this is the

824
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,500
Holy Grail of uh securing this this

825
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
website prioritize prioritize your

826
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,839
things when you prioritize you can make

827
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,540
the most of your security budgets but

828
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,280
it's really really hard thing to do it's

829
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,619
not an easy one for sure

830
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,280
thank you

831
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,480
anybody else

832
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,400
uh do you have any knowledge or idea
