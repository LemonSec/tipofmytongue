25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,040
program uh welcome everyone thanks for

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,220
so who am I I'm Joseph I'm fuzzyboxes on

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,680
Twitter Discord wherever you can find me

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,780
if you want to ask questions I'm not

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,960
sure whether we have time to answer all

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,759
your questions right now

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,680
uh about me

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
I've been working in Security in almost

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,400
nine years now uh 10 plus years in Tech

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,500
overall I started out as a developer I

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,619
did some penetration testing uh didn't

41
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,380
really enjoy that I much prefer working

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,500
with code and software overall

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,899
then then I pivoted into leading

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,520
Security Programs

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,500
especially around application security

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,020
so application security is one of my pet

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,179
peeves especially when it comes to

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,000
security tooling security Champion

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
programs security architecture that type

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,440
of stuff

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,140
one of my hobbies is uh Gathering

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,180
certifications so you can see that I

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,220
have oscp ccsk mapped scppt I'm an ISO

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,500
20K

55
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,420
27k1 lead auditor and I'm probably the

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,660
only person in Hungary who renews their

57
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,720
certified ethical hacker certification

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,099
so

59
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,160
yeah

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,560
uh one more fun fact about me I worked

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,080
for LogMeIn who is now called go to I've

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,819
worked for true motion who is now called

63
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,580
CMT I've worked for project Consulting

64
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,000
who are now called TR consulate who have

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
been acquired by 4ig so if you have a

66
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,220
startup and you want to get acquired

67
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,800
then you should hire me and I'll

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720
guarantee you that you will get acquired

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,940
really soon

70
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,000
so I would like to warn everyone that

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,340
this is not a not a technical talk at

72
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,459
all which is uh kind of surprising at

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,220
activity you can expect some sarcasm

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,800
bathroom or really opinionated

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,220
exaggerations about the industry uh

76
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,500
I've been working for quite some time

77
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,900
and I have seen some really really bad

78
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
examples

79
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,400
uh I still have some ndas so I'm not

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,700
gonna point fingers but uh yeah I've

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
seen some

82
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,360
what I'm going to talk about is the

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,700
first 90 days of taking over a security

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,860
program

85
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,319
blessings learned how we usually run

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,060
Security Programs what are common

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,239
pitfalls in implementation talking to

88
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,379
people how to mess up some things and

89
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,540
hopefully

90
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,260
one of my major points will be how not

91
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,519
to be the most hated person at your job

92
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,620
when I started coming to activity it was

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,379
all about developers suck developers

94
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,159
don't know anything that type of talk I

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,339
I really try to change and devote that

96
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,320
type of behavior because it's really

97
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,860
toxic and yeah developers make really

98
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,620
awesome stuff that I wouldn't be able to

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,120
do if I were a developer so

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,460
yeah

101
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,460
why we are talking about this uh this is

102
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,919
uh really important so starting a

103
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,500
security program can be hard I know that

104
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,139
there are plenty of resources like uh

105
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,820
Frameworks

106
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,139
uh regulations compliance blah blah blah

107
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,500
but uh you don't really have like a path

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,900
that you can follow and uh at the end of

109
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,020
the day thank you you will be secure uh

110
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,759
you will know what to do just present

111
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,180
this to the board and you'll be happy uh

112
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,580
what we need to do as an industry is

113
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,560
come together and share more about

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,800
what's going on what usually happens is

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
that if you're if you have been in the

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,540
industry for some time now you will have

117
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,699
friends you will have friends who worked

118
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,919
with you you will have friends who left

119
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
the company joined other companies they

120
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,780
are now working there they see what they

121
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,100
mess up

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,320
they don't share that

123
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
unless you have like some private chat

124
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
rooms where you discuss all the breaches

125
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,759
and whatnot so the Lessons Learned are

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,840
usually not shared among people

127
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,780
and uh one more thing is that I really

128
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,419
see in the industry is that security

129
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,820
often doesn't understand business there

130
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,960
is like a disconnect between security

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,539
practitioners managers csos that type of

132
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,639
stuff so

133
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,220
I think we what we need to do is just

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,440
try to understand try to help the

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
business instead of blocking all the

136
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
time

137
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
so when it comes to security teams this

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
is usually how they see us we are like

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,340
uh not the most uh

140
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,800
most friendly people in an organization

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,039
just uh the same as lawyers same as

142
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,620
compliance folks

143
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,259
yes

144
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,520
and uh

145
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,500
we need to make sure that we are doing

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,419
the right things that people can talk to

147
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,080
us they can come forward approach us and

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,500
tell us what's going on uh when it comes

149
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,360
to the security of their products of

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,180
their infrastructure or just business

151
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,580
processes overall

152
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,680
so what we usually do as a security team

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,380
is we Monitor and protect company assets

154
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,139
that can be

155
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,419
documents that can be applications that

156
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,900
can be infrastructure that can be

157
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,180
any type of information basically

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,360
and how we view it is usually we create

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
security policies documentation we build

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,620
up security tooling we make sure that we

161
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,380
manage the technical risk

162
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,139
and we try to evangelize security

163
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,539
Downstream and Upstream so we try to

164
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,440
make

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,419
security

166
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,520
easy to achieve

167
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,500
kind of like not threatening uh way of

168
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
doing things so if you're constantly

169
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,020
harassing people to implement stuff then

170
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,440
you're probably your approach is wrong

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,960
uh

172
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,840
also we need to support sales and growth

173
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,960
so that's one way to change the whole

174
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,560
security as a cost center to security

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,620
who enables sales and makes deals happen

176
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,460
so that's one thing where you can really

177
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,220
really change the whole image of

178
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,680
security because uh you know sales is

179
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,479
celebrated all the time they close a big

180
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,360
deal and once they close a big deal you

181
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
want to be there you want to be the

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,539
person who sells uh shouts out that okay

183
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,940
security made this happen they wrote a

184
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,880
really cool white paper they filled out

185
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,620
that security questionnaire took some

186
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,800
time with that so you want to be there

187
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,940
you

188
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,520
you should be the person who they run to

189
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,800
when they have a problem and uh even if

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
you're super busy just make sure let

191
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,779
them know that what's a realistic

192
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,120
deadline and when they can talk to you

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,360
and prioritize sales and growth first

194
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,339
so why are usually security people hired

195
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,000
uh

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,300
so one thing is uh your predecessor left

197
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,760
the company this can be a good thing or

198
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,320
a bad thing

199
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,899
it's usually not a good thing otherwise

200
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,940
they wouldn't have left the company so

201
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,300
they either don't pay enough or they

202
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,240
chose a different path or your manager

203
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,959
will be a not so friendly person

204
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,300
company suddenly cares about your about

205
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,940
the security of your data

206
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,459
let's be honest that's not not happening

207
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,019
anytime soon

208
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,300
risk to became too big to handle without

209
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,279
security controls this is totally

210
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,440
realistic I have seen it in person where

211
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,779
you know just the sheer amount of data

212
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,000
the sensitivity of the data become too

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,220
big to handle without security Engineers

214
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,260
so they hire a security team

215
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,480
company needs compliance for business

216
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,399
this is also a relatively

217
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,519
straightforward thing for uh B2B startup

218
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,040
and uh the other reason is that someone

219
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
messed up big time so think about hacks

220
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,580
breaches internal conflicts incidents

221
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,640
that type of scenarios

222
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
and we have a

223
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,839
couple of typical companies that I would

224
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,240
like to introduce here

225
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,360
so startups you can expect to be the

226
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,420
first Security hire here uh

227
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,700
uh they go fast they break things they

228
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,220
spare no expense except on security

229
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,580
uh product Comes First Security like

230
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,100
whenever

231
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,500
Your Role will be basically just trying

232
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,720
not to get in the way and save

233
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,760
themselves from shooting themselves in

234
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,880
the foot uh just try to prevent

235
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,300
architectural mistakes things that can

236
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,060
become problematic later on

237
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,519
and your basic your job will basically

238
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,860
be spending catch up with devs and POS

239
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,640
because they will push like uh three

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,740
release every day without any kind of

241
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,560
security oversight your your job will be

242
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,160
to just try to shift left and uh try to

243
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,260
get as close to the source so that you

244
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,140
can catch the nasty things uh maybe

245
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,880
build some security tooling into the

246
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,800
pipeline so that you can catch it first

247
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,700
establish uh the right standards while

248
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,680
the company is still small and you don't

249
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
have to fight with 500 Developers

250
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,100
with mid-sized companies they might

251
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,500
already have some kind of security

252
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
control exacting po exact existing

253
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,079
program they have smaller budgets than

254
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,260
big companies but the scope can be just

255
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,560
as big you can expect a lot of Legacy

256
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,320
here uh

257
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
it can be nasty

258
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,100
and one thing that I would like to point

259
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,920
out here is that uh really a lot of

260
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,380
things depend on the con on the company

261
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,500
culture and the management support so

262
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,339
if you take one takeaway from this talk

263
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,180
is that you you should never go anywhere

264
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,399
where you don't have the right culture

265
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,620
or the right support because you will

266
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,660
end up quitting in

267
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,060
three months so

268
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,700
yeah just keep an eye on that

269
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,120
and big companies yeah they should

270
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,740
already have some kind of security

271
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,040
program but uh

272
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,860
you won't enjoy this uh things takes

273
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,500
ages to fix because of bureaucracy

274
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,420
there's more Legacy stuff than you could

275
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,200
ever imagine like uh yeah

276
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,779
yeah there is a lot of ktlo product that

277
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,180
uh companies sell and they don't really

278
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,459
do any kind of security there it's just

279
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,079
a show off

280
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,740
uh one problem is that responsibilities

281
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,899
might be quite unclear you know as the

282
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,959
size of the organization grows uh assets

283
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,360
creep up left and right I have not

284
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,940
worked in security well not the security

285
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,980
I have not worked in a company that

286
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,380
didn't reorganize itself every two years

287
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,300
so

288
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
all of these changes basically boil down

289
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,839
to responsibility shifts where things

290
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,500
disappear they don't end up on the radar

291
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,200
of any kind of team so you will end up

292
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,600
with things that don't really belong

293
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,720
anywhere and you have to catch up with

294
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,480
uh find the owner and maybe the owner

295
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
left the company three years ago or just

296
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,620
uh

297
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,660
switch roles and will ignore all of your

298
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,740
emails

299
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,519
and you will also expect to find a lot

300
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,040
of skeletons in the closet so

301
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,899
that is uh something that you should

302
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,639
expect

303
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,899
and

304
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,300
so let's say that you have been hired as

305
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,660
a security engineer or security decision

306
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,240
maker now you got them get delay of the

307
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,740
land understand how the organization

308
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,420
works

309
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,180
so one thing that you should do this

310
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,980
should be the first thing that you do is

311
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,399
uh prepare for the worst I have a friend

312
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,760
who didn't even finish his onboarding

313
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,500
and he has been pulled into a security

314
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,100
incident on his second week

315
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,839
yeah so you need to make sure that you

316
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,760
know who to escalate to who to turn to

317
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,060
if problems arises uh because you might

318
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,399
be pulled into a security incidence on

319
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,139
your first day I

320
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,380
I know a CIO who who ended up getting

321
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,779
pulled into a really severe security

322
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,680
incident on his first day like imagine

323
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,959
joining a company and then they

324
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,940
announced that okay we have been

325
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,860
breached please come into the boardroom

326
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,320
and let's discuss what should we do you

327
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,139
don't know anybody

328
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,700
you don't want to be in that situation

329
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,500
one thing that you should do when you're

330
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,720
there is that understand why you have

331
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,720
been hired because your priorities

332
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,820
should be aligned with business uh

333
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,320
this basically boils down to a single

334
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,760
fact that uh companies don't hire people

335
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,420
to build a dream security team like

336
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,480
that's that's our dream

337
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,220
uh business doesn't work that way they

338
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,959
they need to

339
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,579
uh

340
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,500
they need

341
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,740
you to provide some kind of value so and

342
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,420
they expect something if they don't

343
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,480
expect something then that's uh that's

344
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,940
really shady and you you should be

345
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,480
really careful with that I

346
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,240
I once tried to

347
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,760
join a company and they didn't tell me

348
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,120
what the expectations were so

349
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,980
at the end of the interview we decided

350
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,880
that this wasn't a good fit and uh I was

351
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,680
really anxious because they didn't say

352
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,839
why they needed a security engineer so

353
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,720
they were like yeah I don't know it's

354
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
it's we think it's the right time to

355
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,639
have a security engineer and then they

356
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,060
ended up hiring a friend of my friend so

357
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,120
I heard back a couple months later and

358
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,060
uh basically they hired like an

359
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,339
entry-level guy a couple of years of

360
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,040
experience and they expected him to roll

361
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,579
out a compliance program build up like a

362
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,380
really big security program because they

363
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,820
wanted to break into business to

364
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,800
business from business to Consumer so

365
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,920
you might be ready for that but you know

366
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
you should know it before you join a

367
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,899
company or expect that some things might

368
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,339
change

369
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,500
so one thing that you should expect is

370
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,899
that when you join a company and you are

371
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,300
the First Security hire or everyone is

372
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,579
just like uh less experienced than you

373
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,980
that you will be the smartest person in

374
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,440
the room when it comes to security this

375
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
might not be true so you might have a

376
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,940
boss that who has been a CSO for I don't

377
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,660
know

378
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,139
13 years and uh

379
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,139
but that's not his job so you were hired

380
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,940
to make security decisions you were

381
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,339
hired to build up a security program so

382
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,220
he will probably he or she will probably

383
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,139
not

384
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,079
try to push you too much if yes then you

385
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,720
should look for a different job because

386
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,640
we are honestly not hired to be

387
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,939
micromanaged unless that's your thing

388
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,500
so

389
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,179
the other thing is that you should

390
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,859
always do your homework don't accept

391
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,079
anything at face value I have seen a lot

392
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,359
of companies communicate oh we really

393
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,540
good at security we have a static code

394
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,640
analysis rolled out on all of the

395
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,459
products we have

396
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,460
100 security Champions and when you go

397
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,160
in look at that yeah half of them left

398
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,100
the company like three months ago and

399
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,380
the other half doesn't even belong to

400
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,200
that same team and yeah we have static

401
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,780
code analysis but no one looks at it and

402
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,960
uh most of the build builds just ignore

403
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,860
that steps and they fail so that doesn't

404
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,400
even matter I mean it good it looks good

405
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
on compliance but if they ask for an

406
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
Evidence then you're pretty much messed

407
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,080
up

408
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,419
and one thing that you should do is ask

409
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,679
for a 30 60 90 day plan so just that you

410
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,780
can know what they expect from you and

411
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,179
what are the outcomes of you being there

412
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,480
because uh you don't want to be fired

413
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,340
because of some miscommunication between

414
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,860
you and your manager that uh okay you

415
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,660
didn't provide

416
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,059
any of the outcomes that we expected you

417
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,419
to do like you didn't even give me an

418
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,120
expectation so what the hell

419
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,100
so once you're basically at the company

420
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,220
you should become familiar with all of

421
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,320
the written resources that are there so

422
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,299
you need to understand the organization

423
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,000
structure the culture the products the

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
services what I usually like to do is

425
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,340
when I join a new company is that I go

426
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,340
in I read all the wiki Pages all the

427
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,640
documentation all of the policies I dig

428
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,500
deep in slack I search for security

429
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,260
search for security incident search for

430
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,020
search for breach uh you know just

431
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,960
common type of security related keywords

432
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
and I try to read everything so and this

433
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,820
has

434
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,520
you know this has happened so many times

435
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,100
that uh they try to explain this

436
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,380
something and I already know it and I

437
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,940
already know that what they are trying

438
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,299
to explain it to me is not even going

439
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,820
that way because the real world is so

440
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,080
much different

441
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,500
and uh the other really awesome thing is

442
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,520
jira so jira has like a lot of history

443
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,679
you can see the history of the product

444
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,900
that you can see all of the security

445
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
bugs all the vulnerabilities and

446
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
people who work there they forget about

447
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,620
it so when you bring up some

448
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,480
three-year-old gr tickets that have a

449
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,700
critical security bug and you show it to

450
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,140
them like okay what's happened to this

451
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,480
and they're like

452
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,539
they don't know and uh

453
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,760
that's that's a really easy way to get

454
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,919
the lay of the land and understand

455
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,600
basically the threat transcript that

456
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,760
comes to a company

457
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,780
and uh a really good thing to do is to

458
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,520
make friends understand their pain

459
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,799
points like uh

460
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,200
some people just want to to be listened

461
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,260
to like they will tell you about all the

462
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,240
problems that they faced with security

463
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,460
and uh

464
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,160
you should understand their level of

465
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,620
influence so you want you want to keep

466
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,200
them uh so they're basically your

467
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
customers and you want to keep them

468
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,940
happy especially your powerful customers

469
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,760
because uh they can make or break your

470
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,780
career at that particular company so

471
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,940
if somebody comes to you that they need

472
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,179
I don't know uh resources to do X Y and

473
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,179
Z and uh uh

474
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,580
you say that okay but I don't have the

475
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,160
budget to do that and I know that this

476
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
is really important for you so if you

477
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
could help me out talk to finance that

478
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,700
you need this and just give them a

479
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,299
little nudge then uh that can be a

480
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,419
really powerful uh

481
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,380
uh tool in your among your assets and uh

482
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,140
one thing is don't be afraid of asking

483
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,320
questions don't join a company that

484
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,640
discourages asking questions questions

485
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,919
are good

486
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,320
I have seen a lot of companies where

487
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,780
there will

488
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,539
uh like you try to understand one thing

489
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,960
the documentation said uh something in

490
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,200
real life it was implemented differently

491
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,240
and in code it was also implemented

492
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,840
differently because some Upstream

493
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,640
dependency overrode that thing and it

494
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,220
didn't even work that way so

495
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,280
if you ask questions then you will get a

496
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,220
better picture of what's going on in

497
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,960
real life

498
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,880
and uh

499
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,940
compliance matters it's uh it's

500
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,100
something that we tend to ignore if

501
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,860
you've come from practical a practical

502
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,900
security background where yeah

503
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,059
compliance will it's just checking

504
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,299
actual spreadsheets and whatever but uh

505
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,720
those things matter uh contractual and

506
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
legal obligations can make or break a

507
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,659
company this is a Baseline

508
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,080
once Business Signs something they they

509
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,380
should treat it as the bare minimum and

510
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,419
uh

511
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:28,559
non-compliance can lead to a lot of pain

512
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,400
later on so it can lead to penalties

513
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,960
damages that you have to pay to for the

514
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,580
government it can lead to Lost

515
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,480
businesses and a lot of discomfort from

516
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,220
your end if you need to gather evidence

517
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,220
that you know doesn't exist or you only

518
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,960
have the

519
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,600
the exact opposite as an evidenced like

520
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,120
uh yeah we are running uh static

521
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,940
security testing and uh the static

522
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,039
security testing tool have been offline

523
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,559
for six months like

524
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,080
how can you forge that evidence that's

525
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,360
uh that's a question

526
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,840
and uh you need to do it early like uh

527
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,000
this is like a really powerful tool in

528
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,860
Your Arsenal where if you come up with a

529
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,559
requirement Matrix uh you document what

530
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,480
you need what you need to be compliant

531
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,419
with like okay we need to run static

532
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,520
security testing you need to run Dynamic

533
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,679
security testing we need to do software

534
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,380
composition analysis we have like X Y

535
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,120
and Z as a

536
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,900
as a patch management criteria then you

537
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,080
can Define that and just build your

538
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,140
policies upon that and if they ask why

539
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,940
did you do this because we need to be

540
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,000
compliant with X Y and Z so

541
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
and you signed a deal you agreed to it

542
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
so it's not like

543
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,559
something that's flexible we must do it

544
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,020
and when you start mapping out gaps so

545
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,780
you come to a company you understand the

546
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,340
compliance requirements you understand

547
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,760
like how the company is built up now you

548
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,260
want to understand what are the security

549
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,360
gaps because you were hired to fix them

550
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,039
or just

551
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,260
get that technical risk to an acceptable

552
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,960
level and there are a couple of common

553
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,260
methods to find uh problems uh you will

554
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,480
probably do a mixture of these

555
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
uh because there is

556
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,280
you don't you can't really at least

557
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,500
realistically expect to find everything

558
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,140
with only using one of these techniques

559
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,260
uh security Frameworks is one common way

560
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,880
to do it so just look at the iso 27k1

561
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,740
technical controls or the nist framework

562
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,299
or

563
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,960
just a security maturity model and a

564
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
startup map okay we are at this point

565
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,440
our peers are at this point so we should

566
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,480
probably get somewhere in the same

567
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,740
ballpark

568
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,900
and uh

569
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,419
if if they do any kind of like

570
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,100
compliance program then they should have

571
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,980
a risk register and it should be updated

572
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,620
you will find some gems there that

573
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,840
haven't been addressed in a really long

574
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,140
time and uh that's always the good idea

575
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,179
to take a look at that and try to build

576
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,020
upon that and you can say it's like a

577
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,659
it's a big thing that okay this has been

578
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,940
on the risk register for for consecutive

579
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,059
years and uh I fixed it during my first

580
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,940
three months there so that's

581
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,620
that's a quick win

582
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,880
third party audits can be expensive and

583
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,080
uh

584
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,440
uh I'm not a huge fan of them because uh

585
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,900
you can't realistically

586
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,740
expect someone to come in uh spend two

587
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,000
days there

588
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,360
uh people are gonna lie like uh that's a

589
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,460
really common thing that I have seen uh

590
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,320
is that people like to Auditors all the

591
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
time because they

592
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,940
kind of expect them to be lied to

593
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,980
threat modeling is is really good but

594
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,159
you need to approach it the right way

595
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,919
people don't like to be blamed they

596
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,200
don't like to be the person who

597
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,000
introduced that bug they don't like to

598
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,820
be the person who needs to fix that bug

599
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,279
so when I try to do threat modeling I

600
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
always try to approach it like

601
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,480
okay guys we are just mapping out the

602
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,240
security problems you don't need to fix

603
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,220
it if business doesn't want you to fix

604
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,620
it we're not going to point fingers okay

605
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,840
you introduce this box so you need to

606
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,400
fix it I I just try to gather as much uh

607
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
amount of information as I can and

608
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,799
basically synthesize it to some kind of

609
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,700
actionable plan and uh security tooling

610
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
can also be helpful here if you're

611
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
running WordPress just run a VP scan on

612
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,240
your corporate website and expect to

613
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,179
find unhappiness there and sadness

614
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,299
and uh this can take quite some time if

615
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,880
you're doing a throw a pro which like uh

616
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,100
you're doing a lot of these activities

617
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,340
then you will see that this can take

618
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,980
from a couple of days to couple of

619
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,380
months even and you will not find

620
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,260
anything that's for sure

621
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,080
and once you have that mapped out you

622
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,500
need to put together an action plan and

623
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,840
uh one thing that you will never have is

624
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,080
enough resources so you need to focus on

625
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,720
things that are either high risk they

626
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,179
amplify your impact or are easy or cheap

627
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,179
to fix so high risk means that if you

628
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,980
don't do this the company will get

629
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,419
breached in

630
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,360
a month a year a decade whatever it's a

631
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,480
high risk item critical risk item so you

632
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,220
need to do it right away

633
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,919
amplify your impact in this case means

634
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,679
that if you do that thing in your list

635
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,919
then you will have more time to do other

636
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,679
things so it frees up your time you can

637
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,059
do

638
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,179
more activities that are helpful in the

639
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,779
long-term Road and is it cheap to fix is

640
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,539
that those tasks that are like

641
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,700
relatively painless you can do it in a

642
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,400
couple of hours and uh

643
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,740
basically look good so that's like

644
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,200
fixing the Cypher suits and DS

645
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,760
configuration of your company website

646
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,279
one thing that basically eats up all of

647
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,000
your time is recurring tasks so every

648
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,539
security team has ktlo work and these

649
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,120
small things basically eat up all of

650
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,580
your time and limit the

651
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,860
amount of meaningful work that you can

652
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,140
put out so

653
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,240
you need to make sure that there isn't

654
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,380
too much time that you like put on your

655
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,860
backlog and uh otherwise you will be

656
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,799
doing constant firefighting and you

657
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,539
won't be able to do anything meaningful

658
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,760
that you were hired too

659
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,679
but a really good way for me is to

660
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,900
delegate things to other teams like uh

661
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,380
if they expect you to patch your patch

662
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,539
the company assets as a security team

663
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,220
then

664
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,240
I would run from that company like other

665
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,740
people know the infrastructure much

666
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,720
better that's their primary focus so

667
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,760
they should be patching that

668
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,159
uh unless uh

669
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,080
unless you're that type of organization

670
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,120
where the security Engineers are also

671
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,779
coders and unicorns and whatever but uh

672
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,940
good luck hiring people to that team

673
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,059
it's uh it's really hard we try that and

674
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,799
uh Outsourcing so if you do

675
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,240
vulnerability management as an

676
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,240
outsourced service that can also take

677
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,299
some pain away from your shoulders and

678
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,159
you can automate some of the things just

679
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,799
be careful that automation doesn't come

680
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,600
cheap so

681
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,179
if you try to automate something then

682
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,760
you need to keep that up and running so

683
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,059
if you build a tool that tool will have

684
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,220
vulnerabilities you will need to fix

685
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,100
those vulnerabilities the service will

686
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,740
go down you need to restore that service

687
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,820
if compliance expects you to

688
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,940
have evidence for monthly scans and your

689
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,179
service goes down regularly then

690
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,880
then you will quickly end up just

691
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,740
maintaining that for a really really

692
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,260
long time so

693
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,779
yeah rolling out and maintaining this

694
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,140
can be an operational Nightmare and uh

695
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,480
hosting your tools is just one thing

696
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,600
that I personally don't really prefer we

697
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,580
have tried it with

698
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,919
blender managed tools with open source

699
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,860
tools like uh they don't

700
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,380
really work unless you're that type of

701
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,240
team or you're

702
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,480
like put into a team that does this as a

703
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,240
living like it's your primary focus

704
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,620
so

705
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,559
when it comes to tooling my advice is

706
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,820
just

707
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,159
only implement it if it saves you time

708
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,039
and resources so you don't need to

709
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,500
implement a vulnerability scanner if it

710
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,299
doesn't spark Joy

711
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,159
you

712
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,140
you should only Implement something is

713
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,960
it improves Security in a meaningful way

714
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,140
or is required for sales and compliance

715
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,779
and but then again you should look at

716
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,220
tools that are

717
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,500
painless to keep running

718
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,440
and one thing that's really easy is to

719
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,840
repurpose and piggyback non-security

720
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
tools so if you have like a CI CD

721
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,200
pipeline you have linters Cloud

722
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
platforms mdms those have security tools

723
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,860
baked in and what you should do is just

724
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,179
ask

725
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,580
permissions to access the security part

726
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,120
of that tool and use it for security

727
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,500
it's a

728
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,620
it's also really good because people are

729
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,360
know how to use it and it's less

730
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,399
friction than introducing something you

731
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,539
like uh asking people to log into a new

732
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,659
service and expecting them to okay now

733
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,360
you have to click on that button in Octa

734
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,419
after every comment look at what the

735
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,200
outcome of that security scan is and uh

736
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
and take action based on that that

737
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,399
introduces friction and people don't

738
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,460
like friction

739
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,740
and uh something that you should also do

740
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,240
is uh reporting so reporting serves two

741
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,679
purposes one is to just show to

742
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,440
management that okay we have been uh

743
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,100
this secure so far and we are right here

744
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
or right here and uh what we

745
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,480
expect to do to improve that score uh or

746
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,120
say that okay we have been keeping this

747
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,279
and we have been decreasing the overall

748
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,840
risk level uh by like minus x amount of

749
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,179
vulnerabilities per month and if you

750
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,340
expect us to

751
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,440
to look at that other product that you

752
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,299
are trying to bring into the company we

753
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,880
need to hire I don't know another person

754
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,640
to do that job

755
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,140
you can also recognize common

756
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,380
outstanding issues and patterns like

757
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,640
if

758
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,580
if you see that the company really

759
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,679
struggles with cross-site scripting then

760
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,779
you should probably do a training on

761
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,000
cross-site scripting and make sure that

762
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,260
everyone attends that training it's a

763
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,559
this can be used to just fix like uh

764
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,899
patterns like toxic patterns that occur

765
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,320
within the company and they just show

766
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,559
you a really easy way to improve your

767
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,880
foundations

768
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,960
and uh I've fallen into this trap before

769
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,299
always try to make reports that are

770
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,000
useful both to you and to leadership

771
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,640
because otherwise you will be doing

772
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,760
twice as much work which uh which

773
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,860
basically leads to pain and friction

774
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,659
again

775
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,080
so creating an action plan so

776
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,119
what you need to do is understand your

777
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,239
assets your risk and your security

778
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,339
maturity and build something upon that

779
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,520
like a short-term action plan and why

780
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,619
you need to understand your assets is

781
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,839
that are those are the things that you

782
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,540
are trying to protect uh

783
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,359
you know the risks like what's the risk

784
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,159
of breaching that very important asset

785
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,800
in your company and you understand your

786
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,440
security maturity like how do we protect

787
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,560
that very valuable asset and uh you need

788
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,500
to come up with short plans like uh

789
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,440
okay we are we have really really crappy

790
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,260
firewalls on our uh I don't know

791
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,320
production data set data center then

792
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,379
your first thing would be to fix that

793
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,200
throw big things that like take ages to

794
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,359
implement on the backlog and try to

795
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,180
break it down to smaller pieces because

796
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,200
that way you can uh break it down and

797
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,740
make it more friendly for your

798
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,320
for your overall workload

799
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,420
and you don't get lost in the details

800
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,740
because you've already breaking it down

801
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,980
to smaller chunks and uh you should

802
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,660
build up the foundations before doing

803
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,640
any of the flashy stuff so you don't

804
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,800
need the blockchain you don't need the

805
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,920
AI you don't need all those fancy Cloud

806
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,520
thingies if you haven't implemented a

807
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,940
centralized identity the solution so if

808
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,339
you're if your people are still logging

809
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,859
in with short credentials then you

810
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,220
really don't need to do a lot to make

811
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,640
that more secure

812
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,960
and one more thing is that you don't

813
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,820
need to be afraid to revisit and change

814
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,460
this later it's perfectly fine to change

815
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,980
that action plan later on

816
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,280
and uh just to summarize some of this

817
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,099
stuff here is the 30 60 90 day example

818
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,320
so that if you

819
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,300
happen to

820
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,339
join a company and you don't have a 30

821
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,280
60 90 day then you will know like you

822
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,079
will have some kind of boilerplate that

823
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,160
you can look at

824
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,560
so it's just basically the same thing

825
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
that we have went through like

826
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,579
understanding the company uh meeting key

827
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,579
stakeholders and teams understanding the

828
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,440
Regulatory and contractual obligations

829
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,380
mapping at gaps uh coming up with

830
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,359
short-term goals and long-term

831
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,740
improvements

832
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,579
and we are almost there so keep on

833
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,540
so how to become that that security guy

834
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,920
if you have read the Phoenix project

835
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,560
John desiso is like really get an

836
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,200
example of that guy that we don't want

837
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,339
to become

838
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,040
so I have seen this Behavior a lot with

839
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,859
the csos so don't throw your weight

840
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,619
around this is really like uh this metro

841
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,500
Alpha toxic masculine where you

842
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,540
come to a company and you know like the

843
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,420
the the the this which need to fix that

844
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,160
yesterday why weren't you doing this

845
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,940
don't do that that's awkward and creepy

846
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,200
uh don't think that you're smarter than

847
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,900
everyone this is really really that God

848
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,000
complex where you think that just

849
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,980
because you are an expert on your field

850
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,300
which which is relatively uh Niche field

851
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,160
then you are smarter than everyone else

852
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,460
you're not uh other people are smarter

853
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,880
than you that's just a fact don't try to

854
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,200
change everything on your first day

855
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,119
that's uh that's also something that

856
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,460
I've seen where somebody like new CSO

857
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,680
comes on board and they need to revamp

858
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,359
everything they need to flip everything

859
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,420
they need to okay from tomorrow we are

860
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,640
using qualius instead of nests tomorrow

861
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,480
we are going to use I don't know and uh

862
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,339
just because they are familiar with that

863
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,140
they understand that they fear the new

864
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,980
things

865
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,160
and uh don't be a security absolute test

866
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,740
so please don't do that we are we are

867
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,260
not here to make perfect security we're

868
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,960
here to make good enough security that

869
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,060
that is appropriate to the level of risk

870
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,619
that we are facing

871
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,220
and uh don't buy that super expensive AI

872
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,980
blockchain crap like uh

873
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,140
it's like train your people up do that

874
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,720
instead of like wasting money on uh on a

875
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,079
lot of fund or

876
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,540
recommended materials so

877
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,460
here are some things that I really

878
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,320
enjoyed during my career the Phoenix

879
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,680
project that's classic agile application

880
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,260
security is even if you are not into

881
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,359
application security but if you work

882
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,640
with software companies this is a must

883
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,400
read startup secure is like a really

884
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,380
really high level this is not even for

885
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,480
security people it's for business people

886
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,680
but it kind of gets you at the same

887
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,079
mentality that others will expect you to

888
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,900
communicate with and uh

889
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,079
the defense in that slash the CSO series

890
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,180
podcast is another really great podcast

891
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,880
that uh you should listen to they just

892
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,700
invite csos from other big companies

893
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,579
like LinkedIn those type of stuff and

894
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,900
they talk about really interesting

895
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,220
security uh topics and uh if you become

896
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,020
a security decision maker then project

897
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,320
management will be a must so knowing how

898
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,240
to manage projects uh what are the

899
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,400
common pitfalls of security projects or

900
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,520
other projects uh the Google project

901
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,800
management course I found it really

902
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,079
really good it's a practical course

903
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,500
which is uh which is like mind-blowing

904
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,220
like uh it's kind of like the oscp for

905
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,619
project management

906
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,480
uh you will need to draft up project

907
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,180
management documents and this is a much

908
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,800
better way of learning this really

909
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,740
boring subject so

910
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,440
yeah I can recommend it a lot

911
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,119
and like

912
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,680
a really short summarization of

913
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,079
everything like be humble

914
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,880
security is only one part of the

915
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,540
business you need to be like in sync

916
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,920
with all of the other parts of the

917
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,020
business try to make friends instead of

918
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,599
enemies do a few things do them well

919
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,579
enough don't try to do everything

920
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:14,880
perfectly don't boil the ocean don't do

921
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,460
like really really flashy stuff that you

922
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,980
will not finish because it will bite you

923
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,000
in the ass later on and uh

924
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,980
I think we ran out of time

925
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,240
and uh so no questions and uh if you

926
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,119
have any just uh there's a Discord and

927
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,599
you can and just ask questions there uh

928
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,500
so thank you very much

929
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:52,289
