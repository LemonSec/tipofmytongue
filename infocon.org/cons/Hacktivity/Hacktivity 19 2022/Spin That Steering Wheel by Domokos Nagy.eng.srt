1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,520
okay ladies and gentlemen thanks for

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,200
your patience as you can see there was

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,379
some uh setup to be done but so without

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,440
further Ado I'll pass you over to

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,540
Dominic thank you

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,440
so welcome everyone

7
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,400
so uh let me worry about this session so

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,439
when I work from home

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,580
I

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,580
I have some challenges who who has a

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,640
kids at home raise your hand

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,779
it

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,840
you okay so you know uh when I'm talking

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,340
about challenges you know what does it

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,360
mean so I have two daughters and we have

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,640
unexpected amount of

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,820
um slots stuffing slots at home like

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,600
this

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,579
and

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,760
um one time um when I was working on

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,980
this project

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,460
I was working on this project

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,860
she's the most clever one

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,039
and realized that uh

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,040
uh I when I was working on the on on

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,040
this wheel and I found all of the

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,680
challenges and passed through them uh

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,780
finally I can spin that wheel and it was

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,860
really appealing to her and uh I could

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,680
not detach from from this project

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,280
anymore so we have slots and

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,040
she really excited to spin that wheel

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,080
so let's get started

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
um

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,500
I

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,780
would like to start with the schedule

37
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,500
for today here is the when we go through

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,420
the automotive Basics just to understand

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,200
our attacking steps uh we'll have a

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
really preparated attack tree and we go

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,079
through and so the first half uh we're

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,280
gonna see more theoretical and more

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,860
basic uh stuff and then we go through

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,579
the consoles and best script to see how

45
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,299
we can spin that wheel

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,119
so my name is Domi I've been

47
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,800
working in the field of cyber security

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,000
for almost uh 15 years and I have

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,340
offensive and defensive background both

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,680
in vulnerability assessment to

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,340
investigations and

52
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,000
I I have a master's degree and there was

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,459
a time I collected certifications

54
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,300
um

55
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,540
and a year ago I challenged myself to

56
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,060
change the I to to to leave the ID

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,140
security and go to product and uh I

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,680
found a good good way that I joined to

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,480
the prologue cyber security at the same

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,560
group

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
and

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,879
I like the idea how to extend the extent

63
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,980
activity with Automotive as well and I'm

64
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,780
a happy owner model 6 so I personally

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,300
involved in this stuff

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,620
and here's our disclaimer so the

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,840
following demo was prepared for training

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,360
and educational purposes and do not try

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,340
to use any information for hacking

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,440
against cars and car components

71
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,760
text

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,620
so

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180
let's get started

74
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,280
um we all know that safety is more than

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,300
important in modern vehicles but

76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,159
the question is for today that what

77
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,680
about cyber security so

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,220
um

79
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,800
do you remember Charlie Miller and

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,920
Christopher car hackings in the past 10

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,379
years they had awesome researches and it

82
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,360
was eye-opener not just to me for the

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
whole industry so

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
um

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,739
maybe nine years ago Charlie was here

86
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,260
presenting their their findings and it

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,440
was awesome for me so today I will take

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
a closer look how how to hack into the

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,220
car comp how to hack into the car

90
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,799
component and um

91
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,319
we were using back books approach so we

92
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,900
don't know anything about our Target I

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,299
don't know I don't care I will just want

94
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,000
to reveal brute force and finally find

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
my way to to use

96
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,360
for my purposes and there are some

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,939
challenges on the road so we we need to

98
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,858
understand how we can talk with this

99
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,339
device how we can have access find

100
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,680
weaknesses in security implementation

101
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,400
and if we find them we try to invoke

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,979
routines implemented routines and one

103
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,180
may spin that wheel so let's get started

104
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,040
let me introduce our attack to read

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
sorry this is the first step so we need

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
to understand that we are if we are in

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
the car we have some kind of network and

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
there are ecu's electronic control units

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,080
and physically connected together and uh

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,540
I have a hint so campus is used most in

111
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,460
the car snow days so we will focus on

112
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,638
can

113
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,340
uh what what is it so it's a control RL

114
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,639
Network and

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,419
as we have this it's it's something like

116
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,280
similar in the it word that we have

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,560
ethernet and Erp so it's in the in

118
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,380
physical data link layer and

119
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,660
the problem to me

120
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,419
that's another girl that the dozens of

121
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,020
vcu's hanging on the same bus which is a

122
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,219
analyst nightmare because they're

123
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,220
they are so talkative and we have many

124
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,380
uh communication so if you have a

125
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,419
capture we will see some kind of mess

126
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,639
and we need to understand what kind of

127
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
IDs we need to focus on so if we have a

128
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,740
special Target we need to find it and

129
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,139
maybe

130
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,320
you can find uh your Target by its ID

131
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,600
I don't know which one is which one

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,080
and after the ID usually in a can you

133
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,199
have the data we will cover it later but

134
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,419
it's inside

135
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,639
so are we going to do let's disconnect

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
the target device amount from the car

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,199
maybe it's it's a hard part so maybe

138
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,139
it's easier just to detach from the

139
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,320
canvas and connect your tester tool for

140
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,320
that on that point and test set up your

141
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,139
test environment wake it up find the

142
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,740
signals and try to communicate with it

143
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,060
sounds easy but ah

144
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,979
just one more question

145
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,380
maybe on what communication protocols so

146
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,539
we have UDS unified diagnostic services

147
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,740
the

148
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,740
fits in all modern cars and with a car

149
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,840
diagnostic tool you can talk in this

150
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,259
language with car issues

151
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,680
so as it's a communication protocol uh

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,979
it's it's it's on the top of can in an

153
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,800
application layer we have eods

154
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
and

155
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,020
in practice

156
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,460
as a tester with client via VCU as a

157
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,919
server which offers access to its

158
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,440
services and if you know what kind of

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,340
service is there and how to uh

160
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,620
request some kind of things based on the

161
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,840
service and its parameters you will get

162
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,940
back some kind of service specific

163
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,580
information as a response in case of

164
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,099
positive response it can be different by

165
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,620
service service in case of negative

166
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,340
responsive fixed message format at the

167
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,979
beginning beginning with the 7f and then

168
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,960
the rejected service ID and then the

169
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,120
negative Response Code

170
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,560
so let me peel this layer

171
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,319
so it means then this is the cause of

172
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,400
rejection what it what you can get so um

173
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,699
let me rephrase it so if I in an I.T

174
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,880
World in as a web server with the web

175
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,340
server do you provide access logs to

176
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,180
your clients no uh and what was the

177
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,800
problem here if you request the service

178
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,680
you will get back a non-existing service

179
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,419
you would have back a service not

180
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,000
supported so isn't that something that

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,919
should be hidden from the bad guys yes

182
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,539
but this is the word of UDS so

183
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,940
let me show a small message flow that we

184
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,479
are usually when startup a device in the

185
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
default session by default there are a

186
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
few Services you need to extend your

187
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,599
session to an undefault one to get more

188
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,820
services to work on on the device and

189
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,399
this is you this can be done by session

190
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,860
control so

191
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,680
requesting a session to extend your

192
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
session to level three you will get back

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,300
response and

194
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,459
this is if it's a positive response your

195
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,339
section section extended to to this one

196
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,640
to level three in case of uh negative

197
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,060
response uh it will start with the 7f

198
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,880
the rejected service ID which is 10 and

199
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,980
the negative Response Code in this case

200
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,380
is 12 sat function not supported what

201
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,660
does it mean that my session control

202
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,800
service 10 and

203
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,279
the requested level is five the liquid

204
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,899
state session was five and it was

205
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,279
rejected because that function not

206
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,140
supported but the sub function was the

207
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,500
survey the session so that session level

208
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,380
session five is not existing in this

209
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,459
system so thanks to the NRC we can we

210
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,000
can we can we can figure out uh what is

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,860
available in a device

212
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,040
so uh here is our setup

213
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,720
we have a two-word steering it's a it's

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,779
preparated with a custom firmware it's

215
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,260
totally uh different than what you can

216
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,480
see on the road it's prepared for

217
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,260
security weakness and it's it's nothing

218
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,540
else you can find this and it's

219
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,360
connected in a canvas with a Canon

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,080
interface to its laptop by USB and this

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,860
USB added to my virtual machine which

222
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,680
has Linux open source tools can utils uh

223
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,160
what you what you want to do

224
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,339
is just to start to communicate with it

225
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,920
so the first thing uh

226
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,040
we usually see in a unknown Network just

227
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
to

228
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,200
listen so we we started with the

229
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,420
Staffing on the bus with Ken Smith and

230
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,839
well we could see periodical messages so

231
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,700
it's it's always changing the red red

232
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,760
bite red bytes are always changing it

233
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
can it's I don't know it's some kind of

234
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,320
information a current value of something

235
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
the direction the angle the torque or

236
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
anything

237
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
but this is these Droids are not the

238
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,980
ones you are looking for because you uh

239
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,200
need to find a server which will respond

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,100
to you

241
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,779
so

242
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,600
we need to identify what which can ideas

243
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,240
can be used for our

244
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,260
uh attacking scenario and by session

245
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,959
request which we know that you can

246
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,480
request

247
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,820
on this issue a normal session request

248
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,220
to the default session and you will you

249
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,560
can wait for the positive responses and

250
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,380
if you enumerate all of the canadies you

251
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,180
will find your

252
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,700
once so I numerating all of the canadies

253
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,519
with can send the tool

254
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,300
uh here are our responses I use the

255
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,779
search

256
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,920
okay so I use the filter for only the

257
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,920
positive responses for the default

258
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
section change and

259
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,899
there are only two ones so we have can

260
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,660
IDs and we can where we can send

261
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,560
messages and then we know uh which can

262
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,079
ID will get back some response that's

263
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,880
good that was the first step that we

264
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,540
need so we have canadis and no we know

265
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,860
that we need to go for the UDS messages

266
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,140
the first thing what kind of sessions

267
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,300
are in the system available

268
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,519
so there is a manual request for

269
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,180
1001 for the default and maybe I tried

270
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,300
an unknown one 21 and see the

271
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,839
differences between the the results

272
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,640
for the default on we get a positive

273
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,880
response in the green so in the green

274
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,980
box and

275
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,260
we have negative response for an unknown

276
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,519
service session 21.

277
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
as we know the the negative Response

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,820
Code NRC 12 with sub function not

279
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,740
supported which means that session is

280
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,040
not available

281
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,620
[Music]

282
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,939
find boot services

283
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,740
going to an extended session

284
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,700
okay

285
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,680
which kind of services are available we

286
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,700
know that the session session control is

287
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,880
is there so uh on the second line it's

288
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,839
uh

289
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,800
requesting it's a session control

290
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,220
request without parameters so it's it's

291
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,579
a it's a easy priced

292
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,180
in our case and for the 10 we get back a

293
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,220
negative Response Code which means that

294
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,420
sub function it's so

295
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,700
so this means that the service is

296
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,040
available but it's some function was

297
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,820
wrong

298
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,060
however in other case for example

299
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,820
service 9 we get back NRC 11 server is

300
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,260
not supported what does it mean I'm

301
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,660
interested in the supported services

302
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,760
so filter out the non-supported services

303
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,639
thanks to the NRC it can be done

304
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,420
enumerating all of the services

305
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,199
we get back

306
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,959
not supported ones so we found Services

307
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,720
what kind of services are there

308
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
we have obviously we have diagnostic

309
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,240
session control which can be used to

310
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,000
extend our session to a diagnostic

311
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,160
session to unlock additional diagnostic

312
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,380
functions we have issue that may be good

313
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,600
sometimes to go back to the Baseline and

314
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,420
start everything anything from the

315
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,440
beginning

316
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,620
we have security access to requesting

317
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,019
seats and then sending calculated keys

318
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,899
and get get outed authenticated get

319
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,560
access to something which is

320
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,100
secured

321
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,800
and we have routine control maybe that's

322
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,660
the most interesting one because rooting

323
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,540
control can call routines implemented

324
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,019
routines and one maybe May uh spin that

325
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,240
wheel so that's that's a good one and

326
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,480
that's the present it helps to uh keep

327
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,139
alive your session so where we are we

328
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,639
know the services and we start to to

329
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,980
hunt down hunt down the most interesting

330
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,620
one the rooting control

331
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,220
um rooting control flow shows you that

332
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,600
um

333
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,820
it's a service service it has a service

334
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,060
ID 31 and the start routing zero one so

335
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,660
with the with this you can request to

336
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,000
start a routine that's all what we need

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,260
so

338
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,320
we just try to start a routine and if

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,839
the routine is there and it's everything

340
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,240
is okay we get back a positive response

341
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,000
service ID Plus 40.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
uh the rooting start uh byte is there

343
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,660
and here is the routing ID is two bytes

344
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,220
so

345
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,079
if you want to start this routine and

346
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,300
you will get back a positive response it

347
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,100
means that this routine is executed

348
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,480
that's good

349
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,420
in the other case if you get back some

350
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,860
negative responses you need to

351
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,940
understand

352
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,880
that oh this was the rejected service ID

353
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
and what is the negative Response Code

354
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,339
and i52 energy again we see that

355
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,800
security access denied that's the point

356
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,260
that we need to understand that okay

357
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,100
there are routines but you need to

358
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,380
elevate your security level to go there

359
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,980
and run that routine so this routine ID

360
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,339
at one a b does not performed

361
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,079
in this case because it's a negative

362
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,579
response

363
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,779
so get it real we started by manually

364
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,800
the first few rooted IDs

365
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,680
3101 and from 0 to 3.

366
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,199
and we get back always the same negative

367
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,320
Response Code 31 which is a bit sad that

368
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,060
it's out of range

369
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,579
in this case it means that that routine

370
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,559
ID 0 1 2 3 was not there so

371
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,079
the only thing we need to we need to do

372
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,599
at first just filter out this kind of

373
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,579
negative responses Maybe

374
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,000
one has different response

375
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,859
and the numerating all of the routines

376
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,400
is by Script you will you will get back

377
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,500
in the green only one different

378
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,960
routine ID and different with the

379
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,080
different response negative response

380
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,380
as we've seen before

381
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,940
NRC searches three so it's accurately

382
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,340
access denied so where we are we know

383
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,860
that there is a routine

384
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,559
which can be called but we need to have

385
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,780
kind of access kind of security

386
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,200
authentication to run it

387
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,940
that's where we are and

388
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,860
here is our attacking tree so we need to

389
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,400
step back and go to security access we

390
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,559
need to bypass somehow this security

391
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,600
find some weaknesses so I promise this

392
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,919
is the last message flow we need to

393
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,500
cover and is it so this is also useful

394
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,919
for our Capture the Flag game so uh

395
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,620
service ID is 27 security level from one

396
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,860
and I did it by two

397
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,320
you can authenticate yourself requesting

398
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,100
in this first case there is a security

399
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,740
assessment request for seed for the

400
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,200
level one and you if in case of positive

401
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,419
response so the security level is there

402
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,460
you get like a positive response with

403
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,679
the seed it can be one by two by three

404
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,280
bytes more and maybe it's good to

405
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,860
understand that if it's small you can

406
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,600
build up your dictionary and try to

407
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,780
guess all of the possible keys for a

408
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,179
seed and you will build up to your

409
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,220
dictionary and you will find a key

410
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,919
maybe it's useful later however if you

411
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,140
get back a seed in normal way you need

412
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,640
to understand you need to know the

413
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,039
security algorithm in the sacred key and

414
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,380
then you can send back a key

415
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,700
uh

416
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,240
based on this process you need to

417
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,059
add one more

418
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,580
one more to the security level and then

419
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,480
you can send your calculated key if it's

420
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,240
good you will get back the service ID

421
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,760
plus 40 and

422
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,799
and uh

423
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,020
and it's something so it's it's okay

424
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,120
it's positive it's authenticated so you

425
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
are in the security level one

426
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,960
and based on this process you need to

427
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,580
understand that you need a security

428
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,980
access level and then a good key that's

429
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,080
all what you need what we need but we

430
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,600
don't know about too too much about the

431
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,740
security

432
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,460
uh process in this device so what we

433
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,960
need to do figure out everything about

434
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,640
this service

435
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,260
so going to the live demo part we will

436
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,840
try to find out available security

437
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,380
levels we will analyze the seats maybe

438
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,520
it's random or not the length and what's

439
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,860
the behavior of the wizard we will do

440
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,500
the same on the security Keys calculated

441
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,799
case but maybe we need to Brute Force

442
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,520
the key space and as we have

443
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,580
Google and the standards we know all of

444
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,580
the nrcs so everything can go wrong but

445
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,100
NRC will help

446
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,418
this is the demo time

447
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,299
and

448
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,500
I need just a minute to change my

449
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
desktop

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,039
okay

451
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,660
and for doing that

452
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,799
I would like to

453
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,440
use

454
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,679
the webcam just to see if if you are

455
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,059
seated in the in the back to see what's

456
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,900
going on because we are focusing how to

457
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,820
bypass the security then how we can call

458
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,740
the routine to spin that wheel so that's

459
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,559
why we need to see this cam

460
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,320
to focus our

461
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,539
Target

462
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,620
what's the password

463
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,820
so this is the live demo part everything

464
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,799
can go wrong

465
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,740
Okay so

466
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,559
so we have a Canon interface uh what's

467
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,918
the password

468
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,520
should be up and running yes it's there

469
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,780
and

470
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,220
uh okay maybe I need to

471
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,440
zoom in

472
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,039
okay so we will use the right part of

473
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,159
the screen to see the responses the

474
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,260
messages that sent out and the response

475
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,440
is from the ECU you use the left part to

476
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,039
send some

477
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
uh cam messages and I have prepared

478
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,340
scripts so first we need to enumerate

479
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,200
all these security levels one May

480
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,780
respond differently

481
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,720
going through this process

482
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,480
okay let me stop it so at the first

483
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,980
as you see after the extended session

484
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,500
we'll get always back a negative

485
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,820
response

486
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,460
responses and one is different so we

487
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,679
have a positive response what is the

488
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,799
positive response 67 which is the

489
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,880
positive response for 27 and we have

490
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,539
it's requested security level it's 0b

491
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,580
maybe we can use a different filter just

492
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,720
to

493
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,220
get closer

494
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,700
this word

495
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,960
and I will highlight this again

496
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,159
so going through all of the security

497
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,280
levels I'm I filtered out all of the

498
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,679
negative responses which we are not

499
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,380
interested and so

500
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,500
filtered only for those responses were

501
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,679
very positive responses and check the

502
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,840
line before what was the request so we

503
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,159
know that we requested a level B and we

504
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,659
get back a positive response so we know

505
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,520
what is the security level

506
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,658
one checked

507
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,620
the next one we need to request seeds on

508
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,760
this level

509
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,840
to see what kind of seeding is there

510
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,460
I don't know so we

511
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,179
we check all

512
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,100
and I'm filtering only for the responses

513
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm not interested but I sent out

514
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,059
because I know what is there

515
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,659
so as we see there there are always a

516
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,940
get back seats so 67 0b and 0b and then

517
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,500
seats

518
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,220
it's kind of Randomness so it's not good

519
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,220
for a quick win we can use it to build

520
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,260
up our dictionary we'll skip that way

521
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,500
and we try to see what's the behavior of

522
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,940
the reset

523
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,840
so

524
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,960
in the next example we sent we will send

525
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,740
out a easy Wizard and see what is

526
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,440
changed so from now we have an extended

527
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,620
session and get backseat oops and the in

528
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,240
the positive responses the seats are

529
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,020
always the same 40 to 40 to 42

530
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,539
nine or ten times so in the first 10

531
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,179
seconds let me stop it in the first 10

532
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,520
seconds uh we will have fixed it what

533
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,140
does it mean that if we have a challenge

534
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,500
let's fix it we can answer

535
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,440
a fix we we should find a fixed answer

536
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,320
which is which one we need to send back

537
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,440
to the server to authenticate it so

538
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,780
we can Brute Force the key space

539
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,020
and one will help

540
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,600
that's going deeper six seven

541
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,140
and brute forcing the

542
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,460
keys

543
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,039
so after is it okay let me stop it I see

544
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,539
so what's the problem uh at first

545
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,240
here is our seed and then what what

546
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,580
happened we get back always a negative

547
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,500
response and what is the negative

548
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,480
Response Code 35 then 24 okay I have a

549
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,340
help

550
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,460
from Google or anywhere else

551
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,340
35 means that invalid key so I I had a

552
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,620
key attempt tried a key and it was

553
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,659
installed that's good and after that

554
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,740
what happened I get back

555
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,720
24s which means request sequence error

556
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,000
because

557
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,740
I will show you what what's the problem

558
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,279
so the problem is that after reset in

559
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,000
the extended session we we have a CD

560
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,299
request and then in a loop just sending

561
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,580
keys and this is

562
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,860
not good it's not in the process so it's

563
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,960
you need to request to see then after a

564
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,919
key

565
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,059
and do it again time by time so going to

566
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,980
the next one and

567
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,100
let me check

568
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,799
all right

569
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,860
okay going through

570
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,240
let me stop it so in the next example uh

571
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,799
we get back a seed and then invalid key

572
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,460
and then a seed and then invalid key so

573
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,980
we try the key and we get back I got the

574
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,840
response it's not there it's not there

575
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
it's not there going through

576
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,659
uh let me use let me just filter out

577
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,380
this noise

578
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,940
and

579
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,820
what is the noise so

580
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm more interested everything else but

581
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,240
not the seed

582
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,600
that's good oh that's not good again

583
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,640
I didn't say that it's easy

584
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,640
it's easy easy weaknesses but we have

585
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,580
some challenges so the next step is that

586
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,500
after one two three four five attempts

587
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,179
we get back

588
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,360
negative response 36 and then a 37 what

589
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,840
does it mean

590
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,659
exceeded number of attempts and then

591
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,419
require time delay not expired Brute

592
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,520
Force protection is there it's not good

593
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,460
it's not an easy win we need to work

594
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,360
with this so what we did we requested we

595
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,419
sent out five different Keys got back

596
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,940
invalid Keys negative response and then

597
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,659
band so we need to work in a loop and

598
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,380
visit the ECU time by time that's why we

599
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,940
have scripted and brought different

600
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,539
script

601
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,539
okay

602
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:52,860
so this one is the next one

603
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,620
so what we're gonna do

604
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,000
is just to see

605
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,840
so we're gonna do that we are interested

606
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,620
all of the can IDs started with seven

607
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,440
and filtering for the positive responses

608
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,120
because we know the security access

609
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,659
protocol sending sending a request for

610
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,419
seed then get back positive response

611
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,299
with the seed and then sending a key

612
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,399
with secret level plus one so if you

613
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,159
have a zero B level we need to go to

614
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,760
we are interested in the zero C for in a

615
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,039
positive response and in this case

616
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,260
uh there is a small small chance that we

617
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,520
will find a good key

618
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,840
it can time consuming if we started from

619
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,659
one byte from zero to effect and go

620
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,539
further and we need to reset Time by

621
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,399
time so

622
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,179
depends on the key space and the

623
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,580
delays

624
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,179
it can be a minute or more yeah okay so

625
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,700
let me stop it so you need to understand

626
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,600
that the key space is only one

627
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,020
byte and the C C is always here is just

628
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,080
one byte so here is the whole process we

629
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,440
have a security seed request for zero B

630
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,419
we get a positive response with the seed

631
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:45,720
then we have a calculated key we brute

632
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,880
forced all of them but this one is the

633
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,580
only one who had a positive response so

634
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,320
we have a positive response for the zero

635
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,899
C it means that we are authenticated to

636
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,100
the level B

637
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,899
so um

638
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:01,020
I think we bypass the security so we we

639
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,659
need to rerun the routine and

640
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,640
it should be there

641
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,840
okay

642
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,559
let me

643
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,539
so

644
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,640
um let me warn you that the routing will

645
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,880
be executed I'm really expected that

646
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,419
something gonna

647
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,460
happen

648
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,480
so

649
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
see everything let's start the dump

650
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,520
let's start the routine so what we're

651
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,559
gonna do authenticate it to the security

652
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,679
level and call back the routine which we

653
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,140
know what is the routine ID sending this

654
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,399
out

655
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,539
and

656
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,539
yes a negative response again

657
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,720
sorry guys this is the way when we

658
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,539
authenticated to the will be we have a

659
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,640
positive response with level C and then

660
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,620
we started the routine but what what

661
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,200
went wrong NRC

662
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,220
I need to check it

663
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,399
13 incorrect message length so we call

664
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,779
the routine

665
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,140
and you need to understand that

666
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,880
here

667
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,320
is the length of the cam message and

668
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,399
and with four it means that I use the

669
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,860
routine control started the routine with

670
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,080
the routine ID in two bytes and without

671
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,520
parameters

672
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,020
so

673
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,240
the incorrect message length means that

674
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,059
we need to extend this length and give

675
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,379
and get some parameters

676
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,340
okay so here is my last script and after

677
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,200
an issue with it

678
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,740
uh we're gonna go to go to extended

679
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,580
session

680
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,039
access to security level B

681
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,440
requesting the seat sending a well known

682
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,120
key which we

683
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,980
which we had

684
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,380
and if it's granted

685
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,440
we call the routine uh in in the

686
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,720
previous uh step we call the routine

687
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,840
with four it was not good

688
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,439
so

689
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,240
we will call it with

690
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,440
length five and I placed FF in the at

691
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
that bite

692
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,120
and then I will call with length 2.

693
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,519
with length 6 which means that a

694
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,779
parameter has two on two bytes so I just

695
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,260
added FF on the last one and going

696
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,580
through I tried all of them so

697
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,220
let's have a chance

698
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,720
to do it

699
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,200
and

700
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,559
sorry I need to

701
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,279
reply

702
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,840
all right so last chance

703
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,739
that there is no way

704
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,540
no sound in the

705
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,199
in the jack

706
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,399
okay do we have a Zone

707
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:26,899
in Jack no okay you can skip this

708
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,599
so I'm really excited to spin that wheel

709
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,919
slot is there

710
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,980
is there

711
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,520
is there

712
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,399
three

713
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,399
thanks

714
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,760
okay

715
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,080
okay let's finish this previous up we

716
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,640
have five minutes I hope

717
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,579
so as we have two parameters I

718
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,740
understand uh which is what so one is

719
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,500
for direction oh sorry it's been wrong

720
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,099
so uh I just skipped some steps so one

721
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,960
parameter is for the direction and one

722
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,599
parameter is for the speed so

723
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,400
spinner to you

724
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,260
slowly like that

725
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,640
it's

726
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,720
okay and going to the presentation

727
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,319
oops

728
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,760
just meanwhile

729
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,119
meanwhile I found oh

730
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,960
slot even

731
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,560
and here we are

732
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,900
so after this have some demo time uh

733
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,700
going back so we understand that we have

734
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,040
routine and security access denied we

735
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,260
need to understand that there's a lack

736
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,500
of entropy so in the first few seconds

737
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,020
we have no random just a fixed seed it

738
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,940
means that no entropy and the small key

739
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,740
space small key small seed Smoky

740
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,880
and a weak Brute Force protection

741
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,760
because we could drive five keys

742
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,060
each time uh means that we went through

743
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,339
all of all of the process and security

744
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,200
bypassed

745
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,280
so what we've seen is the lesbian

746
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,619
so some conclusions that

747
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,400
why UDS in all vehicles by default there

748
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,460
is no cyber security and

749
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,280
keeping in mind that uh

750
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,280
possible effects on safety you need to

751
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,079
require design and implement the layers

752
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,780
of it and

753
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,500
it can be weak it can be I don't know we

754
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,560
have seen many things in the past so

755
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,079
so what I would like to highlight here

756
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,900
is just we need to validate somehow we

757
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,040
need to test our our stuff and this is

758
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,520
all about this presentation and that's

759
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,400
all you need so you need a

760
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,500
testers who can spin that wheel

761
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,180
and thank you

762
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
[Applause]

763
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,420
uh maybe just one more thing that come

764
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,520
to our booth challenge yourself and get

765
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,359
to have some prizes

766
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,700
yeah based on this damage do the closing

767
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,460
time for the

768
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,400
teaching competition or challenge isn't

769
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,740
quite known yet the Bosch will close at

770
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,940
three o'clock

771
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,960

will be announced here for each of the

773
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,940
three challenges the the winners

774
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,500
announced and the prize is given

775
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,800
sometime after three this afternoon when

776
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,640
