1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
to get the ball rolling

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,560
I'll hand you over to

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,758
Zoltan balaj

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,760
good afternoon everyone and good morning

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,280
for the rest of you

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,980
so today I'm going to talk about web

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,440
free and scams

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,199
so I'm leading the vulnerability

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,560
research lab at Cujo AI I had a bunch of

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,539
different offensive research in the past

11
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,759
for example when I was playing with an

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,940
iot device I found a post authentication

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,399
exploit which I published because I

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,379
thought it's post authentication so it's

15
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,280
fine this research ended up in a boatnet

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,399
so practically code I wrote was running

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,760
on 600 000 different computers usually

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,620
could I write only runs on one computer

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,860
or it doesn't run at all so I was pretty

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,140
proud about this achievement

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,219
I also invented the idea of encrypted

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,180
exploit delivery and I'm in the program

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,200
Committee of the activity Conference

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
co-organizer of the hack actually meet

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,479
up and volunteer at iot Village

26
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,060
so um this is a two-hour presentation

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,580
compressed into

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,000
14 minutes not 25 so if I sign your

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,240
seatbelt uh why am I doing this research

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,340
I really love playing with new

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,119
technology and I really find blockchain

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,759
and they're free really interesting

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,040
uh as you can see there are a lot of

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,280
issues with this technology but I pretty

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
much believe in this one that by time it

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,119
will evolved into something really great

37
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,939
I also have a wife paper about this

38
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,100
presentation so if you are interested

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,280
just ping me and I can send you the

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,439
white paper link

41
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,720
all right so

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,299
I was mentioning the free and scams so

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,820
some people think that free is a scam

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,399
which I don't believe that this is the

45
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,300
case I will not discuss smart contract

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,640
issues because that's a totally

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
different topic

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
uh I will not give you any Financial

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,640
advice where you should invest your

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,379
money

51
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
I will not discuss crypto exchange hacks

52
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,620
and I will not discuss any type of scams

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,319
where cryptocurrencies only the money

54
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,319
what is used uh is a form of payment

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,260
so how do we get here

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,180
um clearly everyone knows that a lot of

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,480
people got rich from cryptocurrencies

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
and a lot of people want to get rich

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,440
from cryptocurrencies

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
uh when I first created these slides uh

61
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
there was a saying that the total market

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,739
capitalization is around 2 trillion US

63
00:02:58,739 --> 00:02:59,819
dollars

64
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,819
uh right now it's only one trillion but

65
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,280
still I think it's a significant amount

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,300
of money I have no idea uh what this

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,060
amount of money is I know it's a bit

68
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,760
more than my monthly salary so clearly

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,739
this is a lot of money

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,159
so uh as you will see during the

71
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,980
presentation this is a very new complex

72
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,739
technology with a really crappy user

73
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,879
interface

74
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
so the question is what could possibly

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
go wrong if you combine these facts

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
together

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,700
so let's say that we have a scammer and

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,580
he's shopping around for new scans what

79
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,470
should I do today

80
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,680
[Music]

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,519
should I send some romantic scans

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,080
shall I send some invoices from T-Mobile

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,299
or do I do some package delivery from

84
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,480
UPS

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,040
[Music]

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
or

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,000
let's use some very nice the free

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,599
related scan right this is what's new

89
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,360
hot right now for all the scammers they

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,860
really like this scenario

91
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,760
okay so let's discuss Bitcoin because

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,800
Bitcoin is the basis of all the

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
cryptocurrencies so it's very important

94
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,660
that everyone understands what is crypto

95
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,440
about and I have invited a free Grammy

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,380
Award winner blockchain expert to tell

97
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,180
you everything you have to know about

98
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,840
Bitcoin

99
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,680
a message from cash app and the CEO of

100
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
hot girl Enterprise Megan the stallion

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
wait it's the new digital currency

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
that's been getting a lot of hype

103
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,829
[Music]

104
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,180
Bitcoin is a new kind of money while the

105
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,500
cash in your wallet is issued and

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,900
regulated by governments Bitcoin is a

107
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,540
cryptocurrency like a wild stallion it

108
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,820
can't be controlled by anywhere that

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,160
means that no one person or organization

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,320
gets to decide how much of it is used

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,600
how much of it is in circulation or what

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,960
it's worth

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,039
okay so boom there's only a limited

114
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,520
amount of Bitcoin like gold silver or me

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,740
it's scarcity and security is what can

116
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,539
make Bitcoin valuable

117
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,940
every Bitcoin is unique and has its own

118
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,100
ID that is certified by a super secure

119
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,740
technology called the blockchain

120
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,900
you can't make a fake Bitcoin no matter

121
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,799
how hard you try

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
foreign

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,699
like gold or gas prices bitcoin's value

124
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,860
can go up and down as the demand changes

125
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,900
although there's some other Nitty Gritty

126
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,799
stuff that factors into

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,380
that means when people are selling the

128
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,000
price goes down

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,220
when lots of people are buying it

130
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,180
it comes back up

131
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,180
Bitcoin is not hard to get you just

132
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,919
gotta know how you can get it from

133
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,020
another person or from special markets

134
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,300
called cryptocurrency exchanges you can

135
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
also easily buy it on cash app starting

136
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,840
with as low as one dollar's worth

137
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,460
Bitcoin is an investment so you can lose

138
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,919
money the price can go up and down by

139
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,780
the hour but the more you educate

140
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,520
yourself on bitcoin the better equipped

141
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
your B to navigate those curves

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,020
that's all for now but with my knowledge

143
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,699
and your hustle you'll have your own

144
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,039
Empire in no time I'll see you at the

145
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,159
top

146
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,039
so the reason I really like this video

147
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,380
because it shows you that a lot of

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,020
people are into cryptocurrencies they

149
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,080
have no idea what it is

150
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,300
but also what I liked in this video that

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,880
uh definitely some lawyers who are

152
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,860
involved in this ad because I'm pretty

153
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,560
sure that whoever paid for this ad they

154
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,199
did not the original idea was not to

155
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,300
advertise that hey you can lose money on

156
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,300
bitcoin hey the price can go down so

157
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,759
this will assure the lawyers who added

158
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,500
these texts

159
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,639
and today I'm going to show you a lot of

160
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,639
different scamming techniques and in

161
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,360
order to see how much money a scammer

162
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,539
can make from these scams I introduced

163
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,660
the lamp o Meter because in the

164
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,479
cryptocurrency word you usually measure

165
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,099
your valve regarding how many

166
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,900
Lamborghinis you have

167
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,780
so the question from scamming is that

168
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,060
not whether you can make one Lambo but

169
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,160
how many

170
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,819
so let's start with Kim Kardashian pump

171
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,460
and dump case

172
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,520
she was into this crypto token called

173
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,580
ethereum Max and

174
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
um I think it was only this week that

175
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,880
Kim Kardashian was

176
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,919
sued and now she has to pay a penalty of

177
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,139
I don't know a lot of money because of

178
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,319
this advertisement but as far as I

179
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,020
remember she is not uh

180
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
she doesn't have to pay this money

181
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,620
because she did something wrong like

182
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,958
pumping up the price of this token but

183
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,000
because she forgot to pay the taxes

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,779
after she the money she get from the

185
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,600
people who are behind eat their own Max

186
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,899
so how this pump and dumps Keys Works uh

187
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,220
it's not a new thing you have seen this

188
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,240
also in the stock market or penny stocks

189
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,920
you just have to buy a lot from

190
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,839
something what is cheap and it has a low

191
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,839
volume advertise this as the next big

192
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,740
thing play pay a lot of celebrities to

193
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,740
have your advertisement sell on top

194
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,720
profit right

195
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,200
uh sometimes it's very rare but you can

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,480
even make some profit by shorting on the

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,279
top so that's very good

198
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,720
um but after a while I think these

199
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
celebrities are uh like no from real

200
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,220
um believe them anymore so you can make

201
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,360
some money with this but not that much

202
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,000
rockpool is really similar to pump and

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,080
dump but the main difference is that you

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,839
are the owner or the developer with this

205
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,360
whole thing and whether it's a

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,240
cryptocurrency or a token or nft or

207
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,660
whatever and because you control the

208
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,899
whole ecosystem from the start you can

209
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,720
do a lot of interesting things with this

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,860
and there's a very famous case of a rock

211
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,680
pool which was called the squid game

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,980
token you might remember this Korean

213
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,100
series squid game which was very popular

214
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,080
last year and some scammers were

215
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,300
benefiting from all the hype so they

216
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,420
created this squid game tokens it's

217
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,640
practically out of thin air like you

218
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,459
don't have to do anything to create one

219
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,920
gazillion of these tokens

220
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,700
then they hired it and when it was on

221
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,940
the top they thought everything and they

222
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,920
got a lot of money and what's really

223
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,260
interesting that there was a leak from a

224
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,779
ransomware group called The Conti group

225
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,720
and if you check their chats they

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,000
already knew about this rock pool before

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,540
it happened

228
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,279
so there is this very traditional

229
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,600
giveaway scam if you check Twitter there

230
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,180
are famous accounts especially accounts

231
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,880
who are interested in cryptocurrencies

232
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,899
and you can see a lot of lot of bots

233
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,800
replying to these Twitter feeds and they

234
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,779
say that hey someone is giving away

235
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,519
cryptocurrency

236
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,579
you just only have to send some

237
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,220
cryptocurrency beforehand and you will

238
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,380
get twice back

239
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,560
right so actually there are still people

240
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,399
who are falling for this kind of scams

241
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,500
yeah this happens

242
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,680
like uh in this particular case someone

243
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,940
got like almost free Bitcoin which is

244
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,620
kind of a lot of money if you think how

245
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,620
sophisticated this hack is and what's

246
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,140
interesting that sometimes even very

247
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,600
high profile Twitter accounts were

248
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,060
hacked like this is the official Target

249
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,120
Twitter account Target is like a really

250
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,600
big grocery store in the US God knows

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,540
how many followers so whenever there's a

252
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,480
scam message like this then for sure

253
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,339
there will be a lot of people who will

254
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,000
believe this

255
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,279
Advanced fee fraud I really like this

256
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,040
one because I also personally received

257
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,279
this cam so I was able to check it for

258
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,100
myself but some of these screenshots are

259
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,079
not mine but it's from a proof Point

260
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,339
research

261
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,339
so what you get in the beginning is an

262
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,880
email where there's a link a username

263
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,360
and a password and they are trying to

264
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
convince you that if you log in to this

265
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,320
website with these uh with this password

266
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
then you will be able to withdraw some

267
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,420
money from it

268
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,240
and when I tried it it was really

269
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
interesting because it was also asking

270
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,100
for my mobile phone number

271
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,720
in order to set up 2fa I stopped at this

272
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,279
point because I didn't want to bother

273
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,060
buying a new SIM card but if you log in

274
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,300
to the website you can see a fake

275
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,579
transaction history for this account

276
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,820
and if you want to withdraw then it

277
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,519
tells you that hey you just only have to

278
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,720
sound a little bit of Bitcoin uh to this

279
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,760
account before you can withdraw

280
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,320
everything

281
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,680
so clearly again this was a scam and uh

282
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,359
actually it was not that bad

283
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,779
so let's discuss nfts or non-fungible

284
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,300
tokens I'm pretty sure most of you know

285
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,240
what these are but let's just give a

286
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,019
quick introduction

287
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,459
um so

288
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,519
I'm active on Twitter and like four

289
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,480
years ago I bought this uh very ugly nft

290
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,339
I think I spent like one and a half

291
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,880
dollars in total uh buying this

292
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,519
particular nft and

293
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,320
um the reason I bought this because this

294
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,540
was the cheapest and probably the

295
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,620
ugliest one

296
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,579
and right now many people are bragging

297
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,980
with the runoff tees on Twitter that hey

298
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,920
I have this uh very expensive monkey

299
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,800
whatever and they are using it as their

300
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,380
profile picture so I thought I should

301
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,980
also brag how rich I am with this one

302
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,120
and a half dollar worth of crypto Kitty

303
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,540
and if you check on Twitter you can see

304
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,260
the address who created the smart

305
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,680
contract address who created this nft

306
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,820
and the nft token ID

307
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,000
this is how it looks like on

308
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
ether scan etherscan is practically a

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,240
very nice web-based UI for the at our

310
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,600
own blockchain and what you can see here

311
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,760
is that uh

312
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,560
this is my wallet address and this means

313
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,260
that I am the owner of this very nice

314
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,139
picture uh here you can see the contract

315
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,959
address and this is the token ID

316
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,779
so it's very important to see that most

317
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,660
of the time when people buy nfts what

318
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,660
they practically buy is an is a number

319
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,820
on a smart contract

320
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,300
right so that's basically what you buy

321
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,839
whenever you buy an nft

322
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,540
and some promises which are either

323
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,839
fulfilled or not if you check for

324
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,660
example the transaction logs on the

325
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,680
blockchain

326
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,860
here you can see that first this birth

327
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,420
function was called which created this

328
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,220
cryptokitty then the transfer function

329
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,820
was called and this means that now

330
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,839
I am the owner of this crypto Kitty

331
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,839
and um

332
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,180
nowadays most

333
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,019
um nfts they store all the properties of

334
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,500
your nft on a very interesting protocol

335
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,279
called ipfs I will not go into the

336
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,040
detail of those but um

337
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,699
I believe that using ipfs for nfts is a

338
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:33,420
good choice but back in the days when

339
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,760
cryptocurities were created they did not

340
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,240
use any kind of ipfs so what practically

341
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,779
happens is that when I bought this token

342
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:43,639
ID

343
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,519
I also received some bits and bytes

344
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,839
which describe how my nftv look like and

345
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,480
here's a smart contract code which

346
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
practically can decode these bits and

347
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,699
bytes and say

348
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:04,220
how my crypto Kitty really looks like

349
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,459
I didn't check the prices today but uh

350
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,699
ethereum is somewhere around

351
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,319
1700 US dollars

352
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,899
uh guess who bought this nft

353
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,339
I can help you uh it's a she and she

354
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,940
also created an nft about herself

355
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,100
and this was the magical design

356
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
so it was Paris Hilton and she bought it

357
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
for almost

358
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,000
1120 eater room she paid this amount of

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,940
money for this nft I believe back then

360
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,780
maybe a Tyrone was even more so yeah

361
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,940
it's a lot of money for this monkey

362
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,559
picture

363
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,760
who bought this one

364
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,440
no one

365
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,700
so this was Justin Bieber he paid 500 it

366
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,679
around for this

367
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
if you have a calculator you can try and

368
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,559
calculate this uh and convert it back to

369
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,418
Hungarian for it it's a lot

370
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,559
I really like this nft because it's not

371
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,780
a monkey picture

372
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,960
do you know who bought this one

373
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,220
see it was Snoop Dogg and he paid

374
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,700
2500 ethereum for this

375
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,340
picture and who's this last one

376
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,460
yes I mean I'm

377
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,960
okay so let's discuss about rock pools

378
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,799
in nfts there's this actress called Lana

379
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,100
Rhodes you might know her work from the

380
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,480
internet

381
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
and um

382
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,720
she did a rock pool on her nft project

383
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,780
and this is a screenshot where people

384
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,160
are complaining that they invested 4 000

385
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,760
US dollars in this nft project and now

386
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,360
because it's Rockwood it's practically

387
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,480
worthless and this someone has a

388
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
two-year-old son and not much money left

389
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
um clearly we don't know whether this

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,299
story is true or not but uh I'm pretty

391
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,760
sure that there are people out there on

392
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,500
the earth food made

393
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,900
such a good investments in the past

394
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,520
um this is the nft picture which this

395
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,700
someone bought for four thousand US

396
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,440
dollars

397
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,539
and this is again an interesting

398
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,840
screenshot because someone was begging

399
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,919
for a free nft from Lana and she replied

400
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,400
that your diapers are expensive she has

401
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
a kid so that's why she has to spend a

402
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
lot of money on diapers so she cannot

403
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,380
afford giving away these the flash

404
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,240
pictures for free

405
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,380
and the reason why Lana can get into

406
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,940
trouble because she promised uh phases

407
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,500
of this project

408
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,059
and she never fulfilled these phases

409
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,220
um because

410
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,340
she did The Rock pool very early in the

411
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,360
project and if you do this you can get

412
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,700
into jail because this means that you

413
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
promised something to your investors

414
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,480
and you never delivered that promise so

415
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,260
the investors can release you you so

416
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,539
they are like phase six is that uh

417
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,500
no yeah phase five is that uh 50 lucky

418
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,559
cryptosis owners will receive cryptosis

419
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,200
merch signed by Lana

420
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,960
so clearly there were a lot of people on

421
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,820
the internet who were interested in

422
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,639
getting hand signed Lana merch

423
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,460
social media accounts are hacked all the

424
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,460
time different platforms are hacked in

425
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,240
different ways uh for example this is

426
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,340
the live news with like 16

427
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,960
000

428
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,320
subscribers and it was hacked and it was

429
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,320
doing this Elon Musk giveaway scam which

430
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,320
we have seen recently

431
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,480
in the past uh very famous

432
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,700
nft Instagram accounts were also hacked

433
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,520
like this is the official board AP act

434
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,280
Club Instagram account where the

435
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,000
attackers changed the link to

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,740
yogalabs.land which was operated by the

437
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,840
scammers

438
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,780
um there are no official information on

439
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,020
how did this happen what we know is that

440
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,740
uh the uh board API Club developers are

441
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,840
stating that they had complex unique

442
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,220
passwords and 2fa so probably uh I

443
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,380
believe it was a social engineering

444
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,600
attack on Instagram where you can

445
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,840
repeatedly call the Instagram support

446
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,240
and without knowing anything about the

447
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,299
account you can find and convince a

448
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,419
support guy to reset the password on the

449
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,600
account

450
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,080
and um this one's uh also really

451
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,260
interesting because this is a Twitter

452
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,080
account from a company where I know

453
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,460
these people

454
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,400
and we had a discussion that again they

455
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,039
had no idea how their Twitter account

456
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,039
was hacked and it turns out what

457
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,100
happened they again had long complex

458
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,700
unique passwords and 2fa on the account

459
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,679
and it looks like what happened that

460
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
someone on the dark net was selling

461
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Twitter admin access for a lot of money

462
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
which means that if you have enough

463
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,360
money from your previous scams you can

464
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,820
just go on to the Twitter admin panel

465
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,900
and reset these accounts which will mean

466
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,059
that then you will be able to control

467
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,580
these accounts and post anything on

468
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,860
these accounts so that's bad

469
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,020
um

470
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,940
I'm going to show you an interesting

471
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,480
research which I did and it all started

472
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
on Discord I was monitoring the scam

473
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,059
alert channels on Discord and I found

474
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,260
this interesting scam

475
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,659
if you visit this website which was in

476
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,080
the scam you will be able to see this

477
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,900
where you can it promises you that

478
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,320
practically you can get new

479
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,580
nfts for free

480
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,980
and in the beginning you just have to

481
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,260
connect your account with your wallet

482
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,980
this is no malicious per se

483
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,340
but after connecting the JavaScript on

484
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,580
the website it will check your valid

485
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,640
address on openc and it will check what

486
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,520
type of nfts do you have and whether

487
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,580
they are worth stealing or not

488
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,000
so clearly this is something fishy here

489
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,860
and

490
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,700
if you already connected your wallet

491
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,640
then instead of the mint function which

492
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,720
you would expect from minting a new nft

493
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,059
the website suggests that you call this

494
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,100
safe transfer from function and if you

495
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,500
call this function on the contract this

496
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,679
is the contract of the nft what you have

497
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,080
so if you call this function it means

498
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,500
that you are giving away your nft to the

499
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,039
scammers which is this address

500
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,740
so clearly this is a user interface

501
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,460
issue because people are in a rush they

502
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,320
don't really understand what these

503
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,600
functions mean

504
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,940
so they are just clicking on confirm and

505
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,039
it doesn't really matter how many layers

506
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,580
of nice cryptography is behind your

507
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,980
wallets and nfts and blockchains and

508
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,200
whatever you are practically signing a

509
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,360
contract that hey I'm giving away my

510
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,880
nfts for free and I'm giving away this

511
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
for this camera

512
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,559
I checked the scammer website and I

513
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,960
found a GitHub page where this camera

514
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,520
was publishing his source code

515
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,059
and

516
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,120
um I found this uh interesting string

517
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,659
here which led me uh to hit the website

518
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,080
where he's selling it for real money

519
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,400
practically

520
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,320
and here you can see all the different

521
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,460
reviews this guy had like uh

522
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,600
very high quality thank you best trainer

523
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,039
got one azuki nft free day so clearly a

524
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,320
lot of scammers were already using this

525
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,799
framework

526
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,220
um these are all the different

527
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,880
functionalities the scammer

528
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,220
supported

529
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,980
and

530
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,860
yeah

531
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,860
the some parts of this scammer website

532
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,679
it was very heavily obfuscated

533
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,240
and guess how I was able to deal with

534
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
skate

535
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
these javascripts

536
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,299
what were my very lead hacking skills

537
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:53,760
I mentioned GitHub I went on GitHub and

538
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,620
checked all the previous comments and

539
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,020
one of the comics had a less obfuscated

540
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,600
version of this JavaScript and for from

541
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,400
there it was really easy to decrypt it

542
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,039
um and what was really interesting that

543
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,700
uh once I was able to access this

544
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,659
version I saw this code that if

545
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,840
something is more than 1.1

546
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,059
then

547
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,559
practically

548
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,299
send it to this and what really happens

549
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:29,580
that the original creator of this cam

550
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,940
framework added a back door

551
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,200
and the code checks if the nft is a

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,779
really expensive one and if it's a

553
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,779
really expensive one it will send these

554
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,900
nfts to the original creator of the

555
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,299
framework and not to the one who's

556
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,500
operating that actual scammer website

557
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,100
so I find I think that I will give 10

558
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,860
points for Evil Genius for this guy who

559
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,980
did this one and I also found proof on

560
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,919
the blockchain that some of these nfts

561
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,440
were sent to one address and the others

562
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,000
were sent to this address

563
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,100
so contacted the guy on telegram because

564
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,240
why not

565
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,840
I was interested in why should I buy for

566
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,539
his product on this website if I can get

567
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,860
it for free on GitHub and I also asked

568
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,640
about this obfuscated parts of the

569
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,059
JavaScript code but he did not tell me

570
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,100
that he had the paid version doesn't

571
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,799
have the back doors so I don't know

572
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,600
whether the paid version has the back

573
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,320
door or not

574
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,919
and this is how it looks like in action

575
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,500
so you visit the website you connect

576
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,120
your metamask account

577
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,900
there's this signature I'm not really

578
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,840
sure why it's there but I believe it's

579
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,940
not malicious

580
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,980
and this is the part where most people

581
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,559
will click on confirm and instead of

582
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,740
minting a new token they will give away

583
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,000
their tokens

584
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,100
yeah and uh

585
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,919
I think what

586
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,100
should be done here is that the wallet

587
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,860
software should show the user that okay

588
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,059
if you click on confirm this monkey

589
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,299
picture will go from your wallet to this

590
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:46,740
wallet and maybe people will not click

591
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,760
on confirm anymore

592
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,799
um the whole nft Space is on Discord

593
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,799
nowadays everyone has their own Discord

594
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,940
servers

595
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,520
so clearly there are a lot of Discord

596
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,520
related scams as well like you will get

597
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,779
direct messages all the time

598
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:14,220
you just join any new nft project and

599
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,799
you will instantly get these scammy

600
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,419
messages

601
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,600
and unfortunately I don't have time to

602
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,440
go into the details but nowadays how

603
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,240
Discord servers are hacked are this

604
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,179
interesting hack called bookmarklets

605
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,480
uh hackers will practically convince

606
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,419
Discord admins to

607
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,559
drag and drop from a website a

608
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,100
bookmarklet into their bookmark page and

609
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
then they will convince the admin to

610
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,320
login to Discord

611
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,740
and not many people know that but this

612
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,100
these browser bookmarklets they can run

613
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,100
arbitrary JavaScript code

614
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,520
which means whenever the admin logs in

615
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,679
to Discord and clicks on this

616
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,899
bookmarklet

617
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:12,860
the JavaScript code will steal the

618
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,020
authentication token for the user for

619
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,600
the Discord admin and now the scammers

620
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
can take over the Discord channel the

621
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,940
whole Discord servers

622
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,500
and

623
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,779
in July only more than 100 nft Discord

624
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,539
servers were hacked by this bookmarklet

625
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:37,679
hack so it's really important that at

626
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,960
least you guys know that bookmarklets

627
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,419
are bad and they can run JavaScript

628
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:47,279
there was also a nice research on where

629
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,340
these scammers are spending their money

630
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,740
and they are spending their money on

631
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,360
these ugly

632
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,460
uh watches

633
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,899
and this is the price which was paid for

634
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:01,860
this watch

635
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,039
like I don't know I would not wear it if

636
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,880
you pay me like 10 000 forints but

637
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,220
someone paid this amount of money

638
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,440
because they already had a lot from

639
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,159
these scams

640
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,460
so as you can see uh most people believe

641
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,580
that hacking blockchains and nfts and

642
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,700
such is a very dark and complicated

643
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,840
Magic

644
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,120
but it's mostly just social engineering

645
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,600
I also want to touch a little bit the

646
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,100
hardware wallets

647
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,059
the because what most people don't

648
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:46,200
realize that Hardware wallets are

649
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,039
against the mother on your PC where you

650
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,380
handle your

651
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,080
web free activities

652
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,840
and that's mostly it but if you fall for

653
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,000
this type of scans which I just showed

654
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,600
you

655
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,779
you will use your nft anyway because you

656
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,100
are confirming that transaction

657
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,299
there are very like low-tech uh scams uh

658
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,179
how people are trying to access your

659
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,940
Hardware wallets for example they are

660
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,820
asking for your backup phrase which is

661
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,100
practically the private key for your

662
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,039
wallet

663
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,899
you can also receive some text message

664
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,140
that hey go to this page and update the

665
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,340
firmware on your Hardware wallet

666
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,039
um this is a tricky one uh

667
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,460
they are sending a hardware wallet to

668
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,039
users and the hardware wallet is

669
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,039
pre-configured so whoever sent it

670
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,580
already knows the private key but they

671
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,760
are printing these very convincing

672
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,399
sheets that if you scratch the sheet

673
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,740
then you can access the private key and

674
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,220
use the Ledger this is now how Harvard

675
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,799
wallets work so if you already receive a

676
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,560
backup phrase then someone already knows

677
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,099
that one so don't do that and this is

678
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,679
the low-tech version of the same scam

679
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:23,219
and this is even more interesting

680
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,000
because uh on this you can see a

681
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,780
hardware back door on The Ledger itself

682
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:35,460
and someone added a new SD card to the

683
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,179
hardware Ledger and this is a quite

684
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,540
convincing letter that hey we had a

685
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,219
security issue and you should replace

686
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,219
your Ledger with this new version or

687
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,300
whatever

688
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,899
so clearly some people did put a lot of

689
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:55,379
effort because not many people can do

690
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,859
and add Hardware back doors to Hardware

691
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,960
wallets

692
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,540
so I have some best practices you should

693
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,599
follow clearly don't trust random people

694
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,560
or celebrities on social media

695
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,619
always check the source of your apps or

696
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,500
distributed apps

697
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,060
don't send funds to someone you don't

698
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,700
trust or at least try to verify the

699
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,920
transactions via phone that usually

700
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,839
helps

701
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,440
um if people want to share with you any

702
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,839
type of logins or passwords or private

703
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,820
keys or seed phrase or backup phrases

704
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,880
just block them and don't interact with

705
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,079
them

706
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,180
you should be always extra careful

707
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,700
whenever you interact with either known

708
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,599
or unknown smart contracts because you

709
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,119
can be one click away of losing or your

710
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,160
nft Investments

711
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,680
clearly using password managers is

712
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,560
always a good idea enable two-factor

713
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,960
authentication

714
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,520
text-based

715
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,000
2fa is not good enough anymore

716
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,280
there's a very nice Dark Net Diaries

717
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,420
episode I don't remember which one

718
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,359
but how people are doing these swim

719
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,119
swapping attacks nowadays in the US is

720
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,820
pretty Advanced they are sending kids

721
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,240
into the T-Mobile store and the kids

722
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,780
will steal the tablet from the hand of

723
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,800
the T-Mobile uh people and they have

724
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,880
like five or ten minute window to reset

725
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,320
the telephone account and change that

726
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,880
phone number to another swim SIM card

727
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,839
so as a user you cannot really do

728
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,060
anything against these type of attacks

729
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,040
but it's happening because there's so

730
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,480
much money involved here

731
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,660
if you have a lot of money or already in

732
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,980
cryptocurrencies yeah using Hardware

733
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,820
wallets uh will help you because there's

734
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,359
also a lot of mother trying to hack your

735
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,640
wallets so it will protect against that

736
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,680
one at least

737
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,160
clearly do not use the same Q computer

738
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,880
for game cracks and game hacks which you

739
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,579
use for uh blockchain and web free and

740
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,160
cryptocurrencies

741
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,279
um

742
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,280
using code for let's is a good idea you

743
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,900
just have to

744
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,420
keep your code wallets safe in a way

745
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,579
that 10 years from now you can still

746
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,020
access those

747
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,500
but code wallets are the same that you'd

748
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,020
never bring all of your life savings

749
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,320
with you in your pocket right so you

750
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,800
leave some at home in a safe or whatever

751
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,540
that's the same thing for cold wallets

752
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,480
uh you don't use the same wallet for

753
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,599
interacting scammy websites which you

754
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,640
use which you have nfts and tokens in it

755
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,160
and I think this one this last one is

756
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,859
the most important always take your time

757
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,540
don't rush

758
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,440
like whenever you are seeing this pop-up

759
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,320
that confirmed this transaction

760
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,300
check the website

761
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,760
check the functions check the smart

762
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,460
contracts check how did you get here

763
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,619
take your time don't rush

764
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,040
the nowadays there are also some

765
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,839
security extensions for your browser

766
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,780
like wallet guard or Sunrise nft scan

767
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,099
protector

768
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,740
I personally never use them but some

769
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,200
people say that they are good so if you

770
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,359
want you can experiment with these

771
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,800
um vs could you also want to prevent

772
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,260
these camps and I really wanted to talk

773
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,480
about how we do that unfortunately

774
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,560
lawyers are involved so I can't tell you

775
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,880
but

776
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,640
um yeah fishing

777
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,440
pot Works uh in the cryptocurrency space

778
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,480
and if you know how to fish people then

779
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,700
you can get a lot of Lambos

780
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,640
and

781
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:25,230
[Music]

782
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,060
I'm scared

783
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,720
[Applause]

784
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:43,980
[Music]

785
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,310
let's go

786
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,570
[Music]

787
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,649
[Applause]

788
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,359
[Music]

789
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,970
thank you

790
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,080
[Applause]

791
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,500
any questions thanks awesome questions

792
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,379
or Bitcoin and donations

793
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,859
it's just gonna be a question or

794
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,000
donation

795
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,619
um

796
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,339
so I'm not that familiar uh with how

797
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,320
they uh

798
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,339
technology Works behind web 3.0 but what

799
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,700
bugs me is that everything is logged uh

800
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,000
you get the address that for example the

801
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,160
scammer send the nfts to so why is it so

802
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,640
hard to you know get the valuables back

803
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,800
get the nfts back

804
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
go after it

805
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,859
um I think to answer this question I

806
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,740
feel like I will need like 40 minutes at

807
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,960
least and actually I plan to do a

808
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,480
presentation next year about such

809
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,200
similar topic topic

810
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,060
there are some mixers for example like

811
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,099
tornado cash on the their own network

812
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,500
which makes

813
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,960
following all of these transactions

814
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,200
harder because that's why mixers have

815
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,900
been created and

816
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,920
at the end you see a wallet address

817
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,540
you don't have the ID number of the

818
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,359
scammer you see a wallet address and

819
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,839
sometimes if people if these cameras do

820
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,660
offsack mistakes then you can find them

821
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,020
but if they are really good

822
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,520
that you you just can't so it's like the

823
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,680
whole cryptocurrencies bases both

824
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,160
Anonymous and non-anonymous but you have

825
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,940
to know a lot of things to like if you

826
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,859
are a scammer and you want to do proper

827
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,020
off stack it's hard but

828
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,540
some people can do that

829
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,000
we will see we already know that some of

830
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
these scammers are behind bars

831
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,380
thank you thank you

832
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,619
we have another one

833
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,400
thank you what do you think about the

834
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,700
role of deep fakes in such scams in

835
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,920
general because on this summer we could

836
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,859
see a lot of celebrity deep fakes in

837
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,299
connection with such scams

838
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:52,020
I don't know like what I do know that uh

839
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,859
in the news the very first fraud which

840
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,140
was discussing that defects were used

841
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,240
during this Camp it was not related to

842
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,460
cryptocurrencies at all turned out that

843
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,800
there were no defects involved at the

844
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,460
end

845
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,720
so

846
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,839
I think we will see

847
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,180
if that will be the easiest way for

848
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,839
scammers to scam people then clearly

849
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,520
they will use it

850
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,700
if there are easier ways like these ones

851
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,640
I think as long as these wallet

852
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,640
softwares are this shitty like people

853
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,740
don't know what they are doing there's

854
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,980
no reason to use sophisticated defects

855
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,859
and stuff uh clearly there will be a

856
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,440
base comes cryptocurrency related scans

857
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,920
with defects I don't know we will see

858
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,780
that

859
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,460
thank you

860
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,880
because I'll turn any

861
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,780

862
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,060
