27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
welcome gentlemen

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,880
thank you

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,759
okay welcome everybody

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,880
I also would like to say hello or

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,000
welcome to the viewers on the Stream

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,720
in the next 40-45 minutes we are going

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,340
to talk about

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,040
our experiences that we collected in the

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,380
last seven years during Automotive

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,900
penetration testing projects

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,340
who we are my name is Laszlo I have more

38
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,979
than 20 years experience in

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,200
cyber especially in the penetration

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,780
testing and one of my responsibilities

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,119
at the workplace to build our Automotive

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,240
cyber lab and knowledge

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,060
hello everyone

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,680
working together with classroom also

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,538
have strong background implementation

46
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,140
testing and I.T security and I'm working

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
on Automotive cyber and penetration

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,720
testing projects since 2015. I'm also

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,060
responsible for car hacking and Hardware

50
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,580
hacking services in our team and build

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,680
several stuff for for our clients

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
including car hacking training

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,940
environments that we also provide for

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,620
oems and t1s for example

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,580
okay what we are going to talk about the

56
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
presentation will have three main

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,019
section the first section we'll talk

58
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,739
about why we should uh focus and out on

59
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,040
these cyber topics the next one

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,400
uh we'll we'll talk about why we have to

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,160
deal or how we can deal with this

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,140
complexity that we will describe in the

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,660
first section and the last one we we

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,700
brought you some examples of course we

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,160
cannot show you the examples from our

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,739
clients but we built some interesting

67
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,540
stuff for you

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,480
so the first part of the Y so I'm old

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,940
enough to know that we were quite happy

70
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,560
when at the beginning we have just a

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,260
radio and the CD player in our cars and

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,239
we were quite happy if it was capable to

73
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,519
play an MPC CD

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,180
and then the small screen appeared in

75
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,959
the car and it had a GPS service and the

76
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,599
number of vcu's in the vehicle was quite

77
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,620
low this use meaning the small number of

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,080
computers inside the vehicle meaning the

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,379
embedded systems

80
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,299
but lots of change happened in the last

81
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,459
10 years the mobile phone appeared

82
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,200
everybody wanted to connect the mobile

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,900
phone to the car use it charge it so USB

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,299
Bluetooth appear there then if the

85
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,860
mobile phone is so useful inside the

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,799
vehicle why we don't do not install a

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,659
SIM card in the vehicle itself so have

88
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,120
its own mobile connection if it is has

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,180
its own mobile connection why we don't

90
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,299
connect to the internet already and if

91
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,400
it has an internet why we don't have

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,799
this internet with the passengers we

93
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,680
tested car who has three different virus

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,079
networks in it

95
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,000
and if you have the internet connection

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,900
or a GSM connection or 3G 4G why we

97
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,520
don't connect to a backend system and

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,440
start collecting data

99
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,139
and if you have a backup system why we

100
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,720
don't allow the owners of the vehicle to

101
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,460
use the same package system with a

102
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,000
mobile application or a web application

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,100
there were another Trends the number of

104
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,500
ecu's the small embedded system inside

105
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,340
the vehicle increased dramatically the

106
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,740
first car we tested seven years ago had

107
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,160
60 50 ecu's in it

108
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,560
but of course the development didn't

109
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,139
stop here everybody talks about

110
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,560
autonomous driving

111
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,259
system so we we need new sensors and

112
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,180
cameras I'm not opening the debit here

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,060
someone says new sensor someone says

114
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,639
lots of cameras the main message here

115
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,919
you need more components inside the

116
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,419
vehicle

117
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,000
moreover there are new protocols when

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,040
they are saying okay the autonomous

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,020
things will be much better if the

120
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,060
vehicle can talk to the infrastructure

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,940
can go to another vehicle

122
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,880
as a summer vehicle to every single

123
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,660
vehicle too it's it's a very complex pki

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,220
based protocol

125
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,940
some others some other cells you need a

126
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,979
high Precision mop to be able to perform

127
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,440
the autonomous driving so none of their

128
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
back-end solution but and I'm not

129
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,639
talking about the Google Maps where the

130
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,280
car should constantly update what he

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,860
sees or what it sees and also

132
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,440
constructive request information what he

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,580
can what it can expect

134
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,139
so if we are talking about the

135
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,419
autonomous driving then the car has to

136
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,400
make decisions so we need a powerful

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,100
computer that able to run machine

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,660
learning models

139
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,960
but if we have autonomous driving we

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,940
have to entertain not just the

141
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,400
passengers but the drivers also

142
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
and we need more powerful computers to

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,000
entertain

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,699
so basically from this we we are

145
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,440
reaching this level so maybe the Light

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,560
Rider won't be a Sci-Fi anymore

147
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,919
but let's translate this to or let's

148
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,500
brought this down to the ground

149
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,960
with this simple diagram so basically

150
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,419
what we are seeing is that we have many

151
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,000
many backend Solutions clouds and so on

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,919
we had a vehicle he has its own

153
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,199
interfaces with wireless we had

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
application like mobile application web

155
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,840
application so basically everything that

156
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,240
we did in the last 15 years just

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,919
increased the attack surface of the

158
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,199
vehicle and all of the components can be

159
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,440
Target

160
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,460
besides that the interior of the vehicle

161
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,360
system

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,660
complexity just increased you can see a

163
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,600
very rudimentary example on the screen

164
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,639
the first car we tested had 18 different

165
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,580
buses that connected the ecu's together

166
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,180
that 50 60 ecu's and that bus system can

167
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,720
be different it can become can bus

168
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,080
Automotive attirement Flex rate most and

169
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,599
lean and one of the main aim of the auto

170
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,500
cast is to change the vehicle behavior

171
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,419
and to able to change the vehicle

172
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,460
Behavior they have to understand what's

173
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,319
happening inside the vehicle

174
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,660
therefore we have we have to protect

175
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,039
that one

176
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
complex system also

177
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,919
and in the future they are talking about

178
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,199
or there are already cars out there

179
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,500
talking about software-defined vehicles

180
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,560
and just it's a it's a it meaning a lot

181
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,800
of lots of things and it's a wide topic

182
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,539
uh the only things that I'm showing you

183
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,819
just as an interesting stuff

184
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,560
the embedded system getting more and

185
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,360
more powerful so the issue is getting

186
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,060
more more and more powerful so what you

187
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,380
saw in the I.T world that the

188
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,080
virtualization appeared and once had

189
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,120
that started to support multiple roles

190
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,099
this happening inside your cars

191
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,580
so basically the conclusion of this

192
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
section is that the new technologies are

193
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
there they connect to our car even they

194
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,700
will drive overcast and the vehicle now

195
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,339
is part of a complex ecosystem

196
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,860
and the vehicle itself is quite complex

197
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,620
and this new ecosystem is vulnerable to

198
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,019
the same cyber risk as any other ID

199
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,380
Network

200
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,100
and

201
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,080
of course the automobile industry

202
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,540
recognized this quite early and and

203
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,140
investing heavily and how early it was

204
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,140
all of these research results that I'm

205
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,839
or presentations that I'm going what I'm

206
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,360
showing and the slides right now is from

207
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,459
Seventh six years ago so 2015 and 2016.

208
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,640
and I choose these because

209
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,600
they represent quite well all of the

210
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,700
components of the connected vehicle

211
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,160
ecosystem can be Target of an attack

212
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
of course the crown breaking one was the

213
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,959
Charlie Millen at least and I'm

214
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,480
considering it is not just because they

215
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,740
were first

216
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,740
but basically the research paper is just

217
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,100
a map how do you should set up your

218
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,660
Automotive penetration testing

219
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,839
methodology only one thing missed from

220
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,940
that paper is the backend system but

221
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,880
event after the Wi-Fi the

222
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,100
gsm network they found the vulnerability

223
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,560
in the infotainment with Hardware

224
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,300
hacking and reverse engineering they

225
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,760
learned how to bypass game filtering you

226
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,300
will later what it is and also

227
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,500
retrievers engineering techniques they

228
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,140
learned what they should send to the car

229
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,660
is used to change the behavior of the

230
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,300
vehicle so the whole picture

231
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,880
the next one the semicam car is a very

232
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,399
good example that their variant and

233
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,260
vulnerabilities in the vehicle itself

234
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,540
but the mobile application that did some

235
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,700
control on the vehicle didn't check the

236
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,620
server certificate so it was easy to

237
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,060
manage the middle it

238
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
the next one

239
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,019
is an instant Leaf case it's not about

240
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,120
the

241
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,160
car as well but the back-end system and

242
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,899
the application basically it

243
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,760
authenticated the request from the

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
mobile application that control the car

245
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,160
just with the VIN number and the vehicle

246
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,019
identification number which can be

247
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,120
considered public because in some cases

248
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,339
it can be brute force or you can walk up

249
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,279
a car outside and check on the winds the

250
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,180
windshield

251
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,740
the next one

252
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,980
uh they could they did many many things

253
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,579
but what I liked and shows very well you

254
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,860
have to focus on the cyber security for

255
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,200
the vehicle whole life cycle of the

256
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
vehicle which meaning not just in the

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,820
design phase and and this sop we start

258
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,579
the production but until it is on the

259
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,899
road

260
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,360
because what they did is just just dump

261
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,880
the infotainment system of the of an

262
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
older car and they find a URL in it and

263
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,440
the domain part of the URL wasn't

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
registered anymore so they registered it

265
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,980
and cars started to talk to the system

266
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,760
and the last one is a very simple one

267
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,980
in this case there weren't any back-end

268
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,380
system it was the mobile phone and the

269
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,260
car but the Wi-Fi network the car

270
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,120
provided has a

271
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
weak Wi-Fi password because the

272
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,980
generation of the password wasn't random

273
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,519
enough so they were able to crack it

274
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,800
WPA2 quite common technique and then

275
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,300
talk to the car and the mobile

276
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,640
application security of that protocol

277
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,000
security relied on the Wi-Fi security so

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,680
they were able to switch off the alarm

279
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,420
system

280
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,240
so as a summary of this slide all of

281
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,519
these things shows very well every

282
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,560
component of the connected ecosystem can

283
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,480
be a Target and the automotive industry

284
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,880
knows very well this research just

285
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,800
published 2015 and 2016.

286
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,380
and started invested heavily moreover

287
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,680
The Regulators also realized there may

288
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,980
be a problem arriving here so there are

289
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,660
regulations out there and there are

290
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,940
standards over there and this is not the

291
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,060
conference to go deep dive into this the

292
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,279
main message the Day messages are the

293
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
following

294
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,940
all of the standard says you have to

295
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,579
deal with the you need a cyber security

296
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,399
management system that has to deal with

297
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,500
the cyber cycle of the car for the whole

298
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,959
life cycle so not under your start of

299
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,899
reflection but after that as well

300
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,779
and they are already in effect in some

301
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,940
countries in the unec countries

302
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,240
which means if somebody released a new

303
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,279
model in 22 July or after 22 July they

304
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,980
were able they should able to prove they

305
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,899
have this csms and the card level of

306
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,000
that way because they cannot homologate

307
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,600
it in other way from 2024 they have to

308
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
do this

309
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,740
I mean after Adam

310
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,300
they have to do this for all the car

311
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,720
that they're selling currently

312
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,060
and this leads us to another topic so in

313
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,480
the last seven years we experienced a

314
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,660
considerable Improvement of the new

315
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,040
vehicle models or new cars on the street

316
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,339
which means for example the anti-level

317
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,579
are considerable increased the Gateway

318
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,040
model that separates different buses is

319
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,600
not just translates between the

320
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,639
different bus types but also have

321
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,560
security functions like filter income

322
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,399
messages

323
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,459
uh the can FD or Automotive internet

324
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,459
provide enough bandwidth to apply some

325
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,779
security measures under communication

326
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,360
the simply connecting to the obb2 by a

327
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,760
technician and perform a privileged

328
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,899
actions like uh replacing a firmware

329
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,079
it's not enough anymore it may require a

330
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,940
strong authentication including an

331
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,680
online system

332
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,600
and the firm is getting digitally

333
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,779
digitally signed and encrypted so the so

334
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,339
our conclusion is that that the

335
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,399
penetration testing researching or car

336
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,160
hacking is

337
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,320
getting more and more complicated it's

338
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
not just simple plugin in the odbt port

339
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
and and you are good

340
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,180
so how we can deal with this complexity

341
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,480
and this new uh increase security and

342
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,060
now I'm going to stay the obvious so

343
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,480
basically you need a lab you need a team

344
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,279
and you need a methodology

345
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,940
regarding the team

346
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,920
you saw that the connected vehicle

347
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,880
ecosystem is contains everything that a

348
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,519
modern iot system can contain an

349
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,160
independent station testing industry we

350
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,500
already specialized so somebody good at

351
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,420
web hacking mobile hacking somebody good

352
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,220
at the hardware hacking somebody good at

353
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,500
direct teaming so you need a diverse

354
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
team to be able to handle this

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,440
complexity

356
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,899
regarding the lobby environment

357
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,600
because you need to do Hardware hacking

358
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
to make to understand how the car works

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,480
then we need special devices to conduct

360
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,060
this Hardware hacking moreover you need

361
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,660
you it's not just arm or Intel you can

362
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,540
find and many other special mcu's or

363
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,360
CPUs that you should able to handle

364
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,459
the car that are especially the bus

365
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,220
system as we mentioned which means you

366
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,680
need Flex lay interface Automotive

367
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,260
interface can enter this can is easy the

368
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,880
other two is getting a little bit

369
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,139
expensive

370
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,260
the out of the industry had serious long

371
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,300
last uh

372
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,600
long time on the market Southwest tax to

373
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,220
develop their cars

374
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,260
and this software stack and they are

375
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,240
using this so fast text to simulation of

376
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,300
the car of the ecu's behavior and as a

377
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,040
pen tester you may need it because if

378
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,380
you just received an ECU most of the

379
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,899
cases the ECU needs the other ecu's to

380
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,760
behave prepared meaning receiving the

381
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,459
right cam messages and or write messages

382
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,240
and automat and its interfaces and you

383
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,100
have to simulate that this code AS bus

384
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,199
simulation

385
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,620
and of course I already mentioned to you

386
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,199
that the special debug excitement like

387
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,420
this loud airbag stuff

388
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,699
to be able to connect the Specialists

389
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,759
use and debug at the special MCU CPUs

390
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,720
and debug at that level

391
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,699
the next and the last thing is the

392
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,920
methodology that you need

393
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
but the Cyber industry does when he sees

394
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,899
a complexity and it's hard to decide

395
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,839
what to test so if you meet a car that

396
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,359
has 50 60 ecu's hell of a lot of

397
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,880
functionalities what to test

398
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,640
or what to secure then they are doing

399
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,099
this threat and risk assessment things

400
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,980
that basically who is your attackers

401
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,900
what they want to do what they want to

402
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,179
reach what kind of functionalities you

403
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,280
have what kind of attack surface you

404
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,199
have and going behind the boss and you

405
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,760
will receive

406
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
results that you can end up in a test

407
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,260
plan

408
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,740
but as as the regulations and the

409
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,660
Thunder says you have to do with this at

410
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,340
the beginning of the development to know

411
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,380
what kind of security controls like

412
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,260
security goals you should have

413
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,900
as a pen tester this information is

414
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,460
really good because then you can

415
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,860
formulate a flexible test plan but you

416
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,480
should go after

417
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,700
and then you have to test a vehicle

418
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,440
before start of production this is

419
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,380
creation to be able to use your

420
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,919
resources effectively

421
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,340
of course sometimes you don't have these

422
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,280
dollar results so it's better if you are

423
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,100
prepared your own that is focused on the

424
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,559
pen testing task what are the typical

425
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,900
requests that we receive test the whole

426
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,240
vehicle test the functionality of the

427
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,280
vehicle or test just one easy or one

428
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,100
component of the vehicle the tap ending

429
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,500
and the scope and the resources

430
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,140
you will do that typical test types from

431
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,860
Hardware hunting entered until until the

432
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,000
back end

433
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,780
and just only one comment from me that I

434
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,299
said you can see the sentence on the

435
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,520
slide the penetration testing should be

436
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,039
integrated in the v model

437
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,140
I'm not explaining what is the model

438
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,539
right now but basically what it means

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
if you start the penetration as a

440
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,860
testing activities early meaning there

441
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,740
is a CPU there is an ECU ready or there

442
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,480
is a functional Theory a new door pen

443
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
testing activities then you have to do

444
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,160
less testing activities when the car is

445
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,200
ready and before starts the production

446
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,539
production you do the final penetration

447
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,419
testing so you basically in a in this

448
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,360
complex system setup you have to do or

449
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,280
build up a hierarchy of testing

450
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,960
activities

451
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,320
and now we're going to the how and I'm

452
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,260
passing over to Andres

453
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,640
Okay so

454
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,740
to provide you some examples how these

455
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,520
testing activities are ending up in

456
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,660
methodologies we provided you some

457
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,480
examples so for example starting with

458
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,340
bus and interface testing that is the

459
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,679
most common testing activity against the

460
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,600
car

461
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,120
and take canvas the most important

462
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,940
Communication System since 20 years in

463
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,919
the card

464
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,320
what can you do with can bus testing the

465
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,299
common knowledge is that you go to the

466
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,059
car with a small OBD plug plug it inside

467
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,340
the car it has Bluetooth connection or

468
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,039
Wi-Fi connection this Elm chipset based

469
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,320
plus can be purchased from AliExpress

470
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,179
for two bucks and you are ready to go

471
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,820
ready to hack your cars maybe it is good

472
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,460
for a really good diagnostic codes or

473
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,200
maybe to to clear out error codes but in

474
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,380
fact it is not sufficient and good

475
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,480
enough for perform any kind of

476
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,539
meaningful car hacking the OBD port and

477
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,400
access to the in-vehicle networks

478
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,360
through OBD Port was possible without or

479
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
with very few limitations in earlier

480
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,539
models where the Gateway did not make

481
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,120
proper filtering so there should not be

482
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,240
a case right nowadays where from the OBD

483
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,860
Port from external communication

484
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,020
interface you have any kind of

485
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,700
possibility to have influence for

486
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,860
example on a safety critical buses or

487
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,720
components so it is filtered it is

488
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
blocking you you cannot send inside a

489
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,460
message from external interface and you

490
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,200
won't see any kind of communication that

491
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,820
is actually happening in sensitive bus

492
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,919
systems but still what you can do with

493
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,140
it in case of penetration testing we

494
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,059
typically starts backwards so meaning

495
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,700
with full access and direct access to

496
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,440
the issue to given bus to the given

497
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,780
components so we go there we tap there

498
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,700
and perform the testing activities there

499
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,880
and if you find anything at this stage

500
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
or at this point then we step backwards

501
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,039
and check from where this can be

502
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,559
exploited from some areas from a

503
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,419
different bus system to true under their

504
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,400
components or from different entry

505
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,159
points so in case of canvas system it is

506
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,900
no longer just you know capturing

507
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,460
something replaying and enjoying the

508
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,840
results because that was happening

509
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,419
before nowadays sensitive communication

510
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,880
is protected it is there is a secular

511
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,960
Security on board Communications message

512
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,419
authenticity and integrity is protected

513
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,780
which is in case of standard can 2.8 is

514
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,700
quite limited due to the limited Aid

515
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,220
buys that you can use in messages but

516
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,799
the industry has already introduced can

517
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,440
FD for example which uh much bigger

518
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,340
payload size where feasible protection

519
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,280
hmax can be used for example on the

520
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,220
messages still the same applies to flex

521
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,580
Ray and especially for automotive

522
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,919
ethernet so in case of this bus testing

523
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,659
level activities we definitely go

524
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,059
against sensitive features and functions

525
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,020
against the ECU and diagnostic because

526
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,460
this is one of the most important

527
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,919
something that could Target it by

528
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,140
another care diagnostic May provide

529
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,179
access to the internet as an extracting

530
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,780
of ROM contents flash contents or may

531
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,000
provide ability to attack air to

532
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,280
manipulate the issue somewhere so

533
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,039
bypassing Security checks authentication

534
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,860
controls and stuff like these are all in

535
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,400
scope of this type of testing activities

536
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,820
as due to the complexity and the

537
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,280
increasing amount of bandwidth needed by

538
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
the functionalities in the car

539
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,900
automotive internet appeared and

540
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,080
introduced to the vehicles this is on

541
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,659
one side a very great Improvement to the

542
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,039
whole infrastructure and to the

543
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,400
possibilities and they already

544
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,559
made thousands of well-known

545
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,860
Technologies available at the cars and

546
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,460
so you can easily find the HTTP service

547
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,159
or ssh in the car that uses for example

548
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
Automotive internet but on the other

549
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,260
hand it also introduces introduced the

550
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,760
same vulnerabilities that's the

551
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,340
traditional iot systems has so you can

552
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,120
now use a standard vulnerability scanner

553
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,539
that will map your components scan the

554
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,299
IP addresses scan the ports and look for

555
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,700
a traditional vulnerabilities and use

556
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,340
traditional I.T security knowledge to

557
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,340
Target the car of course there are Auto

558
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,460
Automotive specific protocols solutions

559
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,260
that needs to be tested and evaluated

560
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,360
and this is all part of the security

561
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,860
testing activities here

562
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,520
Hardware hacking on component level is

563
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,860
always a very important part of the

564
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,039
penetration testing because

565
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,500
you will see it later

566
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,940
different approaches different testing

567
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,159
activities against the same Target May

568
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,360
provide you some important

569
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,059
findings that can use later in a

570
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,320
different stage of the testing

571
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,059
activities in case of circuit level

572
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,980
assessment and the hardware hacking we

573
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,039
always go after the given Hardware we

574
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,720
check what kind of chip is used what

575
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,919
kind of security features are available

576
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,159
whether your sensitive data is stored

577
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,000
inside or outside of the microcontroller

578
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,400
trying to extract sensitive data access

579
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,100
to Diagnostic and debug interfaces load

580
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,320
of communication inspection between

581
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,039
different components talking about chip

582
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,679
to chip communication interfaces and so

583
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,500
on are all in scope and this is in

584
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,600
parallel with the firmware level

585
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,960
assessment where which can happen if you

586
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,480
are able to to extract the firmware for

587
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,000
example from the target itself or from a

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,299
firmware update process during the

589
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,520
diagnostic and flashing process or you

590
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,440
received it for the penetration testing

591
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,080
and firmware level assessment it could

592
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,900
and may help you by identifying

593
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,260
sensitive features relevant from

594
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,620
security perspective and help you

595
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,320
identifying those sweet points that you

596
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,419
need to investigate deeper so for

597
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,640
example check how the secure boot is

598
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,100
implemented how how key validation is

599
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
performed or how sensitive features are

600
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
protected inside of the ECU these are

601
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,140
working in hand in hand and just to make

602
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,140
you more comfortable with this testing

603
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,820
approach we provide you some examples

604
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,880
starting with

605
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,940
uh connected testing approach against an

606
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,100
Eco this is one of my favorite examples

607
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,159
because it shows you very well how a

608
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,720
different testing activities could help

609
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
each other so we had a Target ECU that

610
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,260
uses a high-end

611
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,400
state-of-the-art microcontroller with

612
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,240
plenty of security features included and

613
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,980
we started with the

614
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,580
Hardware hacking so open the box go down

615
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,159
investigate it with microscope tap for

616
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,419
the right points with the right

617
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,640
debuggers investigated the communication

618
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,100
with logic analyzers between components

619
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,140
and so on but there was nothing serious

620
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,000
there so at after a certain amount of

621
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,240
time and with the finished test cases we

622
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,700
decided that we had to stop there so we

623
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,620
switched to interface level testing

624
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,020
activities where we jump back to the can

625
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,120
bus and perform the bus testing and

626
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,679
interface level testing activity is

627
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,039
there it turned out that there was a

628
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,659
service there that was vulnerable for

629
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,200
um because of a weak implementation and

630
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,779
this Diagnostic and calibration protocol

631
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,539
made it possible to access those

632
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,720
sensitive memory areas that was not

633
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
supposed to be accessible by the

634
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,100
externals so especially not without

635
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,460
authentication and by knowing the memory

636
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,200
structure of the talk at MCU we know

637
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,480
where the sensitive information were

638
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,880
stored for example for the gtag lock

639
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,659
password and we simply extracted the

640
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,179
sensitive content from the

641
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,400
microcontroller through the vulnerable

642
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,000
series over the can bus having access to

643
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,980
this sensitive information it was

644
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,779
possible to go back to the hardware

645
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,779
investigation go back to the debugger

646
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,260
interface unlock the microcontroller

647
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,659
unit with the gtag analog password and

648
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,520
have full control over the

649
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,220
microcontroller the code execution have

650
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,080
direct access to the whole firmware and

651
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
every key materials used inside of the

652
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,140
ECU meaning secure onboard communication

653
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,440
Biscay materials key materials for

654
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,260
firmware cryptography and signature

655
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,120
validation and everything that is

656
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,760
necessary to compromise the ECU or

657
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,580
manipulate it so this is clearly shows

658
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,240
how testing from one single perspective

659
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,100
on one single entry point is not enough

660
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,440
money you have to combine different kind

661
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,400
of testing activities

662
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,039
foreign

663
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,539
Andre I should already explained that

664
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,760
why the automotive attendant appeared

665
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,100
inside the vehicles basically it was

666
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,279
bandwidth related of the audio video

667
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,400
stuff but as it opened to many other

668
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,960
possibilities

669
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,000
and the alternative industry realized

670
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,679
they need a protocol

671
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,340
that where the ecu's can call functions

672
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,980
of each other or one is you can notify

673
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,520
another ECU and this

674
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,940
and that's why the semip was born

675
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,580
basically it's an RPC protocol and it's

676
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,980
a service disk of aripotocol and the

677
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,539
behavior is

678
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,120
quite simple

679
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,059
it or it seems simple

680
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,539
the ecu's that have functionalities to

681
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,720
call or events to send out advertise

682
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,419
this and they are advertising this to

683
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,179
the multicast addresses so if you are

684
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,220
already inside the automotive internet

685
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,880
and you just sniff you'll be don't you

686
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,140
don't do any man in the middle attack

687
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,520
just sniff you will uh receive this

688
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,140
advertisement and you can see

689
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,899
what kind of events are there or what

690
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,520
kind of functions are there basically

691
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,620
you will see numbers

692
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,760
like event ID service ID and this kind

693
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,520
of information another issue if you

694
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,700
would if he wants to receive an event

695
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,240
from the from the given ECU he can just

696
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,580
send a subscribe if you receive And

697
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,039
subscribe and later when the event

698
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,700
happens he get received a notification

699
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,600
the this is how it looks on the network

700
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,880
of course this example that I developed

701
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,299
for demonstration purposes if you see in

702
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,820
the car that can be much much more many

703
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,740
many services and many many events

704
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,200
that's why it's not easy to find out

705
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,419
which are cyber relevant

706
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,580
and the main problem with the some IP

707
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,000
protocol is that that by default it

708
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
doesn't contain security so you have to

709
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,140
add the additional cyber security

710
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,720
layer yourself like protect Automotive

711
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,760
ethernet with ipsec

712
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,740
so but if the attacker is already inside

713
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,980
you can see this kind of packets as you

714
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,860
can see the the

715
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,559
service Discovery packages just sent out

716
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,299
to multicast

717
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,460
and you can subscribe and you view this

718
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,220
even acknowledge and another care can

719
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,820
does the same

720
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,059
it's very simple and how simple it is

721
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,159
this is a sample python script that I

722
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,940
wrote

723
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,899
it's Baseline scappy they are known

724
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:33,059
Swiss army knife packet handling it for

725
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,120
for python

726
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,159
this code just send out a subscribe

727
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,620
things basically put together the summer

728
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,440
some IP packets in the right way the

729
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,220
scappy has the some IP module to support

730
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,460
this and you in the Subscribe message

731
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,919
you just have to tell I would like to

732
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,779
receive the events and this IP address

733
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,760
and this port

734
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,000
so this is how short this python script

735
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,320
is

736
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,720
and the next python clip just shows

737
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,960
using the same scappy module how to

738
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
sniff under interface and waiting for

739
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,320
the given event

740
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,779
and if you receive the given event then

741
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,419
just start

742
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,299
something do something and basically the

743
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,399
events there to learn something new

744
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,260
happened inside the vehicle so some

745
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,880
actions will happen

746
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,700
and in this case is quite how can I say

747
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,120
that basic because it's just downloading

748
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,740
a file from the server for the

749
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,159
demonstration purposes

750
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,279
I'm not telling anymore

751
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,880
and now we are switching to the firmware

752
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,140
case

753
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,600
or the leaders engineering staff

754
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,880
the main problem with the automotive

755
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,640
reverse engineering is tool Force first

756
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,380
you can easily find a very exotic CPU

757
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,600
that is not in the normality where the

758
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,419
iot word and a binary firmware there is

759
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,940
no operating system for it so you have

760
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,159
to learn how to reverse that the second

761
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,440
thing is that you will find a quite a

762
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,919
normal ECU with the normal operating CPU

763
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,320
with a normal operating system but with

764
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,840
a highly complex software stack

765
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,500
above this operating system and you will

766
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,299
have to learn how to find out what to

767
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,039
test

768
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,740
and what what you can do for example if

769
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,019
you find an operating system

770
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,659
with a heavy software stack you would

771
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,460
like to learn which processes are

772
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,980
interesting which processes has some

773
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,960
cyber functionality or network functions

774
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,260
listening and canvas Network or the

775
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,659
typical Hardware interfaces like serial

776
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,320
SPI i2c you want to learn which one is

777
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,279
used cryptography how the startup works

778
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,360
how you can

779
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,279
change the startup functions and then

780
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,779
you have to make the decision whether

781
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,559
focused or or a little bit General

782
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:06,539
reverse engineering applied

783
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,239
and I'm going to show you uh two

784
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,320
examples for this the first one I chose

785
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,960
because just have the opportunity to

786
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,820
talk about the automotive grade Linux

787
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,879
it's an alliance many many oems meaning

788
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,960
car producers and field ones that

789
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,199
create issues to the uh to the car

790
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,780
producers

791
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,760
supports this Alliance they may aim to

792
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,899
create a

793
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,219
Southwest Tech apis

794
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:41,879
interfaces that makes the Linux usable

795
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,859
inside the vehicle and not just the

796
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,918
infotainment but for the for safety

797
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,800
critical systems time to times the

798
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,300
releasing demos

799
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,460
on your screen you can see an info

800
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,619
screenshot from the infotainment demo

801
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,960
but also the doing demo for the

802
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,820
instrument cluster

803
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,500
and just uh telling you there was a they

804
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,359
already started to using container

805
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,800
technology in there

806
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,200
so the complexity on from the it system

807
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,680
starts arriving inside our vehicles

808
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,940
so

809
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,540
this is a very simple sample I wanted to

810
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,540
learn how I can find out which process

811
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,680
in this area demo system

812
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,960
you uses the canvas

813
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,000
and the Linux system it can be easy

814
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
because that is the circuit can in the

815
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,220
Linux scanner which is quite stable and

816
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,240
usable

817
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,820
and you just need a tool that tells you

818
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,940
when you list the open stack and the

819
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,040
system which one is candle

820
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,500
so on the screen you can see it was the

821
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,079
process 331 there is another python

822
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,700
based process but it's a long story

823
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,560
three

824
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,079
one and then I'm just applying the van

825
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,740
on stress two go after the center and

826
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,079
I'm starting to see the cam messages if

827
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,240
you look at the another side of the

828
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,220
slide you can see which kind of Cam

829
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,060
message was sent out by that process and

830
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,640
you can see the same cam messages in the

831
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,300
stress output

832
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,240
x64 x64 of course in the real life in

833
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
the real life was totally it can be

834
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,400
totally different I was I had a case

835
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,300
then he would start for a stack and

836
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,980
there were no circuit game but can

837
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,339
message leave the ECU and it required

838
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,560
that lots of debugging and reverse

839
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,260
engineering just to find out the using a

840
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,540
special serial line a special devices

841
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,780
and the cam message was just packaged

842
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,839
into an another protocol to the Syria

843
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,700
line and it somehow ended up in the

844
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,540
under canvas

845
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,619
but at the end of the day we were able

846
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:53,700
to

847
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,520
uh write a python script that simulates

848
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,359
this

849
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,500
the another door my last example

850
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,020
is

851
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,839
sometimes in this tutor iot word you

852
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,640
have to do a general things to just

853
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,980
learn what to do with the with the

854
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,000
firmware

855
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,780
and

856
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,160
in the custom developed bar from the

857
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,200
custom bundle of libraries you find a

858
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,640
custom Library

859
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,040
that does some interesting things the

860
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,740
next thing you would ask which other

861
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,339
binary uses that Library it's quite easy

862
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,020
to find out to be honest on a Linux

863
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,880
system you can check for example the

864
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,760
open files and which process opened at

865
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,660
uh

866
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,200
a library but doing this for many

867
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,160
it gets time consuming so that's why

868
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,460
what I did is develop the very

869
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,859
small just couple of hundreds line

870
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:53,460
python script that basically goes goes

871
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,099
through the binaries goes through the

872
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,859
libraries and builds a graph and the

873
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,140
graph tests did binary code this library

874
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,000
and this Library called this Library

875
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,400
this Library called this library and I

876
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,240
also collects with which function were

877
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,880
imported into which libraries

878
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,940
find the screen and Y graph because

879
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,220
there are lots of easy to use tool even

880
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,079
graphical tools that you can use to

881
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,780
search a graph or analyze it

882
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,820
and the skin you can see a screenshot of

883
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,760
this this is from our training automatic

884
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,280
pen test training we developed a tool

885
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,180
that listened and this area port and

886
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,500
authenticated the user and the serial

887
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,859
port and this tool is the diagram tool

888
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,079
and you can see what which kind of

889
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,380
libraries it used it's a simple case

890
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,079
it used the lip crypto Library which is

891
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,000
part of the open SSR

892
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,880
the tool itself that I use with the

893
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,680
sitoscape I don't know how to pronounce

894
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,940
it

895
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,880
but basically just searching for

896
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,560
functions

897
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,260
it shows very well

898
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,020
the direct term interactively crypto and

899
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,460
using this function

900
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,700
of course in a real scenario where I

901
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,800
just developed this you you will have

902
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
much more results and you can really

903
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,480
starts to work how to reverse engineer

904
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,400
or learn which one is important and

905
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,619
which one is that and then you can use

906
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,700
your jitra if the given CPU is supported

907
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,859
to do the reverse engineering of course

908
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm not going to

909
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,859
explain the reverse engineering process

910
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,480
right now

911
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,420
but whenever you have the function and

912
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,339
you have the function that call then you

913
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,500
have the binary from that point on it's

914
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,579
easy

915
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,240
and you ending yeah I draw this Asgard

916
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,060
but anyway at the at the end you just

917
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,180
can find out the authentication happened

918
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,740
from this file

919
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,920
and it was an md5 version you can crack

920
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,260
it but this is just an example from our

921
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,460
or training

922
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,099
but in the reverse scenario this method

923
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,800
that I just showed you had me had me

924
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,839
find a lot of vulnerabilities and and we

925
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,140
crypto usage and keys and crypto keys in

926
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,598
files unprotected and so on and so on

927
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,220
so the summary

928
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,760
the vehicles complex currently under

929
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,220
heavy change so maybe there will be

930
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,079
fewer number of ecu's because of the

931
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,599
electrification but that given ecu's

932
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,880
will be much more complex and does many

933
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,140
many things

934
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,660
the ecosystem around this is around the

935
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,520
car just getting more and more

936
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,560
complicated because the automotive

937
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
industry from business perspective would

938
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,820
like to serve you with many many

939
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,040
services that you are paying for

940
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,839
um that's why we should handle the whole

941
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,839
ecosystem

942
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,280
and that's why the automotive

943
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,320
penetration testing right now is a team

944
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,640
effort

945
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,839
you need wide variety of expertise and

946
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,480
you need a velocity lab

947
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,720
to perform it there but

948
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,180
it should not stop you it still can be

949
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,240
fun for researchers and hobbyists and I

950
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,940
just put here some pictures to prove

951
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,960
that

952
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,079
for example this two picture is from

953
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,140
Andres car because in our training did

954
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,900
we use the instrument cluster and this

955
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,420
instrument cluster we have to learn how

956
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,599
the cam messages are working and as you

957
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,500
can see it was just dismantled and we he

958
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,040
we just connected to the canvas

959
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,800
not not an odb2 of course so some

960
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,680
dismantling required another fun fact

961
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,140
that I wanted to share with you

962
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,920
this is a very expensive canvas device

963
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,660
hell of a lot of money

964
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,380
this is USB team how much 20 about 20

965
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,560
bucks yeah 20 dollars

966
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,980
and most of the case even with in

967
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,780
professional cases that we are doing

968
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,440
it's enough

969
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,420
so maybe you don't need this and of

970
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,460
course there are lots of things where

971
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,760
you can just use two set learn like

972
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Automotive breakdowns how this new shiny

973
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,920
cars are working

974
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,200
and of course you can start to build

975
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,800
your own environment and practice

976
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,560
so thank you very much that was that we

977
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,540
wanted to share and I hope you will

978
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,640
enjoy the rest of the activity as well

979
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,760
thank you to Laszlo and andrash I think

980
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,320
we have time for

981
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,880
a quick question or two if we have any

982
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,680
oh here we go

983
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,619
hi thanks for the great talk so one of

984
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,280
the main takeaways for me was that the

985
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,099
whole evolving industry is still a wild

986
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,680
west like lots of complex new technology

987
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,680
and all my question is as a

988
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,599
cryptographer is that whether you

989
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,720
encountered architectural decisional

990
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,460
problems so not like implementation

991
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,640
Hardware level issues in cryptography

992
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,980
because in in LA in your line of work

993
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,020
because last time I heard

994
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,859
Bosch had some super Niche

995
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,020
non-standardized way of doing PKA and

996
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,520
firmware signing because turns out that

997
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,859
pki Hardware is too expensive for a car

998
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,839
is that still the case in your

999
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,440
experience

1000
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,359
my microphone still working you can hear

1001
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,540
me

1002
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,660
just look at look look at the Circle C

1003
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,359
is a standard and what it does because

1004
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,520
in the canvas you have just eight bytes

1005
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,339
in Canada you have 64 bytes but it

1006
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,300
generates the the max the message

1007
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,920
authentication code with the right

1008
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,119
algorithm

1009
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,940
but then it just cut the hash

1010
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,560
I think you know that if I had the

1011
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,980
consequences and uh the another thing

1012
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,680
you know that that you you are right so

1013
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,319
the the

1014
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,119
the

1015
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,060
cast in the past doesn't have the

1016
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,040
necessary processing power to handle

1017
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,339
cryptography but nowadays the high-end

1018
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,640
uh CPUs and mcus

1019
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,880
they already started to get the ehsm

1020
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,040
and they are getting more and more

1021
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,220
powerful so sooner or later this will be

1022
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,500
solved of course the cryptography is

1023
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,480
hard so it won't be solved but they will

1024
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,440
try

1025
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,980
and it's really good okay thanks yeah

1026
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,640
thank you for the question again

1027
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,240
thank you both very much
