1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,639
cyber security

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,279
cannot ignore climate change so sit back

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,759
and enjoy

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,580
hi everyone my name is Chloe Mustang and

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,780
today we're going to talk about cyber

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,820
security cannot ignore climate change

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,100
and this is going to be a very quick

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,199
talk and we're going to really focus and

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,539
dive into why we are even talking about

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,140
this in the first place so let's do this

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,480
for those that don't know who I am my

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,279
name is Chloe mastagi and I'm the

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,660
founder and principal of impactive

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,760
Consulting and what I do is I help

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,280
organizations and security teams become

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,100
more you know trustworthy I'll say help

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,500
mitigate risk and drive purpose so

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,780
basically what I do is I'm a strategist

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,539
I help companies grow and to really

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,980
figure out what are the things that are

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,660
holding them back from growing and that

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,219
includes also how do you help your

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,320
security teams and how do you do better

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,480
practices on secure teams to make sure

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
that you're retaining them but also they

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,680
feel empowered and they feel like you're

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,899
investing in them which is needed I'm

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,700
also the co-founder of we open Tech and

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,799
also the co-founder of open Tech pledge

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,619
a podcaster for itsp magazines a change

31
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,960
making podcast and yes I have a book

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
coming out with Wiley that will also

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,979
touch on this subject that we're going

34
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,280
into today so let's get into the details

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,159
let's talk about our planet status so

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,119
overall

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,540
this is going to be Grim but at least we

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,880
know the information to be able to make

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,280
change but what you should know is that

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,500
sea levels are rising and oceans are

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,079
becoming warmer and also we're having

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,020
longer and more intense droughts that

43
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,939
are threatening crops Wildlife fresh

44
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,700
water supplies you know from those polar

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,340
bears that we always see in our head and

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,500
when we see it we get a little bit sad

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,820
if

48
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,880
it's hard right you also had the rain

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
turtles that are off the coast of Africa

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,579
overall our planet's diversity of life

51
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,979
is at risk because of the changing

52
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,280
climate at this time

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,439
and at this time we are looking at one

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,800
third of all plant and animal species to

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,459
be extinct in 50 years this was a study

56
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,220
that was done by pnas go check it out

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,620
but it is a one of those things that

58
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,480
when you read it and you see it and you

59
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,640
see on the screen it does impact you a

60
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,319
little bit

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,540
but overall the Australian Think Tank

62
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,660
IEP also predicts that at least 1.2

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,300
billion people could be displaced by

64
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,900
such climate related events by 2050 and

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,400
we have plenty of these evidence as

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,620
we've seen over the year uh such what

67
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,319
happened in Germany and the flooding we

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,660
also have seen that when it comes to the

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,300
droughts the high heat that we

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,640
experience across Europe and in the U.S

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,220
even in Canada

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,340
but we have also seen what could also

73
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,920
happen when displacement is going to

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
occur so for example you know the

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,160
majority of 30.7 million people were

76
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,560
actually displaced in 2020 alone and

77
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,239
this was due to fleeing from floods

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,599
Wildfire drought or heat waves but also

79
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,879
this was a report that was released by

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
The International Federation of Red

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,500
Cross and the Red Cross I mean the red

82
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,180
crescent societies

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,860
and this image that you're seeing was

84
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,379
taken in 2017 what about a third of

85
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,599
Bangladesh itself was underwater due to

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
flood's Devastation which actually

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
forced people to relocate and become

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,080
climate refugees

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,980
in Bangladesh alone is predicted that 17

90
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,040
of the country will be submerged by the

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,159
rise of sea level by 2050. that means

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,459
about 20 million people living there

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,720
will lose their homes

94
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,080
and today many people in developing

95
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,239
countries are suffering from droughts

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,760
windstorms on a scale never seen before

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,519
depriving them of their daily food and

98
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,640
basic needs the term climate refugees

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,099
was first coined to describe the

100
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,599
increasing large-scale migration and

101
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,159
cross-border mass movements of people

102
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,440
that were partly caused by such

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,660
weather-related disasters in the U.S we

104
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,459
saw that but people from Central America

105
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,639
trying to cross the border because of

106
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,840
the drought situation

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,300
and of course we also have buyers y'all

108
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,380
remember the the fires across California

109
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,300
possibly I mean I learned California I

110
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,280
remember the day when I opened my blinds

111
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,919
and I saw that everything was orange

112
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,759
around me I felt like as if I walked on

113
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,300
mars it was incredibly

114
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,120
surreal and also very very scary

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,639
and in the US right now and around the

116
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,400
world we're experiencing drought in

117
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,120
several different places

118
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,940
and over the past 20 years at this time

119
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,160
the researchers found that a one degree

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,259
Celsius which is about 1.8 degrees

121
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,020
Fahrenheit increases in mean summer

122
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,720
temperature increases the risk of fire

123
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
starting on any given day either by

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
human activity or lightning strike by 19

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
to 22 percent and has now increased that

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,120
burn area by 22 to 25 percent

127
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,440
and it's not just that we have to worry

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,259
about when it comes to fires analysis of

129
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,000
satellite imagery from the past four

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
decades has suggested that global

131
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,919
warming has increases the chance of

132
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,100
storms reaching Category 3 or higher as

133
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,259
we've seen recently with hurricane Ian

134
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,880
hitting Florida and other areas

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,940
and melting glaciers add to that rice

136
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,820
and sea level and which in return

137
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,060
increases that Coastal erosion and

138
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,539
elevates Storm surges as that warming

139
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,120
air and ocean temperatures create more

140
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,940
frequent and intense Coastal storms like

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,759
hurricanes and typhoons

142
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,960
and from data from NASA's Grace Project

143
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,600
we've also been able to track Antarctica

144
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,919
the mass

145
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,340
but overall in Greenland and Antarctic

146
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,440
Ice Sheets are losing significant

147
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,940
amounts of land-based ice as a result of

148
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,840
human-caused global warming

149
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,900
and now let's go into deeper about

150
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,840
what's going on in our Waters so at

151
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,360
least 14 million tons of plastic ends up

152
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,120
in our ocean every year and plastic

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
makes up about 80 percent of the Marine

154
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,100
debris found from surface water so deep

155
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,860
sea sediments marine species actually

156
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,500
ingest this or get entangled by plastic

157
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,199
debris which causes severe injuries and

158
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,660
death but you're also eating it too if

159
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,220
you eat fish

160
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,380
so that's good for you you're basically

161
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,280
eating a plastic amount on a weekly

162
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,460
basis of a form of the same amount as

163
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,500
your credit card so you know you have

164
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,720
credit cards or debit card yeah you're

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,020
digesting about one of those per week at

166
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,520
this time

167
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,000
lots of fun right it's in your water too

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
and if you're not aware of like the

169
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,500
Great Pacific Garbage Patch it is part

170
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,259
of a five offshore plastic accumulation

171
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,900
zones in the world's oceans and is

172
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,940
located halfway between Hawaii and

173
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,160
California it covers their approximately

174
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,860
surface of 1.6 million square kilometers

175
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,080
an area that's twice the size of Texas

176
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,479
and if you don't know about Texas and

177
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,099
state and how big it is how about this

178
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,500
way think about France

179
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,819
now imagine three of France's in one

180
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,759
place yeah that's basically it's pretty

181
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,120
massive it's estimated that it's between

182
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,660
1.15 million to 2.41 million tons of

183
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,419
plastic they're entering our ocean each

184
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,620
year from Rivers

185
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,800
and for those that aren't aware

186
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,099
fun fact not really fun fact but it

187
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,680
takes about 400 to A Thousand Years for

188
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,259
plastic to decompose

189
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,660
and that's an estimation we actually

190
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,479
don't we've never seen it decompose

191
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,240
naturally on its own for human existence

192
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,458
because plastic hasn't been around for

193
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,620
that long nor has research on this

194
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,839
subject been around for so many years to

195
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,760
be able to track it so this is an

196
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,339
estimation and some say that it actually

197
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,659
could take more than a thousand years

198
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,060
and this is just like the most minimum

199
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,480
way of figuring out how many years it

200
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
will take for plastic to decompose

201
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,220
and about things to note is about 66

202
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,779
discarded paper and cardboard is usually

203
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,920
recycled 27 is glass eight percent are

204
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
Plastics that are actually recycled the

205
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
reality is that we don't really know how

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,300
to recycle plastic around the world so

207
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,040
Glass and Metal can be recycled

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,320
indefinitely paper can be recycled about

209
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
five to seven times before it's degraded

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,420
to what would be made into new paper for

211
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,880
example but plus it can only be recycled

212
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,880
maybe once or twice and especially if

213
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,440
there's food in the container it will

214
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,959
not be processed at all because the

215
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,540
polymers break down in the recycling

216
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,439
process

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,660
and now we're going to get into the bit

218
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,060
about your health and how climate change

219
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,100
plays a role

220
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,800
now the thing to note about then the

221
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,380
root causes of climate change is that it

222
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,959
also are the reasons of why we're going

223
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,160
to see more increases of pandemic risks

224
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,200
one of the contributing factors for such

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,420
things is deforestation which occurs

226
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,300
mostly for agricultural purposes is the

227
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,320
largest cause of habitat loss worldwide

228
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,540
loss of habitat forces animals to

229
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,760
migrate and potentially kind of contact

230
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,820
other animals or people and then they

231
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,920
share germs and then you have large

232
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,500
livestock Farms can also serve as a

233
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,080
source for spillover of infections from

234
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,860
animals to people if for example

235
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,320
preventing deforestation that root cause

236
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,380
of climate change can help stem

237
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,779
biodiversity loss as well as slow that

238
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,940
animal migrations that can increase that

239
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,420
risk of infection disease and spread so

240
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,580
having a less demand for animal meat

241
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,440
because most of the deforestation is

242
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,680
also happening for the purposes of you

243
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,459
know having cattle on land but also one

244
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,079
thing to note is that having a more

245
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,079
sustainable animal like has boundary I

246
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,339
think that's how you pronounce the word

247
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,040
could actually decrease the emerging

248
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,079
infectious disease risk and lower

249
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,420
greenhouse gas emissions and for those

250
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,860
that don't know what makes up your

251
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,220
Greenhouse emissions it is carbon

252
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,440
dioxide

253
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,500
methane nitrous oxide and fluorinated

254
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,620
gases so that's four things

255
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,860
that make up grass greenhouse gas

256
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,600
emissions and you may actually see it

257
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,640
also as ghg by the way

258
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,899
and one of the things of example of

259
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,380
where we're seeing this besides covid-19

260
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,720
is that the recent Ebola epidemic in

261
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,779
West Africa probably occurred because of

262
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,019
bats which carried the disease that were

263
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,720
forced to move into new habitats because

264
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,940
the forests that they used to live in

265
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,279
have been cut down to grow palm oil

266
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,940
trees and this has been researched

267
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,839
significantly claiming that it was the

268
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,140
theories that have caused more and more

269
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,620
patients to have Ebola because of the

270
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,820
move of bats

271
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,160
now the future risks are not easy to

272
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,620
foretell because these are all basically

273
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,420
based on research and patterns that

274
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
we've been seeing over the years but the

275
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,120
reality is that climate change hits hard

276
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
on so many different fronts that matter

277
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,940
to when where pathogens appear including

278
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,760
temperature rainfall patterns but to

279
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,000
also it it helps to limit the risk of

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,959
infectious diseases when we do reduce

281
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,700
greenhouse gas emissions and make sure

282
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,560
that we limit global warming to 1.5

283
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,880
degrees

284
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,180
however getting that to happen at this

285
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,640
time where we are right now seems almost

286
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
impossible

287
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,519
humans and wild animals face so many

288
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
challenges for survival because of

289
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,300
climate change and more frequent you

290
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,700
know an intense drought storms heat

291
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,160
waves rising sea levels melting glaciers

292
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,459
warming oceans can absolutely directly

293
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,620
impact us

294
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,100
animals as well where we live it's going

295
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,620
to cause and wreak havoc on people's

296
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,920
livelihoods and communities

297
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,099
foreign

298
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,459
but it's not a good place for the us but

299
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,500
the world just in general isn't a

300
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,019
problem situation but overall what I

301
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,639
want to point out from all that slides

302
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,620
is to point out that climate change is

303
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,740
real and you may be like asking why I

304
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,380
know that it is real cool I'm glad that

305
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,260
you do and that you you know it the

306
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,639
problem is there are people in our

307
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,040
industry that still doubt that climate

308
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,339
change exists and that's where we have

309
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,459
an issue but before we do go into that

310
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,079
there's still more some details you

311
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,300
should note so

312
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,940
at this point we're currently heading

313
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,399
towards at least a three degree celsius

314
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,519
change and globally we are assuming that

315
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,040
we will at least hit 2 degrees Celsius

316
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,519
at this very point

317
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,700
and yes we do have you know the Paris

318
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,279
agreement which clearly defines that two

319
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,260
degrees Celsius as the upper limit for

320
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,779
global warming but also lists 1.5

321
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,600
Celsius as a more desirable goal because

322
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,420
it reduces the risk of the worst

323
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,240
outcomes for climate change but I want

324
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,200
to reiterate that we are on track to go

325
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,519
beyond 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. we are

326
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,160
looking at three degrees and more if we

327
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,860
do not make any changes right now

328
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,899
and if you're wondering what would the

329
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,300
difference look like Chloe well you got

330
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,339
heat waves fresh water heavy rainfall

331
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,519
prop yields sea level rise Coral

332
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,320
bleaching and you might be like well

333
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,720
that's not too bad right

334
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,100
sure I guess but we're not at 1.5 right

335
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,040
now but we're about to be

336
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,959
and here's another way of looking at

337
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,019
this you can look at the loss of plants

338
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,899
loss of you know insect species I know

339
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,240
you hate bees but we need bees to

340
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,300
survive so we don't want to lose bees

341
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,360
here but also coral reefs

342
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,160
um getting bleach is a terrible

343
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,920
situation for our you know the life

344
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,860
under our Waters but that extreme heat

345
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,339
means that we will not be secure with

346
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,860
food that also means we won't be secure

347
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,120
with water

348
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,060
so if we can't have food and water and

349
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,880
we don't have the ability to produce

350
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,779
energy that is effective and clean then

351
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,480
we're going to have issues

352
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,880
the collective Global goal under that

353
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,100
Paris climate agreement is to prevent

354
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,839
the rising global temperatures from

355
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,339
increasing to no more than two degrees

356
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,720
Celsius

357
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,060
but no more than 1.5 degrees that's

358
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,120
ideal but currently like I said we are

359
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,760
on track for almost Beyond doubling that

360
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,519
a potential catastrophic of Three

361
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,820
Degrees

362
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,860
so one way how you can look into this if

363
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,040
you don't believe me because I am not a

364
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,980
climate expert I will be honest my

365
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,620
background is being a strategist and

366
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,920
also infosec but I am very much

367
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,660
committed to wanting to make a

368
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,860
difference when it comes to climate

369
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,120
change hence why I'm giving this talk

370
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,980
but if you want to double check anything

371
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,380
please take a look at the admissions Gap

372
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,699
report

373
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,139
um there was one that was just came out

374
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,959
most likely this year however I have not

375
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,980
read it so I have read the 2021 one and

376
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,100
that one it basically showcased that you

377
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,000
know

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,759
with our pledges will probably result a

379
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,060
warming of around 2.7 degrees Celsius at

380
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,320
this time

381
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,320
so if implemented effectively you know

382
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,480
Net Zero emission pledges could limit to

383
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,480
a warming of 2.2 degrees Celsius closer

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,139
to the well-being of you know that two

385
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,759
degrees Celsius goal of the Paris

386
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,660
agreement

387
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,060
but that means we need significant

388
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,220
changes within the next few years and

389
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,980
continuously and so this report's really

390
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,079
good to understand what is needed at

391
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,380
this time

392
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,020
now when I brought up that whole climate

393
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,419
change is Real This the truth that I've

394
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,220
shared with you these are all backed up

395
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,959
with facts

396
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,540
um from leading institutions on climate

397
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,939
change but also you know the research

398
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,460
institutions that are doing the work and

399
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,760
the hard work of tracking everything

400
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,280
but the reality is that

401
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,860
why am I bringing this up at an infosec

402
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,740
conference well first thank you activity

403
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,260
for accepting this talk about climate

404
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,720
change it is a controversial talk in

405
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,160
many other places around the world

406
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,580
including in the US a lot unfortunately

407
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,520
but the reality is that we don't talk

408
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,380
about climate change because of the

409
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,780
political situation

410
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,900
and it's one of those things that if we

411
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,059
are always talking about risks and

412
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,820
mitigating risk security risks and all

413
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,620
this stuff and yet we never bring up

414
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,320
climate change in those meetings

415
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
that concerns me and as you're concerned

416
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
you

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,860
in other words we have Executives who

418
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,360
aren't doing anything or even

419
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,700
considering the impact of climate change

420
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
at this very moment so many decision

421
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,160
makers hush the subject and deny the

422
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,440
science which then leaves you with a

423
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,799
record when there is a flooding

424
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,860
situation or when we have incredible

425
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,799
fires or we have climate Refugee

426
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,679
situations happening at companies we are

427
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,900
not prepared for that because our

428
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,760
employers are not prepared for it

429
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,820
because they're not talking about it

430
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,460
and as a security team we need to talk

431
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,140
about that right

432
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,000
and one thing I want to point out is

433
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,700
that the industry that we're in uses a

434
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,559
lot of electricity including for

435
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,919
computer data centers if much of that

436
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,620
comes from coal to be honest it creates

437
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,020
this boatload of Planet warming

438
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,179
emissions this is relatively an easy

439
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,039
problem to solve if companies use

440
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,740
renewable energy which is expanding fast

441
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,260
and getting cheaper I would tell you

442
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,480
that Amazon Google and Microsoft have

443
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,160
also gotten attention for selling

444
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,500
technology to help the oil gas industry

445
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,840
extract fossil fuels which are a major

446
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,940
source of greenhouse gas emissions

447
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,980
however Google has promised to stop

448
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,539
doing this believe it or not

449
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,520
the next thing to note is that it is

450
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,600
possible for big tech companies you know

451
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,539
to help achieve that zero emissions

452
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,000
it is possible to do that but we need

453
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,340
them to be with us

454
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,080
what's happening is that we see a lot of

455
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,539
tech companies actually preventing any

456
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,220
change when it comes to climate change

457
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,419
because they're worried that it will

458
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,500
impact their business in a negative way

459
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,020
so because of that then this is becoming

460
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,179
an issue like when we try to have

461
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,520
emission standards we're going to have

462
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,840
ROBLOX both the UK and the EU now

463
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,460
actually require their countries to

464
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,880
achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and

465
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,740
that's bound to affect Tech in every

466
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,720
other industry because of these

467
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,220
countries that are moving forward or

468
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,559
these unions that are moving forward to

469
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,500
ensure that this is going to happen

470
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,140
now the reason I'm saying we aren't

471
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,820
prepared for climate change impacting

472
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,520
cyber security is also because what that

473
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,320
means is we're going to have to start

474
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,000
stepping up to protecting natural

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,980
resources such as water from attackers

476
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,559
that means this is a supply chain

477
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,100
situation so climate change provides us

478
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,460
with plenty of risks and security issues

479
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,039
in our supply chain because of climate

480
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,960
change and what it can do

481
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,360
the shift of employees moving across the

482
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,059
country and the world also does play a

483
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,919
role I don't know if you remember but

484
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,100
during the pandemic all the silly

485
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,620
working remotely was a little bit

486
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,960
difficult for some security team so yeah

487
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,240
it's something we have to work on but

488
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,980
also the increase of weather damages

489
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,500
does impact businesses and also your

490
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,440
data is being stored but also increasing

491
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,260
pandemics also impacts businesses and

492
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,860
creates security risks as well

493
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,480
and most importantly in my opinion

494
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,720
additionally is that how do we protect

495
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,419
Aid that's being delivered in areas that

496
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,340
need it the most because of climate

497
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,740
change because attackers may try going

498
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,280
after it such as funds or food or even

499
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,000
like survival blankets water there's a

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,340
lot of different things so

501
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,380
the thing is

502
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,080
we need a plan and we must plan and we

503
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,120
can do that so don't think of this as

504
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,240
Doom and Gloom situation we absolutely

505
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
have the ability to make a difference in

506
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,820
our company and on our security team and

507
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,980
our participation in the infosec

508
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,179
community

509
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:03,960
foreign

510
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,520
so I'm going to give you some

511
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,140
suggestions to prepare for the future

512
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,360
and I want to give a quick random fact

513
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
but for those that don't know about

514
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,799
carbon dioxide did you know that it can

515
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,080
last about 1 000 years in the atmosphere

516
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
if anything they think it can leak at

517
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
last for at least 1 000 years but once

518
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,700
again we don't have the data back up

519
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,659
that if it can go even longer than 1 000

520
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,460
years so keep that in mind

521
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,600
now the first thing you could do is

522
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
spread awareness of climate change let

523
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
people know it's real it's going to

524
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,720
impact us it's already impacting us I

525
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,220
don't know a single person where climate

526
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,200
change has not impacted their daily life

527
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,900
at this time

528
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,940
but one of the things you can do is to

529
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,980
get your company to start using ESG

530
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,299
Frameworks and create annual

531
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,100
sustainability reports and I'm not

532
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,900
talking about doing some green washing

533
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,059
reports here because that's not okay

534
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,700
that's never okay but there are some

535
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,640
that you can look into so the tcfd I

536
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,799
really like because what it does is that

537
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,039
it gets the board and also the

538
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,320
leadership teams to think about what

539
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,840
would happen to the business if we got

540
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,140
two degrees Celsius warmer now what

541
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,600
about three degrees Celsius warmer four

542
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,640
degrees Celsius warmer how will that

543
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,100
impact our operations our security teams

544
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,039
and our personnel and also how we run

545
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,620
our business so by practicing these type

546
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,200
of exercises and coming up with you know

547
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,440
incident response plans I see what I did

548
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,220
there

549
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,340
um that actually can help companies be

550
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,400
able to be prepared for things such as

551
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,900
you know

552
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,299
anything that climate change throws our

553
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,520
way in the future

554
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,659
um there are some other ones to look

555
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,780
into to go for also knowing your carbon

556
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,520
footprint believe it or not is

557
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,340
incredibly easy to note what your carbon

558
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,200
footprint is it is the one thing you can

559
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,299
calculate with the ESG standards and

560
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,419
Frameworks that is incredibly easier to

561
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,760
do than any of the other things knowing

562
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,740
your carbon footprint is easy to track

563
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,539
and to note

564
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,120
um you can use that

565
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
footprintcalculator.org for individuals

566
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,500
for companies there's the ghg

567
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,960
protocol.org one and they have this ghg

568
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,539
emissions calculation tool that got uh

569
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,260
released earlier this year

570
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,520
but knowing your waist is incredibly

571
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,679
important because you can note that

572
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,419
plastic you want to just reduce it just

573
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,580
overall don't assume it can be reusable

574
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,679
recyclable don't ever do that instead

575
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,720
keep reusing that same plastic item

576
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
multiple times until it breaks down in

577
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
that same with a plastic bag if you have

578
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
one use it multiple times they'll throw

579
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
it away just keep using it over and over

580
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,700
compost if you can go trash free it's a

581
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,900
little bit controversial you can't

582
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,880
technically go trash free but use

583
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,419
reusable containers and bags that could

584
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,299
be helpful snacks in bulk so instead of

585
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,400
getting individual packets and your bulk

586
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,679
items get something in like one enormous

587
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,500
bag with all your products in it also

588
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,539
recycle glass and paper products because

589
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,299
those things can be recycled always just

590
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,340
make sure you rinse it out properly if

591
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,460
you're using glass and also tin

592
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,840
um also buy less Believe It or Not by

593
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,460
buying less you're actually saving the

594
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,580
planet

595
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,900
um rethink conferences so one thing to

596
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,120
talk about is when we have conferences

597
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,919
to always have a hybrid version like

598
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,320
right now we have a hybrid version I

599
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,820
wish I could be there in person I'll be

600
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,380
honest

601
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,200
um but hybrid versions do help in many

602
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,400
ways because it can reduce

603
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,620
transportation to the conference and

604
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,840
away from the conference uh ghg

605
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,480
admissions in the US it's like that

606
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,980
highest contributing factor is

607
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,380
transportation often on your CO2

608
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,700
emissions when you're making decisions

609
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,279
when planning your conferences knowing

610
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,440
what how much it's going to cost the

611
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,900
environment by doing it and how you can

612
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,179
start limiting those things

613
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,760
also your food and energy source that's

614
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,500
important I like to bring up energy

615
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,659
source for people to know is like you

616
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,299
can drive a Tesla but if your Tesla is

617
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,179
being powered by energy that comes from

618
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,279
coal you're not doing anything good for

619
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,279
the environment by driving that Tesla so

620
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,179
always

621
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,460
be aware of warrior energy source where

622
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,240
is it coming from

623
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,760
I would dive into this part but one

624
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,940
thing quickly on here is that t-shirts

625
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,860
at conferences let's talk about it

626
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,960
really quickly most of the time there

627
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,820
are plastic fibers in there such as

628
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,240
Raylon and many other things but

629
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,340
remember it takes about 400 plus years

630
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,380
to decompose the majority of your

631
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,360
t-shirts that if you wear once or twice

632
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,980
that from this you know when you got

633
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,740
swag get thrown into the trash even if

634
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,020
you do donate chances are it's gonna end

635
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,179
up in a land waste because most of the

636
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,100
time those items aren't reused again

637
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,799
they're actually sold or they're dumped

638
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,159
into areas in developing places or

639
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,039
illegal places and if you don't believe

640
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,580
me let me show you why if you don't know

641
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,940
about this take a look at it look into

642
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,080
Chile and how all our clothes that you

643
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,840
donate not all of them but good chunk of

644
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,880
them or retailers that don't sell it

645
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,539
they send their stuff over to Chile and

646
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,480
it gets dumped in here about more than

647
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,179
half of 60 000 tons of clothes imported

648
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,159
each year ends up in illegal desert

649
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,500
landfills with dire consequences for the

650
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,760
environment and the local communities

651
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,760
like we're seeing right here

652
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,480
okay

653
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,940
but overall what you can do is buy less

654
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,580
Tech invest in your devices hold on to

655
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,100
them as long as you can if it's not

656
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,980
broken keep it if they don't have any

657
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,020
more updates on it then maybe it's time

658
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,580
to look elsewhere because we are in

659
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,840
security and we like to have Safe

660
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,299
products so if there's ever that then

661
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,980
that's the time when you would go about

662
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,159
it but you know making sure that we

663
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,220
really kind of go after copyright laws

664
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,380
to ensure that we can repair the devices

665
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,260
ourselves would be incredibly helpful

666
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,919
and beneficial to our environment so we

667
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,539
don't have to keep replacing it whenever

668
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,520
something is broken

669
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,080
um but most importantly I just want to

670
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,640
point out there that most of the tech

671
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,100
that we buy does have rare materials and

672
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,960
those rare materials are usually adults

673
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,299
and children that are mining and it's

674
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,460
modern day slavery in many places around

675
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,620
the world so it is one of those things

676
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,539
that every time you buy some equipment

677
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,940
you do not know basically the supply

678
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,760
chain of how it ended up in your hand so

679
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,740
always be careful if you cannot know

680
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,860
what those things are assume possibly

681
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,820
the worst at times so recycle programs

682
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,279
don't really exist on here so whatever

683
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,520
you do by make sure that it lasts long

684
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,640
invest in it and just keep it as long as

685
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,080
you can instead of replacing it

686
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,600
and last but not least here are all the

687
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,039
things you can do to get involved at

688
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,900
this time so know your waist get your

689
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,340
companies on board with the ESG

690
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,779
standards or at least start that

691
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,299
conversation track your carbon footprint

692
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,580
ensure events produce low emissions and

693
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,039
trash volunteer and help protect our

694
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,900
resources because there will be

695
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,000
attackers out there and this already has

696
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,559
been happening

697
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,260
um them going after electricity water

698
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,299
food and all that in different places

699
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,640
around the world so we need to step up

700
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,980
and protect our supply chain

701
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,559
also knowing to purchase less is the

702
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,880
best thing you can do for the

703
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,980
environment just that and alone and

704
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,380
