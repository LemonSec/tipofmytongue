1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,500
hi it's Mr Ali Abdullahi

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,500
thank you so much uh welcome ladies and

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,580
gentlemen

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,480
so today I'm gonna talking about the

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,299
metaverse not really about the matters

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,699
metaverse itself just gonna take a look

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,260
at the other side of metaverse

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,400
deployments

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,960
they

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,880
in place components and their

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,859
connectivities

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,019
because as far as you know now we have

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
different type of metaverse deployments

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,340
we have different vendors different

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,140
companies they have their own deployment

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,300
of metaverse but we are hearing too many

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
times since last two years about the

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,739
metaverse and different vendors

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,960
companies started to deploy their own

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,579
metaverse systems

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,940
and environments so

22
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,180
uh yeah

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,660
okay A bit about myself so I'm Ali I'm

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,000
uh security engineer at picnic

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,059
Technologies Netherlands so

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:03,899
um

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,560
security researcher for a decade and I'm

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,600
regularly participating as a speaker

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,180
trainer in different conferences across

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,380
the world

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,520
and I just want to

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,979
go a bit faster

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,960
too many slides so

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
let's talk about the agenda of this

35
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,080
presentation

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,180
so first of all we will take a look at

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,979
the metaverse itself different

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,759
components different layers and

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,420
connectivities and different

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,939
Technologies in use within the metaverse

41
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,820
deployments and after that we will try

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,159
to identify different security risks and

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,200
threats

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,540
and uh also this presentation is just

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,759
the starting points right now there are

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,040
too many security researchers around the

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,659
world that are working on metaverse

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,920
they're working on this kind of

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,460
Technologies nowadays and uh yeah

50
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,619
hopefully we can see more and more

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,979
research and papers around this kind of

52
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,259
Technologies and also do not expect to

53
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,560
cover all the things they are just a

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,139
couple of items that we are going to

55
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,319
talk about today and yeah let's get

56
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,580
started

57
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,819
so what actually made of Our Stars so

58
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,340
we heard that metaverse is gonna bring

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,840
gingo real life into digital one and uh

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,319
like we can do video games

61
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,720
entertainments we can do like a social

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,540
networking and remote working as well as

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,099
a like a investment as well and uh here

64
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,200
you can see the different components and

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,060
items within the metaverse like the

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,540
virtual reality mixed reality augmented

67
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,500
reality extended reality nfts and

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,780
digital assets crypto as well as web

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,660
free which is a very big part of that

70
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,180
and uh it's a separated topic if you

71
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,780
want to talk about

72
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,560
so what is the uh main metaverse impact

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,620
is actually the main impact is only on

74
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,840
our daily life you know real life

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,379
actually and uh also another impact is

76
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,220
on our daily work and as well as doing

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,920
education is possible as well throughout

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,200
the metaverse entertainment as well

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,340
which is a very very big item here uh

80
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,620
media and also investment and also I

81
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,800
hear like some sort of Ceremonies inside

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,340
metaverse as well as the wedding party

83
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,260
throughout metaverse etc etc

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,220
but it's still a black box so we don't

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,099
know much more about the the metaverse

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,440
itself so we just want to more about it

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,540
because we we are hearing different

88
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,459
definitions of metaverse from different

89
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,200
companies different deployments and

90
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,720
vendors around the world but it's still

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
a black box

92
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,860
even for me

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,019
okay uh

94
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,200
let's talk about a tangible example of a

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,560
simple architecture so we have different

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,900
layers here so starting with the basic

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,900
layer which is a uh including the

98
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,040
mathematical function SEC P 365k1 which

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,060
is the BTC uh public key serialization

100
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,160
as well we have core layer which is

101
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,740
responsible for algorithms hashing

102
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,400
databases networking as well model layer

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,020
containing the account credentials

104
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,060
Ledger addresses account addresses etc

105
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,940
etc and we have service layer including

106
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,699
the HTTP connections queries as well as

107
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,240
the subscription models and this is the

108
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,699
age level of the architecture which is

109
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,979
uh connected directly to the human

110
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,199
interface and in human interfaces we

111
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,600
have a different mediums like a mobile

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,740
applications web application etc etc

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,960
so right now we just want to starting

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
with the basic layer so

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,360
I said that we have a like a different

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,419
functions C C plus plus base functions

117
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,460
General functions and mathematical

118
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,340
libraries and uh if I want to mention

119
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,100
some some of the threats here we we can

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,259
like mentioning a freeze attack against

121
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,280
uh uh SEC p2c through 65 and uh buffer

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
overflow vulnerabilities brute forcing

123
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,900
against the mathematical function as

124
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,199
well as reverse engineering and uh yeah

125
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,380
I also just mentioned some CVS here as

126
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,460
well

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,380
so core layer

128
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,900
we have networking networking protocol

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,539
we have proof of work here and also we

130
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,419
are seeing the databases like sqlite

131
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,160
like level DB and the other uh also

132
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,560
threads like if I want to say well the

133
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,780
thirds in this layer it's a Erebus

134
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,240
attack Eclipse attack or CyberLink

135
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
attack which is some sort of node

136
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,139
isolation as well as a denial of service

137
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,180
attack against the networking part I

138
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,860
would say that IP backbone

139
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,639
infrastructure

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,160
so a bit in depth in the previous slide

141
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,380
like about talking about the Cyber

142
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,500
attack which is a like a it will lead to

143
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,440
this double spending and it's trying to

144
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,759
infecting uh honest communities uh and

145
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,300
also uh to to to be able to perform

146
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,120
falsifying uh files like a falsifying

147
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,360
digital files and also aerobus is uh

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,080
also the same but uh targeting uh

149
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,419
internet service providers and the isps

150
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,060
hosting and providing services to public

151
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,860
Bitcoin nodes

152
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,520
and eclipse is also uh it's some sort of

153
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,639
redirection attack and uh trying to

154
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,819
redirect victim connections to other

155
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,060
compromised other already compromised uh

156
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,860
nodes which which are infected

157
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,520
service layer so we have a blockchain

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,100
core notes Here we have HTTP connections

159
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,060
here as well as a client side so

160
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,699
you can see that we have a core notes we

161
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,680
have a connectivity between cover nodes

162
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,259
and HTTP server and the connection

163
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,900
between HTTP and client and in between

164
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,780
we have apis we have websocket we have

165
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,960
Json RPC etc etc and the threads could

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,500
be like a remote code execution URL URI

167
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,800
injection uh API vulnerabilities like

168
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,199
the sensitive

169
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,840
sensitive data disclosure and uh through

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,020
the apis and web sockets uh

171
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,060
vulnerabilities like a sniffing

172
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,440
injection and uh also some maybe some

173
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,020
specific vulnerabilities regarding the

174
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,280
specific Technologies like a 0mq here uh

175
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,259
which is some sort of a messaging

176
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,520
Library

177
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,280
and

178
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,919
so the the other part and which is a

179
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,900
very very critical is communication and

180
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,080
the connectivity so we just want to use

181
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,880
metaverse we just want to use this kind

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,120
of technology so the main part of the

183
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,860
usage of the technology is the

184
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,620
connectivity between my equipment my

185
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,539
device like my mobile phone and uh other

186
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,740
equipments within the core Network

187
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,220
within the service provider so basically

188
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,640
you can see cellular communication like

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,299
a 3G to 6G communication but we are

190
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,760
already dealing with mostly with 4G and

191
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,000
5G communication nowadays and also

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,720
another vital part is a radio part or

193
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,940
radio access networks which is the most

194
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,519
accessible part of this connectivity

195
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,519
because my phone my device is connected

196
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,320
through the radio frequencies within the

197
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,920
cell tower or the base station and what

198
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,160
are the use cases here so basically for

199
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
end-to-end communication for the best

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,380
user experience and best rendering

201
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,180
experience uh Spectrum capacity uh low

202
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,580
latency and also having a better

203
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,940
Handover experience

204
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,459
throughout the radio Access Network

205
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,260
slicing and serious level agreement so

206
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,360
in 5G we have we are dealing with

207
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,760
network slicing and nowadays too many

208
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,860
researchers and universe diversities

209
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,200
institutions they're working on slicing

210
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,760
security as well

211
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,339
and also we were dealing with apis Json

212
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,779
SDK and some other networking platforms

213
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,519
so here is a an overview so

214
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,040
starting from the like for an example

215
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,760
like a extended reality device so we

216
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,980
have a wireless chipset of Wi-Fi chipset

217
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,380
and we have a OS level and Hardware

218
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,779
level and Hardware platform there and

219
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,160
there is a connectivity through the

220
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,839
radio Access Network

221
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,240
towards the core Network

222
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,080
as well as the apis and softwares and

223
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,420
the rest of Technologies in the core

224
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,899
Network so starting from the from the

225
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,720
user points so we can mentioning

226
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
baseband exploitation the exploitation

227
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,160
and vulnerabilities and the baseband

228
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,640
side on a chipset so nowadays we know

229
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,620
that too many zero day vulnerabilities

230
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,200
one day vulnerability is trading and on

231
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,140
dark webs and criminal forums regarding

232
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,839
the exploiting uh different kind of Base

233
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,880
bands with different vendors

234
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,700
so the second item is uh

235
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,160
the OS exploitation remote code

236
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,200
execution and remote jailbreak

237
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,480
exploitation on iOS systems which is

238
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,140
very very interesting here and uh

239
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,240
and the next one is Sim swapping as an

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,000
optional item here I will talk about all

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,700
of those uh in the next slides

242
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,880
so a bit further we have a radio access

243
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,660
part so in this area we can mention the

244
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,880
user equipment information gathering but

245
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,820
for performing man in the middle as well

246
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,600
as deploying a fake uh station or fake

247
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,180
BTS or fake a cell tower

248
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,640
and a bit more in inside the core

249
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,480
Network we can mention that deploying a

250
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,000
rogue node a rock node and a rock

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,339
function inside the core Network or a

252
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,620
fake node I would say denial of service

253
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
and a function and a core function as

254
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,540
well as a denial of service on a user by

255
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,079
making disruption on a normal user

256
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,680
session flow as well as a sniffing

257
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,760
so it's more about the apis because for

258
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,860
example in 5G that I'm going to talk

259
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,279
about it so we are going to deal with

260
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,760
too many apis calls and also HTTP

261
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,700
connection because 5G will open the

262
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
doors new doors to hackers and attackers

263
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,560
around the world because it will be

264
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,779
based on software-defined networking

265
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,200
Network function virtualization and it's

266
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,060
a bit more software rather than secret

267
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,680
switching or radio part

268
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,260
let's talk about OS and software so I

269
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,600
said that remote code execution on

270
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,560
Android devices and remote jailbreak uh

271
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,899
exploitation and iOS systems use after

272
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,600
free vulnerabilities and exploitation

273
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,019
and data extracted extraction even

274
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,800
locally or remotely and also one click

275
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,920
kernel code execution or rje which is a

276
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
part of RJ which is one of the most

277
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,420
valuable zero days nowadays

278
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,279
here's a the radio Access Network

279
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,740
architecture but this one is uh for LTE

280
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,440
part so we have different cell towers

281
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,600
like different enote bees here they're

282
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,839
connected together using the H2

283
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,459
interfaces and also they're connected to

284
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,740
the core Network the left-hand side you

285
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,920
can see the mobile

286
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,540
Mobility management entity which is

287
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,079
responsible for handling the subscribers

288
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,660
uh information as well as a serving

289
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,399
Gateway and packet Gateway they're

290
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,339
acting as a edge router and dealing with

291
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,880
the subscribers data

292
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,639
and let's talk about the radio right now

293
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,240
uh so one of the most important part of

294
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,839
the radio exploitation is the

295
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,959
ability to downgrade uh subscribers in a

296
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,560
specific area to lower Technologies like

297
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,940
if we are using 5G or 4G right now if uh

298
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,540
a criminal or an attacker could be able

299
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,959
to downgrade our cell phone to like a 2g

300
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,220
or 3G Technologies by performing jamming

301
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,760
as you can see here it would be a very

302
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,800
very good environment for them to

303
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,660
perform

304
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,459
Manning the middle attack because there

305
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,279
there is less security mechanisms in 2G

306
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,360
and 3G Networks

307
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:14,160
also nowadays maybe you you are using 5G

308
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,779
we are using 4G LTE and uh in uh next

309
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,180
couple of years we will use a 6G

310
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,420
technology as well but uh mobile network

311
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,940
operators and service providers still

312
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,700
using traditional Technologies they're

313
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,380
still using 2G they're still using 3G so

314
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,380
and the most vulnerable part of the

315
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,779
those traditional Technologies from a

316
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,600
signaling point of view is usage of ss7

317
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,959
networks So within the ss7 networks also

318
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,920
you're able to uh like

319
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,480
extracting the very valuable information

320
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,540
regarding the SIM cards and subscribers

321
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,720
like the rant sris and KC which is

322
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,880
responsible for the confidentiality of

323
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,820
my UCM and the cell tower and if you are

324
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,540
not able to do it in radio access part

325
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,940
it's easy to extract it from the core

326
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,040
Network functions inside the core

327
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,380
Network while taking advantage and

328
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,240
exploiting the traditional Technologies

329
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,660
so here is an example of uh performing a

330
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,540
denial of service and a metaverse user

331
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,720
so for example we can assume that that

332
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,160
user is a XR device or a mixed reality

333
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,940
device Etc and in this example you can

334
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,440
see that the hacker will try to run a

335
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,740
rook and a fake cell tower

336
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,459
to be able to lure the victim lure the

337
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,940
using on that device to pretend that hey

338
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm a legit cell tower and after that

339
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,980
because it's kind of cloning the

340
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,199
configuration of the legit legit SL

341
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,399
Tower here and the traffic area update

342
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,560
which is a necessary part of the

343
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,320
attachment of my device to the cell

344
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,899
tower and to the core Network

345
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,740
will be sent to the illegal cell tower

346
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,560
which is a fake one now and after that

347
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,980
it will respond with the Tau reject to

348
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,260
the user and after that it will cause a

349
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,660
touch reject then I will not be able to

350
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,660
to attach to the network and it will be

351
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,079
inside a loop and uh like a in a

352
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,839
specific area it would because A

353
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
disruption and a denial of service so a

354
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,759
bunch of subscribers a couple of

355
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,000
subscribers in a specific area uh they

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,620
can't attached to the core Network

357
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,300
so I mentioned about uh Sim swapping

358
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,060
actually uh so

359
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,759
it's some sort of account takeover

360
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,860
actually

361
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,560
uh it's a mix of impersonation and

362
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,459
Insider attack so hackers try to like uh

363
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,059
perform a social engineering uh as well

364
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,240
as some initial information gathering on

365
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,720
victims data like the name address etc

366
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,480
etc and it will try to pretend that I'm

367
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,199
gonna changing my seam and the number

368
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,140
the actual msisdn or phone number will

369
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,619
transfer to the illegal and fake SIM

370
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,980
card or a hacker SIM card and after that

371
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,380
uh the hacker will try to perform uh

372
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,440
request the 2fa or uh and after that

373
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,780
unauthorized access to an account and

374
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
account will be compromised and uh

375
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,419
hacker will try to actually gain

376
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,840
unauthorized access to that account

377
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,539
so there are some other radio threads

378
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,740
like a

379
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,780
exploiting the blockchain mutual

380
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,880
authentication or a mass denial of

381
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,419
service by taking advantage of very big

382
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,679
Jammers equipments but it's not really

383
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,600
technical so I'm gonna skip those

384
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,020
and talking a bit about the 5G as well

385
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,620
5G coordinate work which is acting a

386
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,860
vital role in connectivity and

387
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,500
connection of metaverse as well

388
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,460
so as you can see here uh we have a user

389
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,559
equipment yeah I said that there is a

390
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,900
connectivity between user equipment our

391
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,700
cell phone our XR devices etc etc within

392
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,340
the cell tower and these nodes are those

393
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,520
big big equipments Telecom equipments

394
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,100
nowadays but there are mostly software

395
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,919
based and they're virtualized nowadays

396
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,620
and we call them different functions so

397
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,380
we have a user plane function we have a

398
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,360
session management function application

399
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,620
function and what PCF is responsible for

400
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,160
policy charging then also

401
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,980
SMF is responsible for managing the

402
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,400
sessions and also some sort of

403
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,559
of data of different functions different

404
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,600
core functions and uh yeah

405
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,120
so if I want to mention some some sort

406
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
of uh exploitation let's talk about the

407
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,480
denial of service or tampering gonna

408
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,840
murderers Telco infrastructure or user

409
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,039
so to do this uh regardless of usage of

410
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,200
traditional Technologies and only

411
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,980
focusing on 5G core Network So within an

412
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,620
initial access to the network regardless

413
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,140
of Insider hacker or even a remote

414
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,900
access to the one of the core Network

415
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,919
a hacker will try to set up a rogue

416
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,340
function or a rogue SMF here or even

417
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,220
compromising SMF instead of set up a new

418
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,280
one so and we will try to send the HTTP

419
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
2 request containing the network

420
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
function node information like the

421
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,520
function ID and function configuration

422
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,179
to the user plane function

423
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,020
and after that a new rogue node B which

424
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,020
is uh here is SMF we'll try to send the

425
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,780
modification request to modify a

426
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,240
function actually to compromise a

427
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,059
function or even in another scenario it

428
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,280
is possible to send a session deletion

429
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,539
request

430
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:25,799
to UPF to actually delete a legitimate

431
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,160
user session and it will cause a denial

432
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,440
of service and disruption to to the

433
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,140
normal user flow to through through the

434
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,260
network and UPF is responsible for Mike

435
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,320
and uh handling my connection from my

436
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,600
equipment to the network to the public

437
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,799
network like the internet

438
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,080
so another one will be uh the Nyla

439
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,880
series and

440
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,760
infant user and another perspective so

441
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,720
like a user traffic redirection example

442
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,440
here so again we have a rook node uh

443
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,980
here like a SMF and a connection to UPF

444
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,760
and attacker will try to abusing the PF

445
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,799
CPU or packet forward and control

446
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,299
protocol to send the session

447
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,000
modification request to UPF

448
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,120
and changing the destination address and

449
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,400
changing the destination address to

450
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
another address which is a like an

451
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,960
interception point and we have two

452
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,020
different scenarios in case of a null or

453
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,840
invalid destination it will be cause a

454
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,299
denial of service attack and if the

455
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,760
session the node is available and

456
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,039
already compromised by the hacker it

457
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
will be redirecting for the interception

458
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,900
and the sniffing will be possible in

459
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,539
this scenario

460
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,440
so

461
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,799
that's a pretty much of it uh if you

462
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,260
have any questions

463
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,400
uh it will be available

464
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,400
questions anyone

465
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,780
you saw your Valley

466
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,000
thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,300
uh for your time I appreciate it

468
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,389
[Applause]
