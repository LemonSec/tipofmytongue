welcome our next speakers to the stands

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,400
so please welcome back to vanesh and

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,380

00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,550
[Applause]

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,119
thanks hi everyone uh Welcome to our

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,279
presentation

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,660
Automotive three intelligence product

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,560
versus ID cyber security

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,080
my name is Peter Venice I am a threaten

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,420
thousands manager from distant group

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,940
that's by the way are really old picture

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
so sorry for that uh I've been touring

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,820
Europe for the last couple of years as a

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,559
three intelligence person

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,520
and my friend here is

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,280
yeah my pleasure to be with you today my

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,320
name is Jose pizero I'm the VP of Market

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,500
development at Upstream being in the

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,020
Auto industry for more than 20 years

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,020
um although all over the places but

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,480
predominantly in connective vehicle and

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,378
Automotive cyber security

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,080
just to tell you a couple of words about

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
uh our company

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,040
so I work for testing group and this

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,380
will be very important in the later

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,580
stages so as you can see we are a

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,020
manufacturing company and we basically

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,400
manufacture everything that has a

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
connection to Steel so you can see some

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,420
still things on the screen submarines we

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,299
have a submarine Division and of course

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,939
as you might have seen my colleague's

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,060
presentation in the morning we are also

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,439
producing

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,180
car parts

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,939
so you can see ourselves there our

39
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,820
employees so you can see we are a huge

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,880
company and we have partnered with

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,658
Upstream

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,000
yeah and a few words about Upstream so

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,060
Upstream is an Israeli company that was

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,639
established in 2017 in Israel and we do

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,160
cyber security and data management

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,620
tooling but also services in the threat

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,260
intelligence space where we collaborate

48
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,220
with our partner Tusan Krupp as well as

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,080
these days it's really important to have

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,660
vehicle security operations centers so

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,700
we operate also vehicle security

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,420
operations centers for our customers

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,660
and as you can see maybe just a quick so

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,879
um some of our investors are from the

55
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,620
automotive domain

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,260
um we are where automotive industry is

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,360
located in the big three regions and

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
today we have more than 12 million

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,080
connect the vehicle on our platform that

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,879
we're monitor day by day

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm here

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,620
to deliver

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,860
a very important message today

64
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,459
this message is that the automotive

65
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,560
industry doesn't care about past

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,879
Tuesdays

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,340
I can see some frowns

68
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,180
yeah because uh basically this is false

69
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,060
the automotive industry does care about

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,200
patch Tuesdays so uh I have uh brilliant

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,120
colleagues in the I.T space who are

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,120
betting their uh software and our

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,760
software in fact so that everything's up

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,140
to date and everything works

75
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,080
and that's great but I am a product

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,180
cyber security person

77
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,280
so

78
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,180
I don't care about past Tuesdays

79
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,519
and again this is

80
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,920
untrue

81
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,580
we in the automotive industry use a lot

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,379
of software which is open source these

83
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,159
are batch regularly so if we didn't

84
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,620
patch our tools and our tooling used

85
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,099
then uh and production or in the

86
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,700
products then we would be in a very bad

87
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,880
space and we'd have vulnerabilities

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,918
which we wouldn't want

89
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,460
so that's why this is partially false

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,680
while we do care that uh the

91
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,860
infrastructure our development is uh

92
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,979
running on is up to date

93
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,380
my Christmases usually aren't ruined by

94
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,759
uh extreme vulnerabilities like log4j or

95
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,580
the solarwinds vulnerability which was

96
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,040
which happened about two years ago

97
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,259
however

98
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,500
there is one thing I'm really concerned

99
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,340
about

100
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,160
and that's something I don't see in the

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,300
automotive industry uh B it's uh oems so

102
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,840
car manufacturers or suppliers

103
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,919
I'm really concerned that there is

104
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,680
or there are no past Tuesdays in the

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,460
automotive sector you see some

106
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,680
vulnerabilities released for

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,979
um a large American

108
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,979
self-driving cars so there are CVS for

109
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,440
that brand

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,979
but they're it's not common for the

111
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,280
industry to release their

112
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,780
vulnerabilities in a way you can see

113
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,820
that in the I.T space

114
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,120
which from one standpoint makes sense

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,419
because you

116
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,699
you if you would make your

117
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,460
vulnerabilities public that would open a

118
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,340
whole can of worms that would be

119
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,060
um unfortunate for car manufacturers and

120
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,320
uh tier one suppliers such as ourselves

121
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,380
so what we are doing is that we need to

122
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,960
better understand the threat landscape

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,139
so we need to understand who is

124
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,120
targeting us who is targeting the car

125
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,360
makers who is targeting the automotive

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,620
suppliers

127
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,020
and the fact who will Target Us in five

128
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,300
years

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,160
what will be used to Target us what kind

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,139
of uh tools uh protocols and techniques

131
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,900
will be used to Target us

132
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,100
currently

133
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,199
thankfully

134
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
most of the targeting is uh from

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,759
with security researchers and white hat

136
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,220
hackers but Giuseppe will talk about

137
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,160
targeting in a minute

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,740
but what will happen in five years when

139
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,840
there will be smart cities and connected

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,419
ecosystems that's something we need to

141
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,120
work for diligently to be able to

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
predict

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,800
beforehand what will be used to attack

144
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,759
us

145
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,360
however

146
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
there are the cyber security of car

147
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,960
manufacturing is still a new thing I

148
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,580
hope you haven't seen any uh

149
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,860
self-driving cars that have been hacked

150
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,720
on your way here

151
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,380
I haven't so uh that means this is still

152
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,000
not as prevalent

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
as we

154
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,680
assume it to be in the near term

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,139
but if there are rumors

156
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,599
that there's a vulnerability out there

157
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,720
or if there is an attack out there that

158
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,979
could be

159
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,880
as damaging as the vulnerability itself

160
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,699
because people would Panic people want

161
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,639
wouldn't want to sit in their cars and

162
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,039
that would be bad for everyone

163
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,419
so we needed to find a new approach to

164
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,819
find relevant threat intelligence

165
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,500
but first let's talk about threat

166
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,780
intelligence in the automotive sector

167
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,720
it's similar to the it threat

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,740
intelligence

169
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,080
so uh we have our priority

170
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,020
intelligence requirements which for me

171
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,860
number one is to protect and predict

172
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,139
what kind of attacks will impact our

173
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,220
products

174
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,280
my second priority is to protect the

175
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,520
local company and additionally if I find

176
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,419
anything that's useful for the group

177
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,580
then I will act upon it

178
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,919
we work uh according to the Australian

179
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,860
intelligence life cycle

180
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,279
and what research is uh open source

181
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,419
intelligence

182
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,059
human intelligence this could be any of

183
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,940
you so sometimes security researchers

184
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,240
come to me describing a vulnerability

185
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
and sometimes internal colleagues come

186
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,200
to me when they find something which is

187
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
great

188
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,800
and we also

189
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,620
get a closed Source intelligence this

190
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,100
would be if I was a

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,620
if this was five years ago I would say

192
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,160
the deep and dark web but we all know

193
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,680
that the deep and dark web is not so

194
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,120
deep and so dark as it it we believed so

195
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,100
five years ago

196
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,480
however

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,820
there are certain risks coming from the

198
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,120
uh let's call it dark web for Simplicity

199
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
and

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,260
one of the reasons

201
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,959
we partnered with Upstream is to get a

202
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,019
better understanding on uh what kind of

203
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,019
threats are impacting us and what kind

204
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,440
of threats will impact Us in the near

205
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,700
medium or long term

206
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,080
yeah so this brings Upstream into the

207
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
conversation so I don't know how many of

208
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,120
you who are in the Auto industry but if

209
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,440
you are or you happen to come across the

210
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,760
yearly report that we publish you may be

211
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,940
acquainted with the risks that are in

212
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,680
the automotive industry so we do this

213
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,339
every year and 90 pages long and we

214
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,040
discuss and talk what's new what are the

215
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,380
new threats that companies need to care

216
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,260
about and what needs to be addressed in

217
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,240
order to stay resilient

218
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,040
now

219
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
when we look at the things it's not just

220
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,399
for the sake of hacking or the attacks

221
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,100
that we are seeing obviously have a

222
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,920
monetary aspect to it the sentence

223
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,140
follow the money is always true and as

224
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,540
you can see from the slide the Auto

225
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,060
industry is suffering big losses from

226
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,519
Cyber attack now arguably this is

227
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,100
everything cyber

228
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,100
but more and more we are getting into

229
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,260
the main where not only the I.T is

230
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,240
affected but more importantly the

231
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,760
products the services of the customers

232
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,940
so the OM and the supply chain is

233
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,240
affected and to stress that point as you

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,420
can see from the graph

235
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,880
the activities in cyber have been

236
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,940
skyrocketing so there's a 344 percent

237
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,540
increase in cyber incidents over the

238
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,660
last 10 years and it's really

239
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,240
significant so that's why it's important

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,899
to be sensitive be aware of this

241
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,440
scenario and I will elaborate later more

242
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,839
on the specifics of the types of attack

243
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,820
for now maybe Peter you can talk about

244
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,899
why it's important for the other

245
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,660
industry what what use cases yeah thank

246
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,899
you very much so uh I've put a couple of

247
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,180
uh use cases together which might be

248
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,640
important in the medium to long term

249
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,060
uh and that might impact the industry as

250
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,740
a whole so the first risk we expect is a

251
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,380
vehicle as a service use case

252
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,060
so uh you all know there is um

253
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,820
very well-known uh brand of car makers

254
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,980
who have recently

255
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,640
um

256
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,600
created a service where they charge a

257
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,959
set number of money for to enable their

258
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,079
uh seat Heating

259
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
and um

260
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,180
so this is a well-known uh we expect

261
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,680
other car makers to follow suit and

262
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,079
there were already

263
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,279
dissatisfied customers

264
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,740
who have looked for alternative

265
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,300
Solutions

266
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,320
to prevent paying money so that means

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
if I want to speak plainly is they were

268
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,260
looking for uh

269
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,200
patches or should I say cracks

270
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,180
to um

271
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,060
to enable their

272
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,540
heat seating for free

273
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,260
we expect that there will be a demand

274
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,380
from not only from these customers but

275
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,760
once

276
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,360
there will be an increase in uh in this

277
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,120
type of service offering by other car

278
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,200
makers the demand will likely Drive the

279
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,120
hacking market so to speak

280
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,220
this means if there's a demand then

281
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,700
there will be a Solutions providers who

282
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,760
operate either clenda Stanley or or

283
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,079
openly and these people will sell these

284
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,620
patches or cracks to individuals but you

285
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,459
only need the small logical step

286
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,860
to see what if these patches or cracks

287
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,620
uh wouldn't help the customer the

288
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,180
dissatisfied customer

289
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,300
but what if this would uh include uh

290
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,720
ransomware or other types of attacks

291
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,380
that would open up the car industry to

292
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,300
uh similar threats that the IT industry

293
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,980
is facing today

294
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,160
so this is one of the uh use cases we

295
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
are looking at

296
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
and the other one is the uh elephant in

297
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
the room

298
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,920
of course I'm talking about the

299
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,279
self-driving cars so these are

300
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,339
a very long way out if someone was

301
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,040
expecting to uh

302
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,620
have a self-driving car very soon and

303
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,899
I'm not talking about that specific

304
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,839
brand of cars which the automotive

305
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,380
industry doesn't regard

306
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,320
as a full self-driving car at the moment

307
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,820
but

308
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,079
these cars will happen and when these

309
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,720
cars will happen it's uh logical to say

310
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,320
that these will be more complex

311
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,800
than uh regular cars

312
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
normal cars today are very complex have

313
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,899
a lot of I.T equipment as you have again

314
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,440
seen from my colleague in the morning

315
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,560
but uh self-driving cars will be more

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,560
complex than uh regular cars and we all

317
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,500
know from the IIT industry is that

318
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,519
the more complex systems are they will

319
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,760
be more harder to secure

320
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
and

321
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,680
we need to be aware of

322
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
what's happening in the self-driving car

323
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
space

324
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,120
and what their security flaws are

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,660
because there will be security flaws and

326
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,440
these flows will likely increase by time

327
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,380
So speaking of risks I will give the

328
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,600
word back to Giuseppe who will talk

329
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,800
about these risks

330
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,720
right so every one of us is uh affected

331
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,420
so in fact everyone either drives a car

332
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,360
if you don't drive a car you maybe

333
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,820
happen to rent the car or you use

334
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,100
Mobility Services which are very common

335
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,160
these days so we are all affected at the

336
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,959
end of the day and the point that we

337
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,420
want to stress out is this is not just

338
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,779
Theory this is not just thinking that we

339
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,399
need to protect something which is

340
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,880
pictures actually it's really happening

341
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,100
today and as you can see from those

342
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,740
charts what I want you to take away is

343
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,440
two things one

344
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,480
more than 57 or 57 of the attacks are

345
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,779
actually carried out by the bad guys so

346
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,940
it's no longer the researchers which was

347
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,740
the case in uh the 2015

348
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,360
2016-17 but now

349
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,120
there is a monetary interest as Peter

350
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,940
explained so all the use cases the the

351
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,300
services that we expect from our cars or

352
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,780
from our Mobility provider to unlock uh

353
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,140
customer centricity and for the

354
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,839
customers or for the ums unlock new

355
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,880
revenue streams actually is pretty much

356
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,299
affected so the other thing to note is

357
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,699
that in the industry and Peter you

358
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,859
mentioned it's still somewhat in the

359
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,319
infancy

360
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,599
Automotive cyber security is not a big

361
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,419
things in terms of years like we know in

362
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,039
the IT industry it's like 2014 2015 even

363
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,340
there was one pivotal moment with the

364
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,059
famous gpac in 215 where it was proven

365
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,220
that you could do something to vehicles

366
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,460
on the road as they drive so if you see

367
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,179
on the left hand side of the chart

368
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:56,220
it's about 60 percent of the C Eves in

369
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,160
the outer space from 2016 to 21 actually

370
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,220
were medium or high severity and that

371
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,200
tells you something that we need to do

372
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,260
something about it and another number

373
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,539
that I want to share with you is

374
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,220
um

375
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,799
253 percent it's skyrocketing from last

376
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,179
year to this year the increase by the

377
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,000
incidents that we have been able to

378
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,360
unlock and understand that are happening

379
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,700
out in the wild so it's really important

380
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,059
to look not only at this exposure and

381
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,799
the use cases and to give you another

382
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,260
flavor

383
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,799
you see a chart so what are attackers

384
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,539
today carrying out what what is the talk

385
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,120
what what is the interest and um as you

386
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,179
can see from from the chart here is

387
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,179
it's uh the Privacy so it's a service on

388
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,000
one hand on the other hand stolen cars

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,340
key fobs that's a big thing you hear

390
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,799
that all over the places but more

391
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,960
importantly and this is the number on

392
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,559
the left hand side so the 7.3 percent of

393
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,780
all new incidents

394
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,320
are because of the interaction within

395
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,679
mobile app think for a moment about that

396
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,460
it doubled in the last year alone

397
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,340
meaning that while we try to protect and

398
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,720
you see the attacks on the right hand

399
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,520
side so this is the embedded stuff

400
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,660
infotainment OBD2 ports Wi-Fi networking

401
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,940
Bluetooth you name it we know there is

402
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,120
issues but from a percentage perspective

403
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,620
they're lower than the new things and

404
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,640
it's true that the industry is going a

405
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,740
massive shift from becoming an

406
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,440
engineering company

407
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,419
mechanical engineering towards a

408
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,340
software company

409
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,160
and it said that software is eating up

410
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,179
Hardware

411
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,419
now apis the mobility is eating up the

412
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,940
software that's the next big thing

413
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,520
because we all expect the same usage

414
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,000
with our smartphones that we know in

415
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,460
other domains yeah doing shopping

416
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,740
banking you you have this interaction

417
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,919
that will become the next wave of

418
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,000
attacks as we see it and in that context

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,480
we need to be very careful what we need

420
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,820
to to do and protect now

421
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,960
Peter you talked about

422
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,220
[Music]

423
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,480
um

424
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
complexity I think it's benefit if you

425
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,160
are not in the Auto industry you might

426
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,740
say well what's what's the difference

427
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,860
between protecting a cyber physical

428
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,179
system like a vehicle and the I.T space

429
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,520
I would summarize there are four major

430
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,820
differences so one is

431
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,320
you need to look at the vehicle

432
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,820
complexity

433
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,000
um I will have a quiz with you later on

434
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm curious to see your response so wait

435
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,140
for that

436
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,600
um the car as I mentioned is becoming a

437
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,580
software product in software we know

438
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,100
it's a it's complex and there's

439
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,860
vulnerability inherently in uh what we

440
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,620
built so humans are just bad at coding

441
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,799
so uh that's the fact so we need to keep

442
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,320
up with with security but also the back

443
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,960
end system that we are adding the car

444
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,340
was not

445
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,059
used to be connected it was

446
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,640
built and sold

447
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,900
and there was a little bit of

448
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,780
aftermarket servicing but that's it

449
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,360
today it's connected and it stays

450
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,940
connected for the entire life cycle so

451
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,760
that's adding complexity and we want to

452
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,980
do those Services which need to interact

453
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,080
with the backend System payment billing

454
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,539
information sharing

455
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,580
we want the car to become the center of

456
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,520
our Digital Life like we used with a

457
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
smartphone so we're transferring

458
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,960
information the backend system is really

459
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,460
really important the connected services

460
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,860
around it are exposed

461
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,200
and then the supply chain and we know

462
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,260
exactly what we're talking about

463
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,120
the supply chain if you think for a

464
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,400
moment today there is this chip crisis

465
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,280
it's very easy to have counter fight

466
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,200
products if you don't really pay

467
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,260
attention to your products and follow

468
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,720
the entire chain where it's coming from

469
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,059
is there anything that you need to be

470
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,480
aware of in in that chain and I

471
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,159
mentioned the lifetime is really

472
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,260
important and we'll talk about that in a

473
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,320
minute and last but not least the threat

474
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,520
landscape

475
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,740
is exploding

476
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,799
again the car used to be just the car

477
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,679
you drive from A to B and that's it

478
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,260
today you can do even

479
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,020
um emails you can do payments you have

480
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,500
services that come with the car but more

481
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,080
importantly we now enable a feature

482
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,559
which is good but bad in the same time

483
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,980
meaning we enable over-the-air update

484
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,100
which is a new attack Vector we go into

485
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,159
electrification now we hook up our cars

486
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,440
to the grid and the charging station

487
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,860
there are exposing so all of that new

488
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,400
technology and all new features all new

489
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,679
um capabilities they're bringing a

490
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,740
plethora of new attack vectors to the

491
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,700
industry

492
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,580
and again I mentioned it's important not

493
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,000
to look just at the product because the

494
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,020
product

495
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,740
is just a small part out of a smart

496
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,080
Mobility ecosystem

497
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,720
in other words if you have the highest

498
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,559
barrier you do all the right things in

499
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,000
the vehicle

500
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,280
all the security elements that we know

501
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,520
from the it they have been more or less

502
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,919
passed and transported and embedded by

503
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,080
now into the vehicle but that's not

504
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,039
enough

505
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,940
it's like if you just care in a bank to

506
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,740
protect the safe

507
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,500
while the robber is already in front of

508
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,539
the door of the safe obviously you want

509
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,179
to protect even people from getting into

510
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,760
the building meaning you need to

511
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
understand the entire ecosystem and

512
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,799
exposure and I challenge on this very

513
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,679
much the industry telling

514
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,880
it's difficult to Define what is a cyber

515
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,440
security use case

516
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,659
and what not

517
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,240
for a simple reason we have some use

518
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
cases which we want to happen on purpose

519
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,340
like you want to open the car with a

520
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,539
smartphone

521
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,280
do a transaction

522
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,140
that is a very normal use case there's

523
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,039
no cyber in it but if the car is opened

524
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,980
with a command that comes from the other

525
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,620
side of the world that's suspicious

526
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,260
that's something you want to look into

527
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,659
and you need that intelligence that's

528
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,600
inside in order to able to connect the

529
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,900
dots context is key and it's just not

530
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,640
about the product because that's only

531
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,039
raising the bar and I used to say

532
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,760
between the bar as high as it is there's

533
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,100
still the sky and between there there's

534
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,620
always room for hackers to get in and we

535
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,140
know it's a daily thing now more on to

536
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,600
it if you are in the

537
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,419
I.T industry and not so much acquainted

538
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,020
with Automotive I'd like to share four

539
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,960
areas of thinking now

540
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,940
we all understand in the industry that

541
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,000
attacking is always easier but you

542
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,039
mentioned complexity and complexity is a

543
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,120
big thing

544
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,159
um we'll have the quiz on that in a

545
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,340
moment

546
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,260
and there are new vulnerabilities in the

547
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,480
interconnections we know this from I.T

548
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,520
as well but think for a moment in the

549
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,000
automotive domain 90 of innovation in

550
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
the outer industry is driven out of

551
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,299
software

552
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,600
if you build a car that's 30 000 on

553
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,500
average

554
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,720
pieces components

555
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,000
coming from two dozen of different

556
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,679
suppliers

557
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,020
that's complexity how do you build that

558
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,679
and to make things work worse

559
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,320
a product the very same car and model

560
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,779
that you drive they may look from the

561
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,580
outside identical

562
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,200
but they're not

563
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
it's not like having a same computer a

564
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,860
Mac or a a HP that you replicate with

565
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,200
the same components and then you look

566
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,120
into the security now because of

567
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,460
diversification strategies sourcing

568
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,620
strategies availability different

569
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,860
markets different regulation

570
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,740
carmakers there is no one car that is

571
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,080
equal to the other that is complexity

572
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,440
and that's important to keep in mind the

573
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,679
third thing is the internet we know this

574
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
as well very much in the IT industry it

575
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,299
empowers attackers because now things

576
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,279
can scale in an

577
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,039
organization how many laptops or devices

578
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,279
can you have it's uh very much analogous

579
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,500
to the number of employees maybe that

580
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,380
you have in service so that number stays

581
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,900
more or less stable

582
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
if you are Toyota or Volkswagen or

583
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,659
General Motors you add 10 million new

584
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,299
devices on the road every year that's

585
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,640
skyrocketing and you need to protect

586
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
them over the life cycle and again the

587
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,220
life cycle in the automotive industry is

588
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,980
probably one of the most difficult thing

589
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,960
to handle because

590
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,200
think of commercial vehicle tractors

591
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,860
buses they are out on the road for 40

592
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,940
years

593
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,279
eventually

594
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,919
has ever anyone in the IT industry tried

595
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,159
to keep something secure for more than

596
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,620
eight ten years think of Microsoft and

597
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,460
XP eight nine years and out or the

598
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,559
economics as I mentioned here don't

599
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,140
trickle down because if you think in

600
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,120
terms of your smartphone for instance

601
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,480
every three four years you change it you

602
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,100
have a whole new system with new

603
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,400
Hardware security mechanism etc etc

604
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,840
that's the challenge in the Auto

605
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,080
industry it's really really hard in that

606
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,779
complexity to to thrive and survive and

607
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,020
and and keep that also economically uh

608
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,640
safe

609
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,200
now I promised you the quiz

610
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,720
so a few numbers just because otherwise

611
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,299
everything seems like Theory

612
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:28,140
Let's Talk About Numbers they don't lie

613
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,460
so

614
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,299
how many human brain cells do you think

615
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,640
we have don't look to your neighbor I'm

616
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,720
asking a general question

617
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,299
tell me numbers so it's 11 zeros

618
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,320
two points the extension of 11.

619
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,380
if we look at the atoms

620
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,380
anyone wants to shoot how many zeros

621
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,980
just guess

622
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,679
no one

623
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,039
49.

624
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,539
let's go ahead

625
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,279
how many atoms in the universe do you

626
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,240
have

627
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,960
we have

628
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,260
88 zeros

629
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,240
and now you you would expect it

630
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,460
Automotive right it's a rhetorical

631
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,480
question

632
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,760
shoot me how many zeros do we have and

633
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,740
by the way I want you to know that this

634
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,279
is a Mercedes E-Class because that's one

635
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,340
of the single sources that we were able

636
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,120
to find from 2010 it's the complexity of

637
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,460
2010 which is

638
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,760
far beyond what we have today and

639
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,220
give me a number

640
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,640
come on don't be so shy

641
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,559
90. that's not bad

642
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,559
103.

643
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,799
that is the takeaway that is why

644
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,539
Automotive cyber security is so complex

645
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,240
yeah that gives you an idea and a flavor

646
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,279
now just quickly what is the industry

647
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,440
doing are we just talking about it or is

648
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,000
there something that needs to be done

649
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
about it and in the industry uh since

650
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,740
this year in July there's a new

651
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,279
regulation which is uh the UNSC WP 29 or

652
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,700
it's the r155 156 that's the technical

653
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,460
term about it and what you need to do as

654
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,860
an oem if you're part of the unsce

655
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,640
countries which are 58 States

656
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,000
predominantly Europe Asia

657
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,700
some South African Japan

658
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,320
you have to have a cyber security

659
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,600
management system in place

660
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,419
a governance model and this is typically

661
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,460
done in the industry in a vehicle

662
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,539
security operations center

663
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,919
and on top of it for the software update

664
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,380
management if there is the ability to

665
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,679
update software uh no matter if it's uh

666
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,720
by the way over the air or you do it in

667
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,820
a service shop you need to have a

668
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,500
management system that would look into

669
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,779
versioning so all the stuff that we know

670
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,899
from traditional it so it's hating the

671
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:07,140
barrier because we as a consumer need to

672
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,080
expect safe cars at the end of the day

673
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,159
or at least we should strive to have

674
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:15,539
resilience in in the things that we

675
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,520
built so that's effective for new

676
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,399
vehicle types this year

677
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,980
2024 it will be effective for all

678
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,720
vehicle types and what it means is if a

679
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,700
comic doesn't comply with that

680
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,279
regulation they will not get the

681
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,679
homologation meaning they can not sell

682
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,899
cars which is a big thing if you are in

683
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,659
the Auto industry selling cars so what

684
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,100
does it mean for all the other countries

685
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,120
you may ask so like us and South America

686
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,220
obviously very much like gdpr this will

687
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,500
raise the bar

688
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,200
and if you want to sell American cars in

689
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,080
the US or cars that are built in the US

690
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,399
but sold in North Korea for instance

691
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,460
you have to abide to those regulations

692
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,980
so effectively although the other

693
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,440
countries are not part of the unsce it

694
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,299
raises the bar for the entire industry

695
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,899
so from a consumer perspective

696
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,279
there's a little bit of a relief

697
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,679
hopefully that I'm able to give you

698
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,020
something is being done but there's a

699
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,880
lot of work to do that's why in the

700
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
industry we partner together there's

701
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,159
different bodies and organization who

702
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,120
come together industry supplier OEM to

703
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,340
work together because this is something

704
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,140
that is affecting everybody and

705
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,260
everybody should care about it and be

706
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,840
prepared to stay resilient

707
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,260
yeah

708
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,880
yeah so uh

709
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,860
you're right this episode we need to be

710
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,919
prepared and we need to work together

711
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,140
but we also need to align uh

712
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,020
our intelligence activities so we need

713
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,120
to align threat intelligence

714
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,500
uh

715
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,960
need to align the Strategic and

716
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,640
operative goals

717
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,419
so if we go back to what I said a bit

718
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,480
earlier so pirs priority intelligence

719
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,179
requirements which are the heart and

720
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,640
soul of what threat intelligence team

721
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,880
does because it defines what our goals

722
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,000
should be when we are looking out

723
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,320
uh into the web so uh just a quick recap

724
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,620
I'm mostly focused on our products my

725
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,559
second focus is the

726
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,940
Hungarian part of the company and the

727
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,580
third focus is on the distant group

728
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,960
group

729
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,140
for getting intelligence

730
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,260
we need to do Trend research

731
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,919
we need to see what the threat text or

732
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,380
the repositories are and we need a

733
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,360
dedicated and good sources

734
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,960
to get the good intelligence however you

735
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,120
are familiar or you should be familiar

736
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,799
with the butterfly effect if you don't

737
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,200
there is a comic on it

738
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,940
so there might be instances of strategic

739
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,159
intelligence that could impact the

740
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,300
operations

741
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,000
so you might have heard that there was

742
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,800
no no rain in China for uh

743
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,719
a month I think

744
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,599
and what was the effect

745
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,080
some car making factories were shut down

746
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,540
because of the heat wave

747
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,000
and

748
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,859
you might be also familiar I hope you

749
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,099
are familiar with the war and uh in

750
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,239
Ukraine

751
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,619
so when Russia invaded Ukraine

752
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,440
there were a lot of uh

753
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,540
car suppliers

754
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,000
who were hit due to the war and they

755
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,859
weren't able to produce parts for the

756
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,359
car makers

757
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,640
if strategic intelligence like this

758
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,200
happens

759
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,760
and we find them then we can prepare for

760
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,700
for example uh if there are no car parts

761
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,980
coming in then the car makers won't

762
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,220
order uh car parts from us

763
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,099
that's something we need to predict this

764
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,280
is something we can't prevent but uh we

765
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,980
can predict this

766
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,040
um

767
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,640
winter is coming so uh

768
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,980
uh wind termite suppose also a challenge

769
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,140
to the car industry but we'll see about

770
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,400
that

771
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,560
so this was the Strategic intelligence

772
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,480
however

773
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,020
black hats or hackers or

774
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,640
still the main source of our

775
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,380
intelligence and that was my takeaway so

776
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,400
uh

777
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,180
there are two faces to each coin

778
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,260
strategic and operational is both

779
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,520
very much needed for uh effective

780
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,380
intelligence operations in the

781
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,020
automotive industry similarly to the I.T

782
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,180
as well

783
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,779
so

784
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,180
yeah and after talking about Theory

785
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,240
challenges issues resolution maybe just

786
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,839
the last two slides one slide is okay so

787
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,359
Hands-On under the hood what is it that

788
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,660
jointly we do in working together one is

789
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,540
bringing in the automotive expertise

790
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,940
that the teams have to understand the

791
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,680
automotive threat landscape on

792
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,660
integrating constantly day by day

793
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,640
understanding how this relates to the

794
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,980
Regulatory Compliance because uh tier

795
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,960
ones need to provide reporting to their

796
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,440
worms where they supplied the product on

797
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,119
the other side it's important to have

798
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,140
early detection Warning Systems being

799
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,359
really part of the deep and dark web to

800
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,420
hear those listening to those rumors be

801
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,260
aware what is at risk

802
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,720
and last but not least once we learn

803
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,420
about even if it is a rumor as you said

804
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,460
start investigating what can we do about

805
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,140
it is this something serious is this

806
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,880
something that we need to take an active

807
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,980
response do we need to do something

808
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,680
about it how do we prioritize it that's

809
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,440
the kind of day-to-day work and last

810
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,000
Slide the sources of where we get the

811
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,940
intelligence besides being the own

812
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,040
sources meaning the research team of

813
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,000
Upstream being part of that that

814
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,280
ecosystem looking in deep and dark web

815
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,040
but also the clear web I mentioned the

816
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,200
report obviously the report is based on

817
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,920
clear web data because otherwise it's

818
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,720
it's rumors so stating the fact is

819
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,480
the base for for the reporting but last

820
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,780
not at least I hope you enjoyed the

821
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,200
session and you had some takeaways and

822
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,900
you're curious about the industries and

823
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,540
the challenges and want to learn more

824
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,260
and with that I think we both I want to

825
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,300
say thank you for your attention your

826
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,460
time yeah

827
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,250
thank you

828
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,570
[Applause]

829
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,820
thank you gentlemen I'm sure you'll

830
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,380
agree that was very cool calm and

831
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,780
collected uh presentation full of

832
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,060
interesting facts and figures very well

833
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,320
done thanks for that pattern

834
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,980
um thank you
