1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,760
over to Paul

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,100
thank you it's wonderful to be back in

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,500
uh Budapest this is my first time to

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,380
speak at activity a few years ago I had

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,599
the opportunity to visit Budapest for

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,139
b-sides Budapest it's a really great

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,940
conference uh

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,160
I always wanted to be a be be an

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,080
activity to speak so I'm very happy to

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,180
be here uh it's one of the most

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,460
beautiful cities in the world I've been

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,960
all over the world but I tell everyone

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,900
Budapest it's a must-see everyone needs

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,579
to see Budapest it's just it's amazing

15
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,579
to see this city uh so I'm Paul Coggin

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,860
I'm from Huntsville Alabama in the U.S

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,760
uh what background expertise is uh

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,739
networking telecommunications service

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,500
provider and I have a a great deal of

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,440
interest in space uh specifically

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,660
because I'm interested in the network

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,940
telecommunications Communications over

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,460
satellites but also have a great deal of

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,160
experience with cyber security focusing

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,140
on I was always the red team guy that

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,420
focused on the network infrastructure

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,760
layer one through layer three so that

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
led me into being interested in

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,140
Satellite Communications and from that

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,640
started wanting to figure out you know

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,020
what just what is going on with

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,820
satellite and space communication so

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,320
this this presentation we're not going

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
to focus so much on the ground systems

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,380
which there's been a lot in the news

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,500
here lately with the biasat hike and uh

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,600
just this week I was reading that uh

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,259
apparently the the Russian commercial

39
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,299
satellite system has possibly been

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,340
hacked so but we're going to focus with

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,100
this talk more on folks more on the

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,799
spacecraft itself some things that uh I

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,420
discovered doing research trying to get

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,759
a baseline understanding of where we

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,380
stand with satellite Communications

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,799
um so

47
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,960
we start looking at uh

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,899
space systems similar if you come from

49
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,880
an Enterprise Telco service provider

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
environment you're used to having a

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,320
security operations center if you're a

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,060
router person like me I'm an old school

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,579
router guy you know a network operations

54
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,639
center with your HP openview Cisco Works

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,440
Etc monitoring health and status and

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,180
monitoring of your network

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,640
well the in the in the spacecraft World

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,099
they have they called the sock the knock

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,040
they call it a ground system

60
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,780
and that's where they have the antennas

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,000
and networks so that they can make sure

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,060
that they have access to the spacecraft

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,640
as it orbits around the world

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,879
around the earth uh so that we no matter

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,500
uh you know what what's happening with

66
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,360
the orbit they have visibility and they

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
can control the spacecraft itself fly

68
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,040
the spacecraft and pull the data from

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
the payload

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
it's on that spacecraft

71
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,040
now when we talk about satellites they

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,379
have a few different orbits

73
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,840
that everyone's uh you know reading

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,700
about starlink the SpaceX starlink

75
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,660
that's in Leo uh the medium earth orbit

76
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,879
the Mio that orbit is a little bit

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
higher up that's where

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,099
your passion your uh

79
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,780
your pnt

80
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,620
your navigation timing positioning

81
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,980
uh satellites are like uh gnss here in

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,480
Europe GPS and US Badoo and China the

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,840
the pnt satellites typically are in the

84
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,860
Mio orbit and then Geo think about Geo

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,620
those are The Satellites that revolve

86
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,900
revolve around the earth as the Earth

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,959
orbits it keeps a fixed location and is

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,480
pointing at a at a specific geographic

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,280
area and as the Earth orbits as

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
satellite orbits with it and always

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,180
keeps a visibility on the same spot

92
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,299
think like a cable TV type of satellites

93
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,280
are all they're always watching the same

94
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,260
spot at Geo they're a lot higher up

95
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,879
it does so from a ground station these

96
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,099
knock socks what I found fascinating is

97
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,780
I started doing research for this

98
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,180
presentation is you know everybody's

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,159
moving their Enterprise operations to

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,019
the cloud same thing's happening with

101
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,360
space I just read this morning that SCS

102
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,580
is talking to Microsoft Azure they're

103
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,500
going to team together and move it uh

104
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,399
ground station services to the Microsoft

105
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,040
Azure orbit Cloud there's a company out

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,020
of leaf space it's going to offer space

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,479
ground station Services called Leaf

108
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,479
space they're out of uh Italy

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,520
um kubos they're they're they have a

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,440
tool called uh Major Tom that

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,000
application is going to run in the my

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,180
Amazon AWS cloud and then Amazon offers

113
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,940
their own ground station services

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,040
like I mentioned Microsoft Azure they

115
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,020
have the orbit service

116
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,060
for uh providing ground station services

117
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,460
and my understanding is that Google is

118
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,259
getting into this business as well and I

119
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,020
believe I've read that SpaceX the

120
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,300
startling network is actually using some

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,560
Google infrastructure right now

122
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,100
now

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,620
so that's really interesting and I've

124
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,960
too surprising that the ground station

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,479
networks here on Earth would be moving

126
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,639
into the cloud as everything else is you

127
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,100
know for scalability to save money but

128
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,199
what's really fascinating is the

129
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,479
Technologies we have on Earth with uh

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,800
with cloud

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,320
are actually moving to space

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,060
so here there's a company a startup

133
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,280
called Leo cloud in their business model

134
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,840
they're actually going to put cloud

135
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,080
infrastructure on spacecraft in space as

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,419
a cyber security professional

137
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,520
one of the questions I had in my mind is

138
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,800
how are we going to do incident response

139
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,960
and forensics when we start having uh

140
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,000
you know ransomware content you know

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,860
some kind of contamination

142
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,440
uh you know Pi you know our private

143
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,560
information uh divulged up in space how

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,360
we're going to clean up a cyber security

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,120
issue up in space you know it's going to

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
it's going to cause uh generate a lot of

147
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,820
new policy discussions to do for us

148
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,039
cyber Security Professionals not only

149
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,139
policy but uh technical procedures of

150
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,419
how we're going to deal with uh with the

151
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,460
cloud and the infrastructure as we move

152
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,340
to space now one of the enabling

153
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,720
technologies that are going to enable

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,280
data center Cloud infrastructure to move

155
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,380
to space there's a company out of uh

156
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,840
Israel called raman.space and they've

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
come up developed a terabyte hard drive

158
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
that is radiation hardened for space and

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,699
I'm going to go in into some more detail

160
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,500
in a few slides of why it's very

161
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,419
important to have radiation hardening

162
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,199
because of the Hostile space weather up

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,520
in space

164
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,639
so so this the problems are being solved

165
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,319
and so we're going to have a high

166
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,259
capacity hard drive up that are going to

167
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,699
be available to be put up in space like

168
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,100
I said this one is uh is going to be a

169
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,380
terabyte drive so you know technology

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,139
evolves it'll get larger and larger

171
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,319
capacity available to us

172
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
now what really surprised me is I was

173
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
working on this research and this blew

174
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,100
me away is apparently they're uh there's

175
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
these large craters on the moon and

176
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,240
inside these craters if you get in these

177
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,740
craters and then go back into the moon

178
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,100
there's apparently lava tunnels I had no

179
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,840
idea there was a such thing as lava

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,400
tunnels which implies there's a vault

181
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,979
there's there was a volcano at some kind

182
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,319
of time I've seen lava tunnels in Hawaii

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,419
on the big island where there's active

184
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,520
volcanoes and the lavatones are really

185
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,580
really cool to see but I could I never

186
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,460
read never understood anything about

187
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,139
lava tunnels actually existing on the

188
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,139
moon but apparently they are and in this

189
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,199
comp Company Lone Star

190
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,000
their their business model they're

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,380
actually looking at building data

192
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,660
centers on the moon and putting their

193
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,039
data centers

194
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,380
their Cloud infrastructure in the lava

195
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,840
tunnels and the thought process is is

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,300
it'll stabilize the temperature keep the

197
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,280
temperature more consistent because the

198
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,919
temperature swings varies greatly on the

199
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,520
moon it could be like 250 degree

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,259
Fahrenheit and then drop like down to

201
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,840
you know minus 200

202
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
um

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Fahrenheit on the moon the temperature

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,699
group you know is all up down so you get

205
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,199
in those tunnels that'll help stabilize

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,080
the temperature possibly and also the

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,360
tunnels will shield the infrastructure

208
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,599
from the radiation it's being the solar

209
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,699
flares the ions and protons and things

210
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,099
the cosmic rays that are shooting

211
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,479
through space if we're going to go into

212
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,879
detail on uh it'll protect the equipment

213
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,020
from

214
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,659
from that hostile space weather

215
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,279
so it's very I found this very

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,240
interesting so

217
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,179
as an old school network guy they must

218
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,399
spend most of my career uh programming

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,020
routers building telecommunications

220
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,019
networks npls things like that this

221
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,620
really uh fascinated me that where uh

222
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,240
the satellite Communications companies

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
are looking at going now in this case

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,980
NTT they're looking at leveraging free

225
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,440
space Optics basically Optical

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,820
technology you know you're not going to

227
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,500
strain fiber across space but they're

228
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,680
going to take open free space Optics and

229
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,200
be able to shoot lasers between the

230
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,940
satellites and build 10 100 Gig

231
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,519
networks up in space

232
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,680
with the lasers and to the ground and so

233
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,779
that's going to enable a whole new

234
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,060
architecture uh Network

235
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,680
telecommunications up in space that

236
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,540
we're used to down on the ground so this

237
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,860
is going to be really really interesting

238
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,839
to see where things are going but again

239
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,240
we put all this up in space

240
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
the bad guys are going to figure out how

241
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,839
to hack it

242
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,240
so it's very very interesting this is

243
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,680
going to be exciting so we're going to

244
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,480
come up with make sure we understand how

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,899
to con and come up with methods and for

246
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,580
monitoring the control plane the data

247
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,500
plane the management plane of this

248
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,060
network infrastructure that's going to

249
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,860
be on satellites up in space just like

250
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,420
we do here on the ground

251
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,339
make sure all that is properly secured

252
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,600
and monitored

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,920
and then how we're going to do the

254
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
incident response and forensics for it

255
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,480
all that's got to be worked through

256
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,459
up

257
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,800
we'll start talking about the threats to

258
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,899
Space Systems as we have on this chart

259
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,240
here for the right if you're from the

260
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,640
going from the left to the right

261
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,940
a lot of threats or old school like

262
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,820
jamming electronic warfare where someone

263
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,680
will generate a really strong radio

264
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,920
frequency signal try to put noise over

265
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,100
power the radio signal to uh the

266
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,080
spacecraft and when the power is removed

267
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,800
from that source of of the signal the

268
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,540
the threat will just go away and no

269
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,880
permanent damage it could be you could

270
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,339
also have a laser it's just dazzling a

271
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,700
sensor and disrupting uh the payload the

272
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,380
sensor payload and then you take it away

273
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,579
and it goes away and there's no

274
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,440
permanent damage but as you move to the

275
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,540
right what if at least if you have a

276
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,700
really hot laser or some other kind of

277
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,380
directed energy like some really

278
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,620
powerful microwave weapon uh that's in

279
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,540
the electronic warfare domain if you

280
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,860
start applying that you could actually

281
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,000
damage the the satellite the spacecraft

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,500
and all the As you move to the right you

283
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,920
get more kinetic and it can be uh you

284
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,560
know say an anti-satellite missile an

285
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,899
ASAP missile that would actually destroy

286
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,779
the spacecraft uh or like I said you

287
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,880
know uh could be a satellite to

288
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,160
satellite kinetic type hit and those

289
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,839
would not be reversible that's going to

290
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,040
create

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,300
permanent damage you're going to create

292
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,279
debris which is leading to a lot of

293
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,260
conversation that everyone's worried

294
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,380
about if we start if there's if there

295
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,440
was a uh attacks in space it starts

296
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,779
creating all of this debris it could end

297
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,240
up creating a debris field that could

298
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,220
cause a chain reaction known as a

299
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,920
Kessler syndrome where one piece of

300
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,260
debris hits another piece of debris or

301
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,079
hits an active spacecraft which creates

302
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,420
more debris and that Chain Reaction just

303
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,519
keeps replicating until there's so much

304
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,600
debris in the space orbit that we can no

305
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
longer access space and so that's known

306
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,140
as Kester syndrome so you may read about

307
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,060
that in the news a lot of conversation

308
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,500
about that

309
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,320
so along those lines

310
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,260
I found it fascinating that

311
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,380
that there's already been weapons it put

312
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,019
in space

313
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,519
I was it was very new to me to discover

314
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,560
apparently back in the 70s when the

315
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
Soviet Union put up the alma space

316
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,000
station they put a 23 millimeter cannon

317
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,459
on the space station I found very

318
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,959
interesting

319
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,000
there's probably other weapons I'm just

320
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,399
not aware of but but I found this

321
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,160
reference I just found a flush you might

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,720
find interesting as well that that

323
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,040
canons have been put into space

324
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,040
but also there is a new satellite system

325
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,899
that's been designed called the Syracuse

326
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,019
the for the French and they're looking

327
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,639
at actually arming the Syracuse

328
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,500
satellite so that it can protect itself

329
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,399
from other hostile spacecraft satellites

330
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,160
Etc that may uh want to damage the

331
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,680
spacecraft so they're looking at either

332
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,500
using a submachine gun

333
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,899
or possibly lasers to protect that

334
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,600
spacecraft from other hostile spacecraft

335
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,160
so I find that better interesting and

336
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,779
that's supposed to be put in orbit in

337
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,680
like 20 30.

338
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,700
well we'll get get back focused on cyber

339
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,360
security type threats uh the the world

340
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,920
it used to be electronic warfare it was

341
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,440
in one separate domain and cyber was in

342
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,899
another domain but but they're very

343
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,620
quickly converging the whole uh radio RF

344
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,160
uh domain is converged with cyber

345
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,660
security so you could have jamming

346
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,339
jamming's a real thread we're going to

347
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,279
go into a few examples of malware uh

348
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,100
that is that is uh have infections that

349
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
have happened to space spoofing there's

350
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,500
a lot of spoofing of GPS and gns signals

351
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,120
happening across Europe and around the

352
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,180
world that's affecting shipping uh

353
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,220
affecting planes Etc has been a lot in

354
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,899
the news for years

355
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,540
about that targeting the control the

356
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,720
control payload the uh control of the

357
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,880
spacecraft possibly that's a something

358
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,160
to Target and because of a lack of

359
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
encryption

360
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Communications might be replayed you

361
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,220
could hijack it you can eavesdrop it and

362
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,320
we're going to go into some detail uh

363
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,639
because I was one of the real things

364
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,620
that was a real interest to me is when I

365
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,620
was doing this research where uh was if

366
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,480
satellite Communications encrypted or

367
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,760
not and so we're going to go into some

368
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,320
detail on that I come up with a lot of

369
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,139
examples and research things examples

370
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,399
zoned out on the internet and open

371
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,440
source and some things I've learned in a

372
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,000
grad school program and I'm actually

373
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
pursuing a fourth Masters in Space

374
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,820
Systems because of my interest in space

375
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,680
and so we'll go into some examples of

376
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,699
why

377
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,220
a lot of the spacecraft are not using

378
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,699
encryption

379
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,360
so to jump into that so so there's a lot

380
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,600
of sources for Galactic cosmic rays out

381
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
in space but the primary source here

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,180
especially here for Earth is our sun

383
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,000
and it's in all these Galactic cosmic

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,899
rays with protons and ions and

385
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,440
specifically the ions are uh what is

386
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
what very it's very disruptive and even

387
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,800
here on Earth

388
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,100
our atmosphere protects the Earth from

389
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,620
most of this activity the

390
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,360
electromagnetic activity is happening

391
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,740
from the Sun there's a great deal of

392
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,139
activity on the sun right now that we're

393
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,639
worried about actually on Saturday

394
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,760
October the 8th there's the scientists

395
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,800
are estimating that there are some

396
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,779
activity that's happening in eruption on

397
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,579
the Sun that we may see some negative

398
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,860
effects here but there's uh it could

399
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,040
affect like the power grid I read where

400
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,959
there was trains in northern Europe

401
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,980
where uh the train tracks were actually

402
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,839
the signals were signaling that there

403
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,519
was trains on the track when there

404
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
really wasn't a train on the track as a

405
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,860
result uh these cosmic rays uh hitting

406
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,779
uh making it through worse atmosphere

407
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,300
and affecting electronics and my

408
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,980
understanding is also our pirate Grid

409
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,779
it's going to take some major upgrades

410
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,639
to our power grid to totally protect

411
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,620
this from a major uh Cosmic

412
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,060
solar wind storms

413
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,740
now what does that have to do with

414
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,820
spacecraft

415
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,740
but

416
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,980
what is just like a our like I said our

417
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,199
solar system our atmosphere here on

418
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,760
Earth is protected from most of this

419
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,420
activity but up in space damage from you

420
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,100
know the further you get out in the

421
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,839
space you have less atmosphere to

422
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,120
protect the equipment and so the

423
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,620
satellites the spacecraft the space

424
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,899
station Etc are out there closer to

425
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,220
these sources

426
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,139
have less atmosphere to protect them

427
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,540
especially the higher higher they go up

428
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,060
into orbit

429
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,040
those uh solar flares those ions that

430
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,199
are when they hit those spacecraft it

431
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,899
causes an event called us a

432
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,720
a single event upset and what happens is

433
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,640
it can flip bits on the electronics

434
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,260
you're not going to only it can only it

435
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,599
can degrade

436
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,400
the equipment on the spacecraft over

437
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,160
time but but electronically I think if

438
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,480
you were trying to do encryption if

439
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,740
you're trying to have encrypted

440
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,559
Communications you're trying to exchange

441
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,240
keys

442
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,559
and you start getting these single event

443
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,199
upsets and bids start getting flipped it

444
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,280
wasn't going to happen it's going to

445
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,480
kill the encryption you're going to lose

446
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,040
your connection you don't have to do the

447
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,660
key exchange all over it again to get

448
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,460
your connection re-established that's

449
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,080
bad news if you're trying to fly a

450
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,880
spacecraft or trying to manage your

451
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,919
payload on the spacecraft and that's

452
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,539
where all we have to use radiation

453
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,360
hardening to protect this equipment so

454
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,460
that all this solar flare activity in

455
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,500
these sources of cosmic rays don't

456
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,660
affect the equipment but when we start

457
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,240
adding this radiation hardening

458
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,160
it can

459
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
and I it obviously it adds cost it makes

460
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
things more complex makes things more

461
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,720
difficult it increases uh the overall

462
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,240
budget requirements for the project and

463
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,160
so you have to do this risk analysis and

464
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,179
way out

465
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,039
you know the the benefits but if you

466
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,980
know if it's some sensitive

467
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,360
Communications very sensitive activities

468
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,000
on those payloads then you're going to

469
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,280
want to go and add the the radiation

470
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,799
hardening so that you can protect your

471
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,600
electronics and protect the encryption

472
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,080
uh of your of your network connections

473
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,360
but a lot a lot of the satellite

474
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,220
Communications are out there

475
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,440
they're not encrypted and so we're going

476
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,059
to go into some examples of that

477
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,200
and because it's not encrypted it's been

478
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
published at black hat Defcon quite a

479
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,020
bit since back 2009 I believe it's from

480
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,720
2010 some of the first papers I've seen

481
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,120
published where some researchers went

482
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,880
into pretty good detail of how you can

483
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,100
go and passively monitor satellite

484
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,380
Communications you get a specialized

485
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,120
card your dish

486
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,360
uh and basically you can end up uh being

487
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,980
able to pull Network traffic right up

488
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,299
and right out of the air

489
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,700
and read it with your Wireshark your

490
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,340
packet analyzer

491
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,260
which opens up some interesting ideas

492
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,760
about being able to do threat hunting

493
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,860
and identify threads that are out there

494
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,780
in space because of the traffic that is

495
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,379
unencrypted

496
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,419
oh here's a real world example

497
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,240
of unencrypted communications there was

498
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,520
a Navy satellite a U.S Navy satellite

499
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,299
that used the UHF band and apparently it

500
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,240
was unencrypted in this satellite in

501
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,520
this case

502
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
some uh radio

503
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,140
[Music]

504
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,000
enthusiasts

505
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,260
they uh discovered that they could use

506
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,820
the satellite for for their radio

507
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,520
communications specifically for the CB

508
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,340
Community CB radio communications and it

509
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,780
was a legal of course and by the time

510
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,200
they got busted uh 39 people were

511
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
arrested across nine different states in

512
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,140
Brazil and what and according to what

513
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,820
the open source information is out there

514
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,740
by the time they went and arrested all

515
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,720
these 39 people that they identified

516
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,200
using the the satellite illegally for

517
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,240
the communications more people were on

518
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,039
the network using it I mean as soon as

519
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,240
they got those arrested there were more

520
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,220
people that it discovered and were using

521
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,980
it so that's an example of unencrypted

522
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,320
Communications on the satellites

523
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
this is pretty famous One

524
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,720
it also helps prove the point that

525
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,520
encrypt that there's a lot of open

526
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,620
unencrypted Communications out there and

527
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
if you want if you're using satellite

528
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,220
Communications at home like I I lived in

529
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,960
a rural part of the U.S for many many

530
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,539
years in my internet connectivity was

531
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,799
satellite that's the only thing I could

532
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,620
get I can get I finally after 10 years I

533
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,179
finally have fiber

534
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,919
but for many many years I was having

535
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,740
used satellite and it was all open and

536
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,480
in this case

537
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,940
to prove the point about open encrypted

538
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,980
unencrypted Communications there was the

539
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,419
turtle malware if you haven't heard

540
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,340
about it where uh

541
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,400
the the malware

542
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,799
someone would get infected in the

543
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,140
malware would report back to the C2

544
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,220
server

545
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,679
through satellite broadcast

546
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,520
async tell the C2 server hey I'm I'm

547
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,160
infected in the C2 server is out

548
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,679
squatted out in some out in uh in the

549
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,020
satellite Network it's spoofing an IP

550
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,179
address it was available and just

551
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,260
listening because of all the

552
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,640
communications from the satellite is

553
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
being broadcast to the ground so he's

554
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,360
just having to listen and then when it

555
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,460
received notification that somebody had

556
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,220
been been infected with the malware then

557
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,500
over a physical wire line

558
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,659
it would go and start sending commands

559
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,480
and so the communications were async if

560
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,340
you're a threat Hunter monitoring and

561
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,840
looking for this type of traffic it's

562
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,220
going to be really hard to detect it

563
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,020
when you're getting one part of the

564
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,940
connection over uh satellite broadcast

565
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,159
in the in another part of the

566
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,659
communication is going over a wire line

567
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,299
very sophisticated uh

568
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,159
attack but this would not have been

569
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,440
possible if encryption was used

570
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,760
now

571
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,919
there are there is research going into

572
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,200
this to try to remediately remediate

573
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,260
some of these problems where uh where

574
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,580
the budgets

575
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,039
it's not cost feasible to add radiation

576
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,260
hardening to the satellite

577
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,080
uh in this example the European Space

578
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,100
Agency

579
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,500
what I've read is uh they're developing

580
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,720
some Hardware from that was published

581
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,760
was published in 2019

582
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,679
they're putting out a testing of

583
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,740
solution where some uh

584
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,720
pre-shared Keys could be put in the

585
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,039
hardware

586
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,559
and uh there have been putting redundant

587
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,280
fpgas in the hardware as well so that if

588
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,340
the satellite into like a cubesat was to

589
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,919
be hit with a solar storm solar flares

590
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,360
you know the ions the single event

591
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,659
upsets they start disrupting Electronics

592
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,880
there would already be pre-shared keys

593
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,240
on the satellite so that if there was a

594
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,580
problem during the whole negotiation and

595
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,100
sharing Keys there's already keys on the

596
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,780
satellite so that the satellite can

597
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,480
recover commute secure Communications

598
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,159
quickly without having to go through

599
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,740
radiation hardening and also with the

600
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,500
Redundant fpgas may be the say the solar

601
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,620
flare some kind of space weather anomaly

602
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,960
if it affects One processor you have the

603
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
Redundant processor to take over and

604
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,220
give you a little redundancy so there

605
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,039
are there are some some things happening

606
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,500
some research to to help mitigate this

607
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
problem without having to go through the

608
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
expense of radiation hardening for

609
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,020
low-called satellites

610
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,620
nope

611
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,200
one example that was published I believe

612
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,320
it was brief that black Hatter Defcon uh

613
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,020
where malware was used it had an effect

614
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,659
in space speculated that the stux knit

615
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,600
malware somehow found its way into an

616
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,580
Indian satellite cable TV satellite

617
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,360
company

618
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,360
uh and they had a cable TV satellite

619
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,620
called inside 4B and it speculated

620
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,600
that that they were using the Siemens

621
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,860
win CC

622
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,260
and the same PLC the PLC was on the

623
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,360
satellite and was used to rotate the

624
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
solar panels on the satellites is what

625
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,580
what is believed and so so the stocks

626
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,559
and malware found its way into the

627
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,419
ground station and through the ground

628
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,179
station was able to get on the satellite

629
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,299
and disable the inside 4B satellite

630
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,039
there's a lot of arguing back and forth

631
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,799
whether what happened there but I found

632
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,480
it very interesting that that scenario

633
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,580
might have played out where stuxnet

634
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,860
actually disabled a satellite possibly

635
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,520
foreign

636
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,520
this was in malware

637
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,159
was the roadside satellites it was a U.S

638
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,799
German collaboration

639
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,620
where the satellite was uh was looking

640
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,740
was designed to look into deep space

641
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,659
speculated that someone broke into a

642
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,039
ground station

643
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,659
and was able to go from the ground

644
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,480
station to control the satellite and to

645
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
turn the set the satellite toward the

646
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,380
sun which ended up disabling the

647
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,860
satellite

648
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,260
foreign

649
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,520
hack that happened was uh landsat 7

650
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,840
apparently at two different occurrences

651
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,340
around 12 minutes each uh in 2007 in

652
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,120
2008 the landsat 7 satellite was uh

653
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,960
was hacked in my understanding is the

654
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,820
based on what I've read in the articles

655
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,400
about this the Publications is the

656
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,860
satellite was hacked the bad guys had

657
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,760
access to it and they had the level of

658
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,380
access that they could control the

659
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,700
satellite

660
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,740
but they didn't my my

661
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,779
what I'm speculating

662
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,360
is that the satellite has what they call

663
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,740
a lot of these satellites have what they

664
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,919
call a watchdog where after there's a

665
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,659
period of time if certain activity is

666
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,880
not happening that it will revert back

667
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,279
to a known good state I'm speculating

668
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,820
that maybe uh with a with these with a

669
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,400
few more of these examples that the uh

670
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,020
whoever broke into these satellites

671
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,640
maybe they got in and through being

672
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,740
security by obscurity maybe they got

673
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,179
into the satellite and they didn't know

674
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,860
the operating system the command

675
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,500
language because there's like over 20

676
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,559
operating systems and over 20 something

677
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,200
uh command languages

678
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,900
on the Opera on the satellites in

679
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,820
addition to like over 20 something uh

680
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,640
protocols so maybe uh they got on the

681
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,159
satellite it's kind of like a uh a real

682
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,620
you know maybe a really sharp windows

683
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,679
hacker gets onto a uh

684
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,320
an old school you know no Solaris VMS

685
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,600
box they made me know what they're doing

686
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,159
on Windows but they don't know what

687
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,440
they're doing on that that old Solaris

688
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,860
uh BMS box so they got in but they

689
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,480
didn't they couldn't go any further and

690
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,539
then the Watchdog timers reverted back

691
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,880
and uh got the silage back to a known

692
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,620
state so that the owners of the assets

693
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,320
could uh Take Back Control

694
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,360
that's my speculation anyway

695
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,580
uh I don't know what really happened but

696
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,779
I'm just trying to think through the

697
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,539
problem this is a terror satellite it

698
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,880
was also hacked it was high for two

699
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,080
minutes in 2008 and then in June of 2008

700
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,860
and hacked again in October of 2008. two

701
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,120
different times similarly I was

702
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,760
wondering about uh what was going on

703
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,200
there but they were able to take back

704
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
control the asset owner whoever owns the

705
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,520
satellite can be able to take it back

706
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
over

707
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,580
uh

708
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,179
and then in 2014 it's uh attributed to

709
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,120
China that they broke into the NOAA a

710
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,940
NOAA weather satellite for a period of

711
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,220
time and it and access to the satellite

712
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,380
was recovered and the bad guys were

713
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,760
kicked off the satellite but that

714
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
happened in 2014.

715
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,020
and

716
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,220
also there's uh apparently back in 1999

717
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,080
there was a

718
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
there's a satellite constellation my

719
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,159
estimates is like there's Force there's

720
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,140
four satellites in this constellation

721
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,980
called Skynet in the UK and there's

722
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,840
there's a lot of arguing back and forth

723
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,220
about really what happened with this

724
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,720
satellite constellation but one of the

725
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,240
satellites apparently got compromised it

726
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,020
speculated by some that uh that

727
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,419
that was hacked and was held for ransom

728
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,059
there's a there's a big dispute that

729
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,000
says no it wasn't wasn't held for ransom

730
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,620
it wasn't totally completely taking

731
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,539
control of but the control Channel

732
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,460
between the ground station the satellite

733
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,799
was take was hacked

734
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,600
uh so

735
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,100
it depends on who you want to believe

736
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,840
there's a there's a lot of back and

737
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,640
forth about this when you might have

738
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,159
like said happened back in 1999

739
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,380
but they did get some level of access to

740
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,580
the satellite at least to the control

741
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,260
Channel

742
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,360
uh well again from a malware standpoint

743
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,240
there was two two events I found on the

744
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,320
space station where uh Russian

745
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,659
astronauts cosmonauts introduced malware

746
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,880
to the space station and it did not get

747
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,179
access to the flight control system they

748
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,100
would have threatened the lives of the

749
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,039
astronauts and the uh the space station

750
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,240
itself

751
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,240
but uh but it did there wasn't the

752
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,220
infections malware infections on the

753
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,960
space station one was introduced through

754
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
a USB flash drive and another was uh

755
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,179
through a laptop

756
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,679
that introduced malware in the space

757
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,299
station so I found that interesting so

758
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,200
we're gonna have to do rinse and

759
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,020
response and forensics and Recovery up

760
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,399
in space like we mentioned earlier

761
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,679
there there are organizations that are

762
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,720
looking at the space that the security

763
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,880
for Space Systems and developing the

764
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,279
standards and best practices there's an

765
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,419
international organization the

766
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,640
consultative committee for space Data

767
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,779
Systems

768
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,580
it's an international body think like

769
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,640
itu IEEE they're working on the

770
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,260
standards and best practices for

771
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,899
securing satellites uh you know the

772
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,460
protocols they come up with the

773
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,919
different protocols to standardize how

774
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,059
you know to communicate with your

775
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,340
satellites and also they come up with a

776
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,340
way to secure in both the ground station

777
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,380
and the the spacecraft as well as the

778
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,120
protocols

779
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,940
so that's all being heavily worked now

780
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,740
the question is is

781
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,919
what is the risk you know uh you got to

782
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,600
balance it out what is your budget how

783
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,100
much time you want to spend on security

784
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,020
hardening

785
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,899
uh the value of the assets Etc so not

786
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,220
everyone is implementing all the

787
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,840
security capabilities that are

788
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,419
recommended due to budget and uh

789
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,640
perceived risk

790
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,140
and now you're not as the risk has

791
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,940
evolved and capabilities have gotten

792
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,860
sophisticated when these spacecraft get

793
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,960
launched up in space however long they

794
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,360
they they're up there you know that

795
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,919
doesn't stop us on Earth from doing

796
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,299
research and discovering vulnerabilities

797
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,880
now that spacecraft the spacecraft is up

798
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,140
in orbit

799
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,659
it's a hard to patch it but the good

800
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,220
thing the good things happening now with

801
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,320
new spacecraft if software is moving

802
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,140
towards software-defined networking uh

803
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,240
with virtualization with DMS and

804
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,380
containers things like that

805
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,600
software-defined radio so that when you

806
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,120
get a with these new assets these new

807
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,460
spacecraft assets up into space if

808
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,960
there's bugs if there's issues

809
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,059
vulnerabilities it's more easily to

810
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,880
patch and upgrade the spacecraft and add

811
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,679
new features and capabilities once it's

812
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,360
in orb is going toward a

813
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,640
software-defined satellite

814
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,580
now here's the long list of uh best

815
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,140
practices I know you can't read this if

816
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,880
you'll hit me if you're interested I can

817
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,980
send you the slides and I'll give you a

818
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,440
share that has uh the spreadsheet with

819
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,179
all these uh reference links in it if

820
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,559
you're interested in spacecraft security

821
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,080
there is a great deal of work going on

822
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,960
in the domain nist has has released a

823
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,200
couple of Standards uh nist 8270 Nest

824
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,159
8401 our uh best practice guidelines

825
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,320
that they've released for how to secure

826
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,740
the ground station and spacecraft

827
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,020
down at the very bottom there there's a

828
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,200
a reference to Germany German the German

829
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,380
government space organization uh I

830
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,880
believe Airbus has collaborated with

831
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,380
them on this they put out a best

832
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,840
practice for securing spacecraft

833
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,320
Noah

834
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,580
uh

835
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,120
sisa in the U.S MIT

836
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,000
the university in the U.S Aerospace

837
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,740
Corporation all of those have also

838
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,460
released best practice guidelines for

839
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,659
securing your spacecraft

840
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,000
now if you're interested in spacecraft

841
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,500
you want to learn more about it you need

842
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,000
to you want to build your own Lab at

843
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,980
home here's some really good references

844
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,559
save you some time Googling uh here's

845
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,960
them that are some resources are pretty

846
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,779
good uh there's the open site kit NASA

847
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,360
in the openside kit NASA provides uh the

848
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,159
common flight

849
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,640
the CFS the core flight system

850
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,059
that's a cubesat

851
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,279
operating system ball Aerospace Cosmos

852
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,080
is included with that that is a ground

853
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,019
system software that will control the

854
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,840
the core flight cubesat system in that

855
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,820
CFS will run on like a beagle bone

856
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,100
Raspberry Pi run it in a Docker

857
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,980
container what have you uh there's also

858
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,880
the nos3 from NASA and by the way

859
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,640
there's uh the 42 space simulator which

860
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
is an orbit simulator so you can

861
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,720
simulate an orbit as well all on your

862
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
system

863
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,899
um in the if you want some variety I've

864
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,799
discovered that uh that space chain OS

865
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,120
it's a design for a blockchain

866
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,039
application in space

867
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,340
it's uh from a company in China

868
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,039
and uh it's also and there's also the

869
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,039
solex OS it's available on GitHub and

870
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
that is the my understanding is that is

871
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,159
the operating system that the Chinese

872
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,700
use for their spacecraft and space the

873
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,580
space chain OS is apparently based on

874
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,339
Silex as well to and then there's the

875
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,699
Artemis project the sad nogs uh projects

876
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,859
that you might find interesting if

877
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,020
you're into modeling and simulation you

878
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,399
know there's a lot of a lot of uh

879
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,280
discussion on the internet about web one

880
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,619
uh the starlink constellation these big

881
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,418
these really large internet

882
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,280
constellations that are being put up in

883
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,560
the space so that we can have internet

884
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,899
connectivity or anywhere around the

885
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:34,820
globe

886
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,080
you might want to check out Icarus

887
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,599
Icarus is a open source tool some

888
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,119
research is uh released so that you can

889
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,239
Model A a low worth orbit internet

890
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,800
Network

891
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,080
and simulate things like a denial a

892
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,080
service attack against uh these uh these

893
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,540
Leo internet satellites I have not

894
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,399
personally worked with Icarus yet but

895
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,320
all the research I've read about is

896
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,980
pretty cool

897
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,200
so

898
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,780
so uh

899
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,599
if you uh that's about what I had if

900
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,480
there are any uh questions

901
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,579
hope hope you uh got something out of

902
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,859
this I appreciate the activity team

903
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,859
invited me to speak here today

904
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,330
thank you any any

905
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:28,680
[Applause]

906

if

907
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,760
if you don't have any question now you

908
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,859
can always approach Paul the information

909
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,079
is available

910
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,280
uh you can

911
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,200
we have a question

912
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,359
thank you

913
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:44,099
hello thank you very much for the

914
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,960
presentation and uh

915
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,540
the virus that you mentioned that has

916
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,200
been carried to the ISS by Russian

917
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,380
osternote was it stuxnet or other virus

918
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,500
as well and did it affect the the

919
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,320
relation of Russian and international

920
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,880
and U.S

921
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,400
astronautical

922
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,460
organizations and

923
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,099
I didn't if there was anything very

924
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,599
negative about it's just uh you know

925
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,359
you're bringing electric you're bringing

926
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,859
laptops and electronics from the ground

927
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,119
to space

928
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,820
and malware is going to find its way

929
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,980
on the system just like our systems on

930
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,800
the ground here you start bringing thumb

931
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,140
drives and laptops

932
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,460
something that's going to find its way

933
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,260
in it's just it was a problem I'm

934
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,740
intentional was that by uh unintentional

935
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,780
was it a

936
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,720
I don't know it was not by accident it

937
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,160
was it was believed to be accidental it

938
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,140
was not intentional it's just you know

939
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,280
things are going to happen it's like one

940
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,500
of our someone that works on our team

941
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,440
could intentionally bring a malware into

942
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,660
our networks somebody's probably doing

943
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,060
it right now

944
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,200
you know clicking on a link and bringing

945
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,820
malware incident it was not a

946
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,960
intentional

947
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,960
it was just accidental I see

948
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,619
thank you

949
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,339
any more questions

950
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,160
well I hope uh this was informative you

951
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,720
learned something uh

952
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,339
although I learned a great deal

953
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,020
researching this answered a lot of

954
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,560
questions for myself

955
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,940
so if you have any questions if you

956
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,859
would like the slides you know I'll give

957
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,619
you a link uh that has all the

958
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,240
information and all the references and

959
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,339
stuff for all the best practices Etc

960
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,440
save yourself a lot of time if you're if

961
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,700
you're interested in working on this

962
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,020
like I said this right here will save

963
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,880
you a lot of time this link if you want

964
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,619
to build your own lab and like I said

965
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,740
you could do this very low cost docker

966
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,960
bigger bone raspberry pies there's a

967
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,579
great deal of documentation out on the

968
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:45,359
internet

969
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,200
to even help students in high school do

970
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,660
projects with this so there's a lot out

971
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,760
there to try to help the younger

972
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,859
generation come to speak

973
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,960
space is going to be very very important

974
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,380
in the future as it is today so thank

975
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,560
y'all

976
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,680
thanks Paul
