[Applause]

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,550
I think it's a fantastic event I like it

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,490
very much there's a blend of people who

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,560
are very keen to learn new things how to

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,230
break things how to defend against the

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,939
attackers but it's a really amazing

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,450
event

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,980
it was really impressed by so many young

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,420
people who are interested in technology

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,930
I think that the education is very

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,850
important and it's really great to see

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,520
so many people interested to learn more

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,400
how to break things so I think activity

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,960
is very impressive from this point of

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,570
view and it's definitely one of my

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,580
favorite events in the world

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,659
[Music]

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,400
I really like the atmosphere I love the

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,770
fact that there's support for students

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,020
as well so I think these kind of

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,209
community events are really important

23
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,710
where we can all meet up and exchange

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,919
ideas

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,909
I like most about this conference that I

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,340
can meet old friends new friends and

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,579
also people from other parts of the

28
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,979
security scene not just what I do but

29
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,860
from the other defensive side are doing

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,259
we can discuss things with people gather

31
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,659
some insights from from multiple parts

32
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,930
of the industry

33
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,880
[Music]

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
actually two tries to achieve us quite

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
special role bringing together both

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,829
technical people the business people and

37
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,470
the younger generation who are just

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,079
getting familiar with these topics and I

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,100
think it's quite unique

40
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,299
activity I think is a really good cause

41
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,369
benefit ratio the quality of the talks

42
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,950
is really good in international

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,140
comparison

44
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,370
[Music]

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,560
conversations in the the hack Center and

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,910
all of the crazy projects that people

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,860
are getting into and not just to meet

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,720
people but also to learn what those

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,819
people know and and to share your own

50
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:23,450
tricks with them

51
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:31,720
[Music]

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,180
it's a greater and as every year I had a

53
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,370
couple of very great presentations and

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,860
it's a also a good opportunity for

55
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,740
social interaction with similar guys

56
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,500
working the same field trial very good

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,000
conversations in between the

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,630
presentations

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:03:12,560
