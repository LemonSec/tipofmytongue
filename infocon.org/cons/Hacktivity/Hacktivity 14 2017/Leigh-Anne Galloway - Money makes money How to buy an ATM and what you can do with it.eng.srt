1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
hello sir my name is Liang Galloway and

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm here to talk to you about how I

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,230
bought an ATM and I realized that I'm

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,360
now the single thing that stands between

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,250
you and lunch so I apologize about that

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,690
feel free to leave if you have any

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,510
questions and we don't get round to them

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,939
during the presentation then I've got my

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,529
email address at the end of the

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,390
presentation so feel free to email me

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,910
directly or you can send me a message on

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,670
Twitter that's fine as well so I have

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,159
quite a lot of content we'll see how we

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,140
get on so this is the introduction into

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,559
how I bought an ATM so back in sort of

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,680
September October of 2016 a PR guy at

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,390
the company I workout which is positive

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,550
technologies had the bright idea that

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,199
for a conference so InfoSec 2017 he said

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,390
you know guys I think it's a really

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,949
great idea if we try and buy an ATM

22
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:03,570
it'll be fantastic for the stand it will

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,420
draw in a crowd but I've read online

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,600
that researchers have been able to buy

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,840
components from eBay and reconstruct a

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,420
working ATM do you think this is

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,200
possible

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,500
so a few of my colleagues looked into

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,530
this and the idea looked very

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,290
complicated and it wasn't very easy to

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,659
go about so they dropped this as an idea

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,020
and as it turns out you can still buy

33
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,280
parts of an ATM on on eBay today so in

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,840
March 2017 I joined the company and this

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,540
idea was mentioned and people had said

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,030
oh it was very complicated impossible

37
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,130
you can't just buy an ATM unless you're

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,710
a bank will you do it illegally so I

39
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,909
said you know what I'll have a go which

40
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,770
started the journey into buying an ATM

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,840
so just to be clear so I come from a

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,060
background of primarily doing Incident

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,860
Response payment card data breach

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,259
investigations so I have quite a lot of

45
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,000
experience working for financial

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,519
institutions

47
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,609
looking at card data itself but I've

48
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,549
never worked with ATMs prior to this my

49
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,799
only experience of using an ATM was

50
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:24,560
frankly withdrawing cash so in order to

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,269
get started with this I just want to

52
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,549
talk briefly about the history of ATMs

53
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,909
and as the story goes a chap called John

54
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:34,969
Sheppard Baron he drove to his local

55
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:37,639
Brant branch of a bank on a Saturday

56
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,260
afternoon and he tried to withdraw cash

57
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,430
unfortunately this wasn't possible and

58
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,829
he decided this was absolutely absurd

59
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,189
so John happened to be an inventor so he

60
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,780
came up with an idea of how you could

61
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,930
dispense money from a machine and do

62
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,569
this in a semi automated way he

63
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,459
approached a bank called Barclays which

64
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,129
is a UK bank and said I have this good

65
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,919
idea so they worked for about a year on

66
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,090
this prototype and in 1967 in Enfield in

67
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,629
London the first cash dispenser was

68
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,530
installed in the UK and in the same year

69
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,340
a further two machines were installed in

70
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,569
globally so there was one in Sweden by

71
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,629
the National Bank and another by the

72
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,120
Bank of Westminster and at this point

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,939
primarily the the prototypes for cash

74
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,590
dispensers were being developed

75
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,859
individually by different companies no

76
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,889
brands existed at this point and it took

77
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:40,280
a further two years for the u.s. to have

78
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,590
their own cash dispensers but shortly

79
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,780
after that so in the 60s and 70s we see

80
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,269
a lot of development and the marketplace

81
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,449
grows quite quickly so in 1972 the first

82
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,780
online ATM was installed by Lloyds which

83
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,009
is a British bank and now in 2017 we

84
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,799
have by about 3.8 million units in

85
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,569
circulation worldwide and a little

86
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,419
further information so if you're going

87
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,669
to buy an ATM then you need to know what

88
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,889
kind of manufacturers we have in the

89
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,199
marketplace so predominantly most of us

90
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,659
might be familiar with NCR and Winkle

91
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:20,060
they're very popular in North America

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,680
and Europe but there's some other

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,240
manufacturers as well in age

94
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,800
so I'm going to talk about the market

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,050
options I looked at when it came to

96
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,039
buying an ATM so there were four ways

97
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,620
for me there was the legal option so

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,990
that's looking at manufacturers banks

99
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,740
and ATM maintained errs and then there's

100
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,690
the gray market option so that's where

101
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,150
things seem reasonably legal but you're

102
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,560
not a hundred percent sure of the

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,770
background of where this thing came from

104
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,690
the black market option which I did

105
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,889
frankly look at briefly which I think we

106
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,319
all know is something where you're it's

107
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,930
quite dubious the background of those

108
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,789
kind of items and then the last option

109
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:09,060
which I'll go into is the wild card

110
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,159
option which I considered which involved

111
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,039
the road trip of a lifetime and possible

112
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,020
imprisonment so let's get started so

113
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,370
talking about gray market options so I

114
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,020
talked a little bit about eBay and it's

115
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,550
really easy for you to have a look and

116
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,580
see what's available online yourself

117
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,770
when I was looking a lot of the units

118
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,090
that were available were in other

119
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,219
countries so shipping to the UK just

120
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,560
meant that the the cost of the unit was

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,620
just well out of proportion for buying

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,250
it was upwards of ten thousand euros and

123
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,380
just to give you an idea of price so if

124
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,389
you buy brand new ATM you're looking at

125
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:48,409
twenty thousand thirty thousand upwards

126
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,699
but I was looking at used units

127
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,300
predominantly so as it turned out so

128
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,919
it's having a look at a eBay for a few

129
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,449
weeks in March and April and this came

130
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,240
up which seemed to fit the bill so

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,669
there's a couple of reasons why so it

132
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,699
looks like it was working they included

133
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,029
a v80 receipt which was very handy it

134
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,979
was about a thousand pounds which isn't

135
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,979
relatively that much money there are

136
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,080
only a few issues with this so first of

137
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,639
all I needed to work out if this machine

138
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,409
was actually working so I'd need to go

139
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,690
and see it in person and the second

140
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,930
issue with this is it had no keys but no

141
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,400
problem I have friends working in

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,589
security all of which were willing to

143
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,860
help me with lock picking and or brute

144
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,289
forcing my way into the vault so that

145
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,930
was no issue whatsoever so looked like I

146
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,379
had the answer to I had the answer to

147
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,360
buying an ATM at this point so I felt

148
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,789
relatively confident I did some research

149
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,189
online to determine who was selling this

150
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:53,159
and it turns out the company is a

151
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,169
company that deals with a lot of medical

152
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,370
used goods

153
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,069
I found a contact number for them and I

154
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,080
phoned them up they then told me that

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,909
they had the unit I could see it no

156
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:06,509
problem

157
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,819
it was Friday when I phoned them up but

158
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,080
they said unfortunately were quite busy

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,610
at the moment we can't take receipt of

160
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,319
you at the warehouse to come and have a

161
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,569
look at this unit we'll keep it for you

162
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,330
and phone your Monday to come and have a

163
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,469
look monday rolls around and

164
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,800
unfortunately they were very quiet and I

165
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,689
became a bit nervous

166
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,580
so I had a look at their eBay listing

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,669
and as you can see

168
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,129
unfortunately the item had been unlisted

169
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,430
it sounds quite dubious at this point so

170
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,589
it's a bit upset tried to get hold of

171
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,389
the company and they didn't want to take

172
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,569
my call so ensued a rather interesting

173
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,990
email conversation whereby they said I'm

174
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,300
afraid this ATM has been sold via

175
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,520
website for me that was quite hard to

176
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,050
believe because their website looked

177
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,800
like it being constructed in the 90s

178
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,169
followed by my counteroffer to which

179
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,830
they told me to go away so after this I

180
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,930
was really rather sad and still needed

181
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,860
an ATM for InfoSec which is in June so I

182
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,750
had to consider some other options

183
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,069
so my black-market options basically

184
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,229
consisted of messaging and phoning a lot

185
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,569
of friends that I have and asking if

186
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,060
they knew of any ways in which I could

187
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,529
take obtain an ATM very very quickly no

188
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,990
matter the method this didn't go too far

189
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,229
but you may know dodgy of friends so

190
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,659
this is an option to consider when

191
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,620
you're looking at buying an ATM and the

192
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,250
fourth option is yes my CEO endorses the

193
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,300
craziest of ideas

194
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,540
so this involved a road trip of over

195
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,180
1,800 miles all the way from Russia to

196
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,920
the UK with a guaranteed ATM but

197
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,140
unfortunately might mean that I would

198
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,810
have to spend some time in prison

199
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,250
because if you want to cross the border

200
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,990
from Russia into the rest of Europe

201
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,540
customs require you to have a deposit

202
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,220
that's worth well over the cost of the

203
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,770
actual goods unfortunately and with my

204
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,110
nationality being British as well there

205
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,000
was some question over whether this was

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,060
a good idea but I was ensured that we

207
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,430
could get an ATM in this way and it

208
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,020
would only take about a week of

209
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,760
continuous driving sounds like a great

210
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,770
idea right so let's talk about the legal

211
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,050
procurement method which is what I ended

212
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,630
up going with this is definitely the

213
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,200
easiest option it may be even easier for

214
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,450
some of you depending where you live so

215
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,490
what I did is I have some friends and

216
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,310
banks and I said can you lend me an ATM

217
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,860
you have ATMs in your security labs is

218
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,790
that a possibility some of my friends

219
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,740
were happily enough happy enough to

220
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,380
entertain the idea and they they asked

221
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,450
if this is a possibility but were unable

222
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,260
to I also spoke to some of my friends

223
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,150
who have contacts at manufacturers like

224
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,370
NCR but they weren't particularly

225
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,680
interested in giving a security company

226
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,940
an ATM for a while and then the last

227
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,890
thing I looked at which is the way in

228
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,810
which I obtained an ATM is ATM

229
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,800
maintainer so there's companies like SPC

230
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,960
international and testlink

231
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,690
which supply the whole of Europe so

232
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,760
again you might know people in banks who

233
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,380
are willing to lend you an ATM that

234
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,970
might be an easier option for you but I

235
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,890
actually went about buying an ATM

236
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,530
permanently and so what these companies

237
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,940
do is so they maintain for NCR and

238
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,340
Winkle and for many of the banks they do

239
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,370
the maintenance they'll do refurbishment

240
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,470
on all the components and they can also

241
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,300
sell used units in varying conditions so

242
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,010
let's talk about what you need to know

243
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,740
in order to buy an ATM

244
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,260
so you need to factor in the kind of

245
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,700
models that you might consider I would

246
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,070
suggest going for a free-standing model

247
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,570
because it's much easier to move around

248
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,870
you have to factor in that especially in

249
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,210
the UK from my experience is that you

250
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,640
have to have a good backstory so it's

251
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,380
not the most complicated of social

252
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,120
engineering but when I spoke to these

253
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,370
companies they'd said things like I've

254
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,160
worked here for five years as an Account

255
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,840
Manager and this is the first time I've

256
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,180
had this kind of an inquiry because

257
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,340
they're used to selling multiple units

258
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,980
to financial institutions so if you want

259
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,680
to buy just one ATM you have to have a

260
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,370
bit of a story that checks out as it

261
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,500
when I chose to just stand by the story

262
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,420
that I work for a security company we do

263
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,030
ATM assessments we have ATMs in other

264
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,990
countries all of which is true you have

265
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,420
to factor in lead time so if you look at

266
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,240
ATM maintained errs they often get they

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,380
know that they're going to get in

268
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,720
certain models of ATMs within the next

269
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,460
six months but if you have a specific

270
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,380
deadline like I had which was a

271
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,240
conference you have to take that into

272
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,620
consideration so they might have

273
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,020
specific units or specific components

274
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,970
that you're interested in but you just

275
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,770
need to factor in that the lead time

276
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,530
tends to be quite long as well as the

277
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,660
potential delivery time you also need to

278
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,880
know the exact configuration so I looted

279
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,260
to that with the models so you need to

280
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,750
know what kind of PC you want in there

281
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,170
whether you want an international PIN

282
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,700
pad and as I said whether you want

283
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,910
freestanding or built into a wall and

284
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,800
then in terms of logistics this is

285
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,500
probably the hardest bit it's relatively

286
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,870
easy to buy an ATM storing moving and

287
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,090
supplying power to an ATM is probably

288
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,840
the hardest part in my experience so

289
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,560
ATMs tend to weigh close to a ton in

290
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,800
weight which means that no floor is

291
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,110
suitable for this thing absolutely no

292
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,180
floor and of course some of the security

293
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,790
is built into the vault being weighing a

294
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,110
lot it's just something that you need to

295
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,060
consider

296
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,030
so eventually I was able to buy an ATM

297
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,820
via Tess link as you can see for the

298
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,190
grand total of about three thousand two

299
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,370
hundred pounds including V eighty which

300
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,810
relatively speaking is not that much

301
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,770
money for a working ATM one thing I've

302
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,660
missed out so you need to understand the

303
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,860
differences between a tested machine and

304
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,500
a refurbish machine so if you speak to a

305
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,290
maintainer a tested machine means that

306
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,420
they think that most of the components

307
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,630
work but there's no assurance if you buy

308
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,310
a refurbished machine they refurbished

309
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,410
every single component so this is really

310
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,590
critical when you're buying an ATM so as

311
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,080
I said I bought an ATM it all seemed

312
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,110
Goods great I was very happy but I

313
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,850
learnt a few other things along the way

314
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,970
so as I alluded to so logistics are a

315
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,260
complete nightmare

316
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,060
so let's talk about some logistical

317
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,580
issues so this was roughly my

318
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,550
expectations for delivery day and this

319
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,090
was what happened instead so as I

320
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,280
mentioned no floor is suitable for an

321
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,950
ATM so this ATM arrived on the back of a

322
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,950
small truck with a powered tail lift and

323
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,220
the guy who delivered the ATM clearly

324
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,360
knew what he was doing but it was

325
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,960
clearly over waited for the van and he

326
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,550
said sorry I can't take this into the

327
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,800
ground floor of a building it will just

328
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,230
destroy the floor so I had an ATM

329
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,290
delivered into a car park which wasn't

330
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,390
great because in the UK it rains a lot

331
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,620
for a start and it has a computer inside

332
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,880
of it which doesn't love rain so then

333
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,590
there was another issue so I'll try and

334
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,890
play this so the weekend before InfoSec

335
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,350
I had to supplies power to this ATM

336
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,900
which involves lowering an extension

337
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,120
cord I did buy an outdoor extension cord

338
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,350
I will point out a down from the top of

339
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,370
a three-story building where you are is

340
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,160
great

341
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,990
so I had to deal with all manner of

342
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,990
things with this ATM another thing to

343
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,670
point out that I discovered as details

344
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,869
really matter when it comes to

345
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,809
purchasing an ATM I failed to realize

346
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,970
that we hadn't purchased two cassettes

347
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,879
now the cassettes go inside the

348
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,709
dispenser and they hold money and as

349
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,329
part of a buying an ATM it was to

350
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,550
demonstrate how to cash out money from

351
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,779
an ATM with custom notes so we needed

352
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,509
access to a cassette so as I said

353
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,579
details matter so make sure you check

354
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,899
all the information so let's talk about

355
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,939
how it works and how you can break it

356
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:57,079
the security stuff alright so as I

357
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,379
talked about a little about it has a PC

358
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,829
at the top it has a PIN pad and a card

359
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,179
reader and then at the bottom you've got

360
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:06,559
the dispenser which you can see is

361
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,269
pulled out to the right-hand side and

362
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,610
that sits within the vault and a lot of

363
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,220
security is in physical weight of the

364
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,079
vault which we'll talk about later and

365
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,389
all of this will connect to the bank's

366
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,509
network and it looks roughly like this

367
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,819
so you could have an ATM the bottom

368
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,999
which sits within a branch so it

369
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,639
connects that directly into the ATM

370
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,619
network or you could have a leased line

371
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:36,350
or a 3G or 4G modem so let's talk a bit

372
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,749
about the kind of attacks that you can

373
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,369
see so brute force still the most

374
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,670
popular unbelievably to ATMs and then

375
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,189
we've got OS level attacks Hardware

376
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:47,869
attacks and network attacks

377
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,540
and what you'll find in most cases is

378
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,759
many attack vectors involve a

379
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,230
combination of all of these so if we

380
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,610
look at the history of attacks most

381
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,049
people are probably familiar with

382
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,269
Barnaby Jack he demonstrated a way to

383
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,869
cash up from ATMs at blackhat in 2010

384
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,779
and he used that by connecting to remote

385
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:13,099
admin tools on the ATMs and then in 2012

386
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,829
we saw the first emergence of blackbox

387
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,520
attacks followed closely by illogical

388
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,010
attacks and then PT along with a number

389
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,079
of other companies published research on

390
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,419
the security of ATMs in 2004

391
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:31,210
team so brute force still very popular

392
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,759
2016 saw a rise of 30% but it has its

393
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,350
downsides obviously you have a high risk

394
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,119
of being caught another really

395
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:40,970
interesting factor about brute force is

396
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,669
that we've even seen examples of where

397
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:46,039
attackers have basically pulled out ATMs

398
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,679
from walls using a car but then they

399
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,779
haven't factored in how to actually lift

400
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,889
an ATM and put it on to a truck as I

401
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,779
said ATMs wear a lot so you have to

402
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,159
really think about the logistics of

403
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,320
these things it's very difficult to lift

404
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,269
something that weighs 800 kilos onto a

405
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,669
van and then escape very quickly because

406
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,419
it's also a tip hazard in the van and

407
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,100
just to show you what some of that looks

408
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,080
like so here's some examples even in the

409
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,690
UK so a lot of people think that brute

410
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,239
force attacks happen in only specific

411
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,649
kind of countries but they happen

412
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,100
everywhere in Europe this was a case in

413
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,549
2016 in Leeds here's another case in the

414
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,710
UK and that's basically what it looks

415
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,289
like if you use the most popular method

416
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,659
so the most popular method is to take a

417
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,450
crowbar I'm not advocating that you do

418
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,450
this take a crowbar and leverage open

419
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,070
the front of the dispenser so where the

420
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,559
money comes out and then you insert

421
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,960
compressed gas and ignite it and it

422
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,149
blows the back of the door off and most

423
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:51,289
of the money will be intact again not

424
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:54,499
advocating that you do that so let's

425
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,749
talk about operating operating

426
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,149
system-level attacks so the first

427
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,919
mechanism that you'll see is not really

428
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,629
a security mechanism but it's something

429
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:04,700
called kiosk mode you see this on

430
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,070
terminals as well kiosk mode basically

431
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,929
just presents the user with a limited

432
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,940
number of functions but it's kind of an

433
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,710
overlay so it's just an application that

434
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,830
sits on top so as demonstrated I have

435
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,200
cuts in my presentation as well so it's

436
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,299
demonstrated by my cats Annabelle and

437
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,450
Elliott using a number of hotkeys you

438
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,830
can bypass this window and gain access

439
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,210
to the operating system

440
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,269
you also have things like Mouse the

441
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:34,429
mouse icon is disabled but that's okay

442
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:36,649
because again you can just use your keys

443
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:39,000
to access the file system

444
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,980
there's no issue at all so just a quick

445
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,430
video of what that looks like and I

446
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,360
apologize in advance because there's a

447
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,190
screen refresh rate that doesn't match

448
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,390
up with my video this is the normal

449
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,190
screen or a screen you would see on an

450
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,160
ATM all I need to do is utilizing some

451
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,710
keys on the keyboard is I can use some

452
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,750
key combination to gain access to the

453
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,440
operating system

454
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,250
and then some money comes out okay and

455
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,110
just to cover a few other things because

456
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,520
there's so many things to talk about on

457
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,280
this specific topic we also have things

458
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,990
like malware which obviously operate at

459
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,700
the same level that generally interacts

460
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,580
with accessor XFS which has an open API

461
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,770
what else do we have ah so we have

462
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,860
application control which is a form of

463
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,620
software which tends to sit on ATMs

464
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,260
which whitelist certain programs but the

465
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,640
problem with that it's relatively easy

466
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,910
to bypass is that many of the programs

467
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,040
that it white lists you can run

468
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,140
third-party executables and many of

469
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,500
those programs and many of the pieces of

470
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
software available to do this have

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,660
vulnerabilities associated with them

472
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,480
okay hardware so another interesting

473
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,030
fact about ATMs is whilst most of the

474
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,910
ATM is made of metal the front of it

475
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,830
tends to be plastic so in some cases

476
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,600
it's so flimsy that you can break it

477
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,430
with your hands or you can use a

478
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,860
household drill so I use my own drill to

479
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,800
do this and as you can see it's just

480
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,750
plastic so you can cut bits of the ATM

481
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,250
out some people might say this is

482
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,620
unrealistic but we've seen evidence that

483
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,960
hole the whole facade of ATMs have been

484
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,700
replaced by attackers before so it

485
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,490
happens quite frequently so then you can

486
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,590
gain access to all aspects of the

487
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,650
computer all right so some other

488
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,250
examples so here we've got Audrey no and

489
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,070
teensy so you can do things like use an

490
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,990
embedded system to basically connect

491
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,840
directly to some aspect of either the

492
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,790
computer or the dispenser in this case

493
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,030
and send commands directly this is

494
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,620
reliant on you getting access to the

495
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,050
service area at the back if you find an

496
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,480
ATM that's just standalone ATM this is

497
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,670
quite possible or you could do things

498
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,760
like bribe a service engineer I don't

499
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,170
think it'd cost that much and then you

500
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,410
can also potentially connect directly

501
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,240
into the ATM network because in some

502
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,300
cases all of the equipment is not

503
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,520
physically protected in any way and

504
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,410
there are other options so if you wanted

505
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,389
to

506
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:25,679
if you were able to gain access to the

507
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,940
network you could push malware or you

508
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,879
can access other ATMs by using things

509
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:35,730
like OS service updates or compromising

510
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,919
VPN credentials so there's a lot of

511
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,440
options many of the attacks involve

512
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,769
multiple vectors and it's a very

513
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,389
interesting area but we have to move on

514
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:49,440
so let's talk about money so in a

515
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,629
typical ATM you have four cassettes of

516
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:54,330
different denominations so in this

517
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,669
example I've got some fake notes but the

518
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,009
amount that so the value within an ATM

519
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:05,220
depends on factors like when it was last

520
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,529
replenished how many of the cassettes

521
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:11,549
are in service and whether all of the

522
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,220
notes are new so if you have fresh notes

523
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,159
in an ATM each cassette holds about 2000

524
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,940
notes if you have a range of mixed notes

525
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,149
then it's about 1800 and that's quite

526
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:27,269
important because in the UK we've

527
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:29,519
recently been issued with polymer notes

528
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,590
so actually you do find that many ATMs

529
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,379
have a lot of freshly printed notes so

530
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,990
you can have more money so anyone have a

531
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,899
guess as to how much in Euros you might

532
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:47,029
find in an ATM higher

533
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:54,100
oh it's around 120 thousand euros give

534
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,700
or take depending on those other factors

535
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,649
so if you're an attacker I would advise

536
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:02,230
you to compromise multiple ATMs because

537
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,019
the jail time the risk associated with

538
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,600
compromising a single ATM isn't possibly

539
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,059
worth it

540
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,230
so I'm going to talk about how you can

541
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,389
capitalize on owning an ATM so the first

542
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,919
interesting thing that happened to me

543
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,529
once I had an ATM in a car park is

544
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,179
everyone who lived in the vicinity

545
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,369
started asking questions about when the

546
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:28,299
ATM would be available for use she

547
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,070
thought as a security researcher is

548
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,480
quite interesting as I mentioned we I

549
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,059
was able to obtain an ATM to take it to

550
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,610
a conference I then had to store after

551
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,830
which afterwards which ended up being

552
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,799
moved to my own apartments because I

553
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,409
have a cod a concrete floor which the

554
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:51,070
ATM destroyed but again my neighbors

555
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,019
started asking questions about when this

556
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:56,139
ATM would be in use so something dawned

557
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,869
on me which is you could put an ATM into

558
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:01,389
the wild with a camera and you could

559
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,879
start capturing people's card

560
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,830
information in their PIN codes and see

561
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,110
how many people actually did this I mean

562
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,879
just as a survey to see how many people

563
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:11,440
would do this I'm not saying you should

564
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,070
do it for the wrong reasons so certainly

565
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,139
that's one way to make money or

566
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:19,389
alternatively you could write you could

567
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:21,970
publish a research article on that but

568
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,559
it's really interesting how many people

569
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,990
immediately said when can I start using

570
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,850
this thing I was able to take it to a

571
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,720
conference so I took it I took it to

572
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,460
infoset 2017 fully intact but it was an

573
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,559
absolute logistical nightmare so as I

574
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,200
mentioned this thing this weighed 700

575
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,919
kilos and unfortunately you can't move

576
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,769
something that weighs 700 kilos unless

577
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:54,549
you have almost a crane as it turns out

578
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:56,950
or someone who's willing to move this

579
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,470
that has equipment for something that

580
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,840
weighs 500 kilos so I unfortunately

581
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,419
ended up having to sort of bend the

582
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:06,010
truth in order to get a courier to

583
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,639
deliver this ATM from a car park to the

584
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:13,240
venue so I found someone who had a power

585
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,990
assisted lift and it was the only one in

586
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,870
the whole of the Southeast of England

587
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,440
and he brought this ATM to the security

588
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,730
conference at 9 o'clock at night the

589
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,919
night before it's a complete nightmare

590
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,039
and then I had to deal with a storage

591
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,549
afterwards so as you can see like I

592
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:35,049
mentioned the logistics is really the

593
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,029
hardest part of owning an ATM this is

594
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,899
the ATM outside of my apartment and this

595
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,269
is some photography equipment that I've

596
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,880
constructed a temporary shelter around

597
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,590
the ATM in order to work on it and

598
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,269
protect it from the weather it was

599
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:53,169
temporary and again the realization that

600
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,630
no floor is suitable for an ATM so I was

601
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,840
able to deconstruct some aspects of my

602
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,240
apartment door in order to get the ATM

603
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,000
inside of my apartment but it completely

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,620
destroyed my floor even though it was

605
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,760
concrete oh the benefit of this is the

606
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,639
BBC took a particular interest into the

607
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:16,210
fact that I now had an ATM in my

608
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,720
apartment so I was able to get some some

609
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,850
coverage of this ATM which was great for

610
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,299
me and for the company I work for but it

611
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:26,860
was completely invasive because this

612
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,210
whole thing was taking place in my

613
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,320
apartment and you can see on the

614
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,090
left-hand side that's Elliot it's one of

615
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,669
my cats being stroked by one of the

616
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,919
presenters he has no idea what's going

617
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,289
on so here's a quick clip of the BBC

618
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:43,510
piece which you may have seen or may not

619
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,720
have and in it they talked briefly about

620
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,690
how you can hack an ATM in a consumer

621
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,100
way so it's very high level

622
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:00,659
[Music]

623
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,750
so an attacker has come to the front of

624
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,880
the ATM they've drilled a hole in the

625
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,970
front you can see we can access this USB

626
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,440
cable right so inside here there's

627
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,750
something that has a USB port what's

628
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,340
inside here this is just a normal

629
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,310
computer

630
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:26,050
[Music]

631
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,660
sure not many people would expect this

632
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,180
to just be an order Windows NT machine

633
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,820
perhaps not but it's just a safe with a

634
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,880
computer on top

635
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:45,329
[Music]

636
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,500
it's the actual real money so you could

637
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,300
put malware on this system that could

638
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,480
collect data from cards as well so that

639
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,910
would be information that's hold on our

640
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,580
cards so I as a consumer if I'm using

641
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,680
this machine you could collect my card

642
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,480
data and that can spread around the

643
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,000
whole network of ATMs so you can use one

644
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,460
ATM to interface a whole network that's

645
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,360
correct yeah and you can see my

646
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,600
apartment in the background so this

647
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,580
brings me on to the final chapter which

648
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,910
has a little bit to do with logistics as

649
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,390
well so if it wasn't evident from the

650
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,390
brief for this talk this ATM was

651
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,870
completely deconstructed to its core

652
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,120
including the vault so I'll just take

653
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,240
you through that so it's a lot of the

654
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,360
security in protecting the money goes

655
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,280
into the vault and a vault consists of

656
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,650
two steals a seize with still enforced

657
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,550
concrete as you can see there so this

658
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,440
was all taking place outside of my

659
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,260
apartment but it's it's interesting

660
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,350
nonetheless to go about this process and

661
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,350
to understand exactly where the the

662
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,840
security mechanisms in an ATM at are so

663
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,060
a lot of the wait as a result is

664
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,070
obviously in the bottom half of the ATM

665
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,210
and I'll just show you how you go about

666
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,680
deconstructing an ATM looks rather like

667
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,350
a Rammstein video but you need you

668
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,270
basically need a bunch of power tools in

669
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,130
order to drill off the concrete and then

670
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,980
because you have steel fibers inside of

671
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:36,920
that it's very dangerous and that that

672
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,260
concludes my talk so just as a summary

673
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,540
what's really interesting about this is

674
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,610
that anyone can do it it doesn't really

675
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,380
require huge amount of skill you just

676
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,780
need a small amount of knowledge to do

677
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,570
this and it's an absolute logistical

678
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,190
nightmare so I wouldn't advise anyone go

679
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,730
about buying an ATM themselves but it's

680
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,860
much easier to obtain legally than he

681
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,130
legally as it turns out so if you have

682
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,900
any questions let me know I've also

683
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,600
included my email address and my twitter

684
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,860
handle there as well do we have a couple

685
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,210
of minutes for questions any any

686
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,860
questions anybody please maybe they just

687
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,750
wanted to go to lunch maybe they'll want

688
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,400
to go to nearest ATM did you find any

689
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,500
specific vendor vendor specific

690
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,299
vulnerability in this ATM or everything

691
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:31,640
you said is just is not specific to the

692
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,460
vendor it's not specific to the vendor

693
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,290
per se what's really interesting though

694
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,270
that you raise a point that I didn't

695
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,919
discuss because I was trying to condense

696
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,350
this presentation is that typically

697
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,760
there's an issue with where the

698
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,919
responsibility of security lies and the

699
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,110
vendors will say to the banks that it's

700
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,390
your responsibility to buy a new unit

701
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,580
and that will solve your security issues

702
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,070
but of course you can configure an old

703
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,580
ATM to be secure hi did you inspect

704
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,960
potential attack vectors that didn't

705
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,970
require the modification of the ATM at

706
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,200
all so keeping it in its original state

707
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,620
and still hack it yes so it's possible

708
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,720
so for example if you access the service

709
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,400
area so you can lockpick the service

710
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,470
area you don't have to physically modify

711
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,419
like the front of the facade no damage

712
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:22,309
has to occur so yeah that's something I

713
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,530
looked at as well is you can then just

714
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,320
send commands to the dispenser directly

715
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,929
that's another option did you get any

716
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,549
attention from the police when you

717
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,740
conduct in your research that's a very

718
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,510
good question so another piece that I

719
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,720
missed out is following this so

720
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
following the broadcast from the BBC I

721
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,559
was walking down the street and there

722
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,690
was an ATM which had been vandalized

723
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,640
shall we say and some of the cables have

724
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,790
been pulled out so I realized that when

725
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,540
you publish research of any kind you

726
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,540
then become like the front or the

727
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,940
receptor for any bad news as well so

728
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,500
people say oh well you've shown people

729
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,540
how to do that but of course that's not

730
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,510
the case because a five-minute video or

731
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,680
a video saying

732
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,270
well this is a computer with a vault on

733
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,470
top obviously doesn't go into the

734
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,720
details of how you would execute an

735
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,360
attack from start to end and it also

736
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,230
doesn't take into consideration that

737
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,270
there's a big difference between people

738
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,550
who work in security and criminals and

739
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,950
that's their intention right any other

740
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,320
questions are you ready for lunch one

741
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,650
more question yes so I would like to ask

742
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,020
what's the operation think system

743
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,900
distribution is Windows XP still the

744
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,580
most commonly used yeah pretty much

745
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,840
since Windows XP and a lot of the newer

746
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,360
ATMs are Windows 7 but predominantly

747
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,260
it's Windows XP well thank you very much

748
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,350
and I hope you will enjoy lunch

749
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:59,419
[Applause]
