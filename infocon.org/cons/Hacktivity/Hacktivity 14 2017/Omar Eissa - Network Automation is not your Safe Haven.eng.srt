1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
good morning well today's presentation

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,330
is about Network automation I'm speaking

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,890
today about the technology that would

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,349
allow you to build not work fully

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,790
automated network in just couple of

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,549
minutes supposedly it should make your

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,490
life much easier much simpler or that's

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,170
how the designers thought it should be I

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,119
work for a security company based in

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,000
Heidelberg Germany and for this topic of

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,680
today I have been working on throughout

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,850
my master and bachelor thesis both so

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,850
what is this all about

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,040
haven't we all had that problem that we

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,629
sent a field engineer to the customer

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,610
side just to install a new router and he

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,140
didn't have the roni configuration with

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,719
him or we must type something and we

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,950
kept days and days trying to

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,809
troubleshoot it but we don't know where

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,510
the problem is what if I said to you all

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,940
of that is from the past what if I said

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,780
to you that now routers can be like USBs

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,390
block and play you just put it and it

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,570
works nothing much no hassle no miss

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,020
configuration nothing at all this is for

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,100
the first part of the today's

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,580
presentation for the second part the

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,530
question comes are we really in control

30
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,780
of our network this technology is a new

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,820
one but it's voice ISKCON is proprietary

32
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,100
we don't know what they are doing with

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,750
our networks we don't know what they are

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,450
running through it and that's why we

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,560
have the second part of today's

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,640
presentation

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,530
it's about reverse engineering

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,000
understanding how the protocol is

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,729
constructed in the last and final part

40
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,920
of today's presentation if you are into

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,860
security or into life hacking wood we

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,720
will have real routers we will try to

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,610
watch real attacks and see whether the

44
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,149
network will withstand our attacks not

45
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,700
so keep it up buckle up and be ready it

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,600
all started in 2001 with IBM they had

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,700
this idea systems are getting more and

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,009
more complex by the time and we wish if

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,320
systems were smart enough so they can

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,710
manage themselves with this idea in mind

51
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,110
they wanted system that are systems that

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,149
are able to configure themselves you

53
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,800
don't need to configure anything they

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,209
should be smart enough to configure

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,410
themselves

56
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,210
they should be smart enough to protect

57
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,250
themselves even they should heal from

58
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,410
any broken processes by any means on

59
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,140
their own well this was an optimistic

60
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,420
view how like future systems should be

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,280
and in 2013 people from IETF and from

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,560
Cisco sit down together and started to

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
write the specifics for this new network

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,830
they called it the autonomic Network

65
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,690
what was their vision for that they had

66
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,450
this idea we only need one single device

67
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,100
and everything that's connected to that

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,610
device should be connected on its own ok

69
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,220
this sounds a little bit optimistic but

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,880
what about the for example how many

71
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,190
configurations should I configure this

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,080
single device you are saying like this

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,310
single device should be the whole

74
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,040
network so how much configuration do I

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,560
need to do here well they are just 5

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,620
commands just 5 commands here either on

77
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,630
the device and after that everything

78
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,330
connects to it works

79
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,120
simple and easy like this how many like

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
configuration lines do I need to put on

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,340
the others one completely nothing just

82
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,940
connect or excuse me this sounds to be

83
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,990
somehow so much optimistic so let's try

84
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,150
to see if it really works so for the

85
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,610
people whom are aware of Cisco devices I

86
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,220
just got a totally a new device here

87
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,950
with me I just raised everything on this

88
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,950
device just before I come here and

89
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,480
supposedly all what I try to do here is

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,180
just I try to connect it to this single

91
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,680
device and see what will happen

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,170
supposedly ask for Cisco this device

93
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,940
should be configured without any hassle

94
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,200
from my side or without me doing

95
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,050
anything I have kept it turn it on for

96
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,730
quite some time now so I hope it works

97
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,700
because usually it just once you put it

98
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,680
it should be very cons on time over yeah

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,420
here we see that although I'm not

100
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,970
configuring anything I'm seeing some

101
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,180
information is sent to that device I can

102
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,160
see that some interfaces are becoming up

103
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,180
on its own

104
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,680
I can see ok it's just taking time I can

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,060
see that there are some keys that are

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,190
generated here I see that some

107
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,930
interfaces even became up

108
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,910
and everything is generated why we are

109
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,910
speaking i didn't configure anything I

110
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,800
didn't put anything this is just a brand

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,370
new device that you just bought and

112
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,090
still there is more and more

113
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,800
configuration being sent right we are

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,080
speaking so to have like a simple idea

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,729
even I can see it on an interfaces

116
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,250
coming up here I would like to see what

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,289
are the interfaces for example that are

118
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,180
configured here I can see now like I got

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,470
an ipv6 address I found like 2 or I have

120
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,090
multiple interfaces we created for me

121
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,160
everything is up and running at least

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,550
now if you are sitting in your like

123
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,750
center you can just connect your device

124
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,270
and put whatever you'd like to put on it

125
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,190
just I did configure anything connect

126
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:18,680
and works so what do we get from this

127
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,020
routers are no longer that complicated

128
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,520
thing that you need to configure more

129
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,340
and more no plug-and-play it's simple

130
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,610
like that if it's a new brand new device

131
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,320
you don't need to configure anything at

132
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,750
all and if it's a device that already

133
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,190
have a configuration and has me run it

134
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,840
for some time or what you need to write

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,300
it is just a single command in order to

136
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,949
understand a little bit deeper about

137
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,690
what happened in the background once we

138
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,520
connected the devices we would have a

139
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
brief overview over the technology

140
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,940
understand what are the main components

141
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,580
of it Cisco device what we have just

142
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,190
seen into three phases a channel

143
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,830
discovery adjacency discovery and in the

144
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,030
end the secure channel for the channel

145
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,490
discovery it's somehow like this one

146
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,320
single device which recalls the register

147
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,870
is sending the layer two probes

148
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,490
searching is there any autonomic device

149
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,259
around just sending sending sending

150
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,770
that's all what's being done here once

151
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,590
it finds the device we start with the

152
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,770
adjacency discovery this register starts

153
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,530
by saying well I support this domain or

154
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,009
this network would you like to join mine

155
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,300
in order to

156
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,729
just determine something like this the

157
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:36,159
this register has a whitelist of the

158
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,530
allowed devices to join because we are

159
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,229
speaking about brand new devices what's

160
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:43,120
there in the whitelist is just the

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,919
serial number nothing more well if you

162
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,889
are allowed to join then perfect we will

163
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,629
generate you a membership code which we

164
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,430
call the certificate here but if you are

165
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,349
rejected then thanks we will just be

166
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,919
like layer to neighbours this is a UDP

167
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,979
service running on port 4 936 we just

168
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,620
need to know that everything here is

169
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,969
ipv6 based to have a simpler idea we can

170
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,379
see it has the following that I just

171
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,509
search starts with I support domain X

172
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,050
whatever it is and the enrollee replies

173
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,860
with I'm from domain whatever why well

174
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,680
if there are two different domains then

175
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,030
they shouldn't communicate with each

176
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,860
other maybe he is from other company

177
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,719
it's a malicious domain they shouldn't

178
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,330
connect to mine many devices can be

179
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,050
apart from like one domain if the domain

180
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,029
name is empty it means well I would like

181
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:40,300
to join yours me as a register I'll just

182
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,370
check my whitelist is this device

183
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,039
allowed to join perfect if it's a lot

184
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,250
then I send them my membership card or

185
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,860
my registered domain certificate and I

186
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,110
will ask them to generate a key for me

187
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,360
we will understand the significance of

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,389
this certificate later so once they

189
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,940
generate the key for me they send it

190
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,680
back and I try to issue them a

191
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,650
certificate you can make your device it

192
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,060
should the certificates on its own and

193
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,650
we call it here like certificate

194
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,050
authority it's which is local or if you

195
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,729
have one which is dedicated in your

196
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,740
network and you would like just the

197
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,169
order CA to configure it for this device

198
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,090
you can just write the IP address of the

199
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,830
certificate authority that you have

200
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,139
inside your network and in the end I

201
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,110
just send it back to you so all of that

202
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,180
I'm just making the membership for you

203
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,360
after that all our communication is

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,740
totally encrypted so even if people are

205
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,328
trying to hack or trying to see what

206
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,130
being sent inside the network it's

207
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,440
totally encrypted not only this it's

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,750
encrypted by something called Dyke or

209
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,820
the encryption mechanism is Dyk it's a

210
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,390
new technology developed by Cisco and it

211
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,050
has less overhead than that of the IPSec

212
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,790
IPSec is always used but for backwards

213
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,290
compatibility we are speaking about

214
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,140
system till the beginning of 2015 that's

215
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,420
the last time they were supported like

216
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,130
IPSec after that everything is

217
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,800
supporting Dyk cisco believes that the

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,880
problem sometimes when this

219
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,890
configuration comes from people so here

220
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,810
you cannot to change anything here you

221
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,000
cannot do anything it just you see the

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,970
like communication going and you cannot

223
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,370
access the interfaces you cannot change

224
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,330
such an order you cannot do anything we

225
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,100
kept saying like we write five commands

226
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,010
what are these five commands it just you

227
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,710
say this device will be registered you

228
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,930
will define the domain ID or the network

229
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,140
ID and if you would like to put the

230
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,680
whitelist

231
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,300
if you don't put a whitelist then every

232
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,890
device will be accepted in your network

233
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,140
and after that you will define what's

234
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,880
the type of CA the one we'll be issuing

235
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,820
the certificates is it local the same

236
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,920
device or you have a dedicated one and

237
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
you can write its IP address and that's

238
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,900
all after they are just no shut down

239
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,730
just enable the services on autonomic

240
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,100
it's as simple as this three four

241
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,990
commands and you have fully running

242
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,750
network and what do I need to configure

243
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,040
if I am speaking about a brand new

244
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,839
device then none nothing at all and if

245
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,990
this device or system has like a

246
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,940
configuration from before just won't

247
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,610
command autonomic and that's it

248
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,050
we are speaking about you will be

249
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,560
configured

250
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,120
what's the configuration that you will

251
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,810
receive well you would have an ipv6

252
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,730
address interfaces will be defined for

253
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,000
you

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,690
a vrf will be created for you and

255
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,770
fernette interface for this secure

256
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,830
communication if you have a syslog TFTP

257
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,960
server in your network it will be just

258
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,000
discovered on its own so you don't need

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,280
to define anything further and even if

260
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,780
you'd like further configuration to be

261
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,000
on the device you just go to the TFTP

262
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,500
write the serial number of the device

263
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,720
and the device will just communicate

264
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,170
with TFTP and download

265
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,570
any further configuration it just

266
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,889
changed how we look into networks

267
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,139
changes the complexity it's really that

268
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,180
simple that you connect and everything

269
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,269
will be automated for you but the

270
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:08,029
question comes after that are you in

271
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,250
control do you really know what's

272
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,480
running in the background

273
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,410
as for Cisco we understand that we are

274
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,949
in three phases and we at least have a

275
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,260
UDP service right now pool 4 9 3 6 and

276
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,589
we have this daikon put 5,000 so I

277
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,600
expect to see multiple phases or

278
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,360
multiple types of packets but what I see

279
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,690
here is this well this is LLC layer 2

280
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,350
technology

281
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,970
Wireshark cannot understand or see

282
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,370
what's really running here you have no

283
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,720
idea what's really running inside your

284
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,709
network so what we will be trying to do

285
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,060
throughout this part from the

286
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,430
presentation is try to reverse engineer

287
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,560
this understand what are these parts

288
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,329
well this is the first packet or frame

289
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,570
that we have how do we store it I know

290
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,370
that in the beginning we at least have

291
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,890
an Ethernet frame but which type of

292
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,060
Ethernet well we have three types by

293
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,560
checking here we know it's some of an

294
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,930
Ethernet to frame and by here we are

295
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,310
sure that we are speaking about snap

296
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,310
frame so at least as the beginning we

297
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,000
understand how we store it we have this

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,720
nation Mac source Mac some frame length

299
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,829
this nav frame identifier the

300
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,149
organisation on the identifier which is

301
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,420
OC for Cisco and after that the

302
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,690
autonomic protocol ID okay till this

303
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,579
point at least we managed to understand

304
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,140
this but what comes after is the

305
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,779
autonomic protocol and we believe that

306
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,329
it can be understood or analyzed based

307
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:47,120
on this header to introduce this new

308
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,399
header we believe this one we can use to

309
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,310
understand whatever comes after to test

310
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,910
this we try to analyze what's coming

311
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,940
further we see here the version and the

312
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,940
state the state says in which phase are

313
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,800
we in in the protocol this is the first

314
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,540
frame this is the first thing so we're

315
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,720
just in the first

316
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,639
factory default never change and some

317
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,490
upwards upwards means what's the

318
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,230
function and significance of such afraid

319
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,149
what's there oh this frame is playing

320
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,879
throughout the whole communication these

321
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,519
are the available up codes for the

322
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,439
channel discovery after that we have the

323
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,019
header length and some reserved Boyd's

324
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,189
than tlvs for the availability of these

325
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,569
for the channel discovery they are

326
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,980
simple as that we are just speaking

327
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,230
about one or two frames being sent every

328
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,120
now and then either probes or keep alive

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
something simple as this the adjacency

330
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,370
discovery is a bit bigger because

331
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,939
supposedly we expect a UDP header here

332
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:51,920
so we start with the same idea this is

333
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
the Ethernet in a frame we already know

334
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,990
that but here is the problem this is the

335
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,730
one customize channel discovery header

336
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,949
that stops Wireshark from analyzing the

337
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,550
packets this thing is the one that is

338
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,800
added by Cisco is somehow like two and a

339
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,769
half layer for this autonomic services

340
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,360
to understand this it's somehow very

341
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,699
close from the one we have just seen was

342
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,009
just however the state is different here

343
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,759
which is all five and either type this

344
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,680
Gator type means what's next header

345
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,589
coming and for this one it's an ipv6

346
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,040
header after the ipv6 we know this is a

347
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,110
UDP header just from analyzing the

348
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,930
what's written in the ipv6 header and

349
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,759
after that we start again with the

350
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,490
autonomic protocol we believe that for

351
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,019
the adjacency discovery it's the same

352
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,490
header we can use the same header we

353
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,019
don't need to introduce a new header for

354
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,980
that and here the version is two instead

355
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,579
of one

356
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:49,730
this state is o2 we just start it into

357
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,680
the channel and the adjacency discovery

358
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
phase this is the first packet here we

359
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,019
have multiple states because either we

360
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:59,029
are like trying to get your membership

361
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,220
or trying to add you into the domain or

362
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,269
even trying to be the secure channel

363
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,389
after that the Reserve boards again and

364
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,930
the opcodes

365
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,300
in this case we have much more op codes

366
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,529
here are they

367
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,460
and after that the header length some

368
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,960
factory default boards and TVs for the

369
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,330
availability of these they are quite big

370
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,310
we would have needed like three four so

371
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,500
I just put the availability alvie's so

372
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,880
there is a link in the end if you're

373
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,620
interested more in know all tlvs

374
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,480
you can just check it and here comes a

375
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,070
little bit of a challenge a secure

376
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,920
channel what should I do

377
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,820
it's totally encrypted port 5000 dike I

378
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,360
have no control over this what if I'm a

379
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,070
little bit interested to know what's

380
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,620
really running and so it what should I

381
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,150
do

382
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,190
Cisco is a black box device I can't say

383
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,620
which case that they should use for

384
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,460
example so the question is if I'm really

385
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,050
interested to know everything about this

386
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,580
technology how do I know what's really

387
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,930
inside and for this please let me

388
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,080
introduce you to this beautiful device

389
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,120
the mp3 600 X it is one of the very

390
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,220
early first devices to support autonomic

391
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,460
network 13 2014 but the question comes

392
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,060
how can that help me well as we said we

393
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,560
have an IPSec for backward script

394
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,430
ability and ike is the brand-new one

395
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,160
also I cannot control IPSec how can even

396
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,960
if I have an IPSec how can I see what's

397
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,720
being sent inside but you know what

398
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,730
from the RFC there is IPSec null in

399
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,640
other words IPSec without encryption at

400
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,660
all just authentication and if we

401
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,010
implement this then we can see a packet

402
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,700
that truly unencrypted within the tunnel

403
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,349
itself this packet is the RPL RPL is the

404
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,780
routing protocol of autonomic network it

405
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,060
can never ever be seen outside of the

406
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,520
tunnel supposedly it totally should be

407
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,520
encrypted and never be seen we can see

408
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,020
such information here that we are using

409
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,529
GRE and some ESP and some stuff so

410
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:26,439
it appears to be going fine everything

411
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,529
seems to be good the encryption is or

412
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:31,509
whatever it is Dyck is a brand-new one

413
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,879
there are no attacks against it the

414
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,909
question comes is this technology really

415
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:37,570
secure

416
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,669
can we start deploying it can we start

417
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,860
putting it into action and see how we

418
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,570
can build networked in just ten minutes

419
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,879
and for that I thought about lights do

420
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,129
it try to do it live and see whether

421
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:52,750
they would withstand some of the attacks

422
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,000
that we have in mind or not and if we

423
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,250
have any problems I believe a life

424
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,120
support can help us so anything that

425
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,980
happens we will try to write to them and

426
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,600
see how it goes so the first idea I had

427
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,210
on my mind that while we are speaking

428
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,870
about they said that two different

429
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,100
devices from two different domains

430
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,289
cannot communicate together or at least

431
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:18,570
they will be neighbors

432
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,730
so what I'll try here even as a basic

433
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,559
thing is try to connect to a device

434
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,450
which is from a different domain and see

435
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,090
how it will be so this is from different

436
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,230
domain it's even it's a domain name is

437
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:38,230
malicious as we see here and my register

438
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:46,000
or my device is from domain from domain

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,169
or in W so supposedly they never should

440
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:51,730
be able to communicate together or at

441
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,009
least they will be neighbors so I try to

442
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,340
put this into test I get this I try to

443
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:04,929
connect water let's see how do we go so

444
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,700
I see they became neighbors well this is

445
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,450
expected and can even see that some

446
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,769
configuration is going back and forth

447
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,370
between them

448
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:26,740
and although this shouldn't be

449
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,280
we have built a tunnel we have built a

450
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
secure communication with the devices

451
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,390
within our domain come on we are

452
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,610
speaking about device which is somehow

453
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,010
maybe be a malicious it shouldn't belong

454
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,450
to my domain it shouldn't belong to my

455
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,600
network so what's this about whitelist

456
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,410
and what's this about everything I need

457
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,860
to write this to support hey I tried to

458
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,720
connect two devices from two different

459
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,760
domains and they communicated together

460
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,300
what do you think about that honestly

461
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,290
from Cisco perspective they were quite

462
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,520
responsive to all the random Edison's

463
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,410
that we have disclosed here then they

464
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,020
were quite fast enough to even to think

465
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,780
and just pass our request for the

466
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,380
business here

467
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,410
so the business unit the designers said

468
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,590
well you know what if they belong or

469
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,240
their certificate was signed by the same

470
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,660
CA they can join they can be in one

471
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,960
domain or they can communicate together

472
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,090
but come on this is not as spirit the

473
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,610
specifics this is something that we

474
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,330
didn't expect

475
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,580
yeah I don't make a big deal we would

476
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,350
just add this feature in the future

477
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,920
okay what's the significance of that if

478
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,420
the device has a certificate we never

479
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,300
check our whitelist so this device will

480
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,550
be always able to communicate or be

481
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,590
inside your network there is no way you

482
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,740
can stop such I think because this

483
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,040
certificate will always be rustic but

484
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,900
you know what what I can do usually

485
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:15,760
simply is I go to my register here and

486
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,710
just try to this is the domain name of

487
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,380
the server and just try to revoke the

488
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,690
certificate saying this certificate is

489
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,940
no longer valid

490
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,100
well I test it here on a local CA and

491
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,200
when I went to Cisco and said well I

492
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,650
tested here and it didn't work they said

493
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,170
to me you know we don't support it for

494
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,200
local CA I said but also I tested for

495
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,340
external see what do you think of that

496
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,029
they said okay oops this is a CV here

497
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:54,600
then sir what's the significance of such

498
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,200
a thing you cannot protect your network

499
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,330
you cannot revoke the certificates if

500
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,890
there is a device and all the device

501
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,990
from whatever from wherever it is that

502
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,480
has a valid certificate it can always be

503
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,429
part of your network if you'd like to

504
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:12,210
protect yourself you need to remove the

505
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,960
keys of your CA and make new ones that's

506
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,539
a flag hmm okay I see a little bit scary

507
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,909
but you know what I'm the one who has

508
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,580
control over my network I am the one who

509
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,279
controls my CA I generated the keys

510
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,240
privately and I don't care about such

511
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,279
problems as long as the communication is

512
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,520
stable that's all what I care about even

513
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,020
if we go to the register here

514
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,160
we can see that the communication has

515
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,020
been up for around three minutes here

516
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,830
when both you know three minutes here

517
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,890
three minutes here so I don't care about

518
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,970
such problems what can someone maybe do

519
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,410
what if someone tries to reset the

520
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:14,030
channel for you let's see

521
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,950
okay I see my device has been affected

522
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,900
but mmm okay this is not good

523
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,310
I see the interfaces are coming down

524
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,260
there is no longer secure or stable

525
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,900
connection anyone passing by can just

526
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,800
attack your nut Rick this is not good

527
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,410
let me check how long is something

528
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:46,690
changed yeah yeah they are done and

529
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,850
because we have here self-healing this

530
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,120
devices should not restart or try to

531
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,890
build the comb like bananas again on

532
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,760
their own but in other words anyone

533
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,430
passing by can just break the stability

534
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,580
of your connection we can see here that

535
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,530
the interfaces and stuff come up on its

536
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,050
own this is the idea of self-healing but

537
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,000
there is more here said like check your

538
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,830
work shark what's really scary about

539
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,330
this is this this is the RPL this is

540
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,690
what should have been encrypted so on

541
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,880
breaking your channel not only the

542
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,950
connection breaks but everything inside

543
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,140
that communication or secure channel is

544
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,890
sent in plaintext so there is no

545
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,200
encryption so no stability and no

546
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,090
encryption this is quite scary and as

547
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,770
usual we have the life support with us

548
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,920
read that something like the attacker

549
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,260
can reset the remote or secure channel

550
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,420
and can see everything in plaintext what

551
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,300
do you think yeah it's another CVA and

552
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:03,530
what so what's the problem of this we

553
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,090
store it into the face that you can

554
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,190
never have a stable secure connection

555
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,700
anymore but you know I still don't

556
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,740
believe in autonomous Network I believe

557
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,420
it just one problem that they can solve

558
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,640
although when you read the advisory from

559
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,800
Cisco for this vulnerability you will

560
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,110
find that they wrote the vulnerability

561
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,740
is due to unknown reasons and we don't

562
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,300
know how to solve it and we don't have a

563
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,920
workaround for that so it's

564
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,440
still like a zero-day attack so anyone

565
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,140
who they will solve it later you know

566
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,920
don't worry about it all what I'm afraid

567
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,960
about now is my devices at least are

568
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,310
running up unstable easily but for this

569
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:49,550
I have this small video and in this

570
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,840
video I just try to reset the channel

571
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,180
multiple times keep resetting the

572
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,570
channel one after another and if we see

573
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,260
here that I'm trying to ping after that

574
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,390
well this is a little bit scary because

575
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,340
it means that even the voices can crash

576
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,680
well I just try it I just wanted to put

577
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,680
it into test and see whether it will

578
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,160
withstand or not so I just enjoy

579
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,120
watching the video with you

580
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,530
this is what happens if you keep

581
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,179
resetting the channel multiple multiple

582
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,580
times this attack can take quite some

583
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,130
time around 15 to 20 minutes just to do

584
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,770
it but devices crash in the end I went

585
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,880
back to the life support come on sir

586
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,970
if the attacker kept resetting the

587
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,260
channel for multiple multiple times

588
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,590
eventually the device will crash and for

589
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:33,750
this we have another CVD so I just take

590
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,120
around 15 minutes to do it and up till

591
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,190
now it's the same problem for unknown

592
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,289
reasons and there is no workaround

593
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:45,380
around this and still valid attack but

594
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,750
no no at least autonomous mode that bad

595
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,480
you know I have my register which is

596
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,340
somehow the strongest device in my

597
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,490
network and no one can touch it right

598
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,990
yes yes let's go to my register here is

599
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,940
the register it has me not for how long

600
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,280
let me see it has me not for one hour

601
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,380
come on at least this is the strongest

602
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,090
thing in my network right and no I

603
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,870
cannot crash the register simply like

604
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:26,330
okay so this is not good

605
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:40,190
support sending space or not as the in

606
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,830
Rudi name will crush the register I

607
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,910
don't have anything more honestly

608
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,710
the register scratched the inner laser

609
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,490
crash so I'll just disable economic

610
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,350
networks sorry for that I don't have any

611
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:05,410
other option so this one is already that

612
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,180
so I've tried not to hear

613
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:21,020
well this is my new device I'll just you

614
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,950
know sorry I was just disable Network

615
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,669
I'm afraid of that

616
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,950
I'll just configure it as you configure

617
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,289
any normal device like I just give my

618
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:35,450
interface on ipv6 address and live in

619
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,140
peace something as simple as maybe like

620
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,200
this and even you know what I would just

621
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,700
go to my second device to us yeah I like

622
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,950
the technology but I need my devices

623
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,139
I'm sorry no autonomic too

624
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,010
and I just contribute normally

625
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
yeah

626
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,500
at least you know now I'm safe I'm safe

627
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,210
fine you're right it even for you guys

628
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,350
I'm safe

629
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,070
nothing can touch my devices nothing can

630
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,060
do any harm to my attack at least every

631
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:47,950
hopes so I haven't configured anything

632
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,940
on the new device except the ipv6 well

633
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,770
honestly this is my favourite attack I

634
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,330
like to call it the death case because

635
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,840
just one packet did destroy completely

636
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,480
your device crash it wherever you are

637
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,990
just knowing your ipv6 address will

638
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,180
crash your network for this in order to

639
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,760
protect either to upgrade to the new

640
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,100
operating system or the new iOS image or

641
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,130
just put an access list when each and

642
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,810
every interface even the new back

643
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,600
interfaces dropping anything coming on

644
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,380
port 4 9 36 or 4/8

645
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,870
else you'll always be vulnerable it's

646
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,560
not local

647
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,720
its global you can be here and crashing

648
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,060
people in Australia to conclude today's

649
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,220
presentation we have spoke about

650
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,260
economic network we spoke about these

651
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,750
three phases of the communication we

652
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,690
spoke about five on abilities here one

653
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,450
of them just need your ipv6 address no

654
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,610
further configuration nothing just to

655
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,140
totally crush it finally if you would

656
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,820
like to get your hands dirty work with

657
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,630
such stuff

658
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,670
I recommend wire edit is the first

659
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,280
application that used our analysis and

660
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,020
