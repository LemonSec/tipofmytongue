00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,080
hello i'm peter storey an assistant

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
professor at clark university i'm

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,839
presenting on behalf of our team from

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,240
carnegie mellon university of michigan

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,160
and the university of maryland

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,000
today i'll be presenting our paper

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,679
increasing adoption of torah browser

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
using informational and planning nudges

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,960
i think that one of the biggest

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
challenges in our community is getting

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,640
everyday people to actually use the

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
privacy enhancing technologies we create

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
for example consider tor browser a free

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
and effective tool for anonymous web

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,880
browsing

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,399
given that tor browser can protect

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,480
against many kinds of privacy threats

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,000
one might expect your browser to be

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
widely adopted

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,680
however work i presented at pets last

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
year showed that fewer than three

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
percent of survey respondents used tora

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,600
browser in the previous week

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,680
however this discrepancy shouldn't be

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
very surprising given what we know about

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
cognitive and behavioral biases

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,399
for example our results suggest that

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,600
people underestimate their

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
susceptibility to privacy risks and

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,359
underestimate the strength of tor

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,399
bowser's protections

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,799
research suggests that behavioral nudges

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,280
can help counter our biases

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
there are many types of nudges but we

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
deployed two types of nudges in our

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,680
study

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,360
we used a nudge based on protection

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
motivation theory

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,240
to help people for more accurate

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
perceptions of threats to their privacy

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
and to better understand how tor browser

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,439
can protect against those threats

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,880
we also used nudges based on

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
implementation intentions to help people

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
remember to use to our browser and to

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,840
overcome obstacles to using tor browser

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,119
we presented these nudges to

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,280
participants as part of an online survey

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
which i'll show in a few slides

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
at this point hopefully you have a sense

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,240
of why we want to increase adoption of

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,079
tor browser and how we hope to use

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,520
nudges to do that

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
we conducted a longitudinal field

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
experiment to test our nudges and i'll

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
describe the design of that experiment

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
next and then finally i'll describe the

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,798
results of our experiment

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,960
we recruited 537 participants for our

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
study using the prolific crowdsourcing

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
platform

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
we used a screening survey to recruit

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,758
participants we thought would be more

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
motivated to use toward browser and

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
specifically we selected participants

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
who expressed interest and protection

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
against the kinds of privacy threats

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
that tor browser can protect against

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
like preventing advertisers from seeing

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
the websites they visit

71
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
we also required participants to have

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,319
used another privacy enhancing

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
technology in the previous week

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,599
this chart shows the path of

75
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,440
participants through our study

76
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
we use survey 1 to recruit participants

77
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
and to filter out people who didn't meet

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
our screening criteria

79
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,720
thirty-seven percent of survey one

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
respondents met our screening criteria

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
and so were invited to survey two

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
in survey two we randomly assigned

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,760
participants to treatment conditions

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,519
in the control group participants were

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
not nudged to use tort browser

86
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,519
in the protection motivation theory only

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,200
group participants saw only the

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
pmt-based nunch

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
in the protection motivation theory plus

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
action planning condition participants

91
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
were also encouraged to form plans to

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
use tor browser in the week ahead

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
in survey 3 some participants in the pmt

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,120
plus action planning condition were also

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
shown a coping planning nudge designed

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,959
to help them overcome challenges to

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,879
using tor browser

98
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
in survey 3 4 and 5 we measured whether

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,040
participants had used torn browser

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
comparing usage rates between the

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
treatment groups showed us the effect of

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,000
our nudges

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
in the next slides i'll explain our

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
nudges in more detail

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,599
this text is part of our pmt-based nudge

106
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
it's primarily intended to influence

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
perceptions of threat susceptibility

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
although it also touches on threat

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
severity

110
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,159
we focused on salient well-defined

111
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
privacy threats from the literature and

112
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
we also described the limitations of the

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,760
tools participants might already be

114
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,599
familiar with so that participants

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,720
wouldn't think they were already

116
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
protected

117
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
our pmt nudge also included this text

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,760
which introduced participants to tor

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,599
browser and we assured them that it is

120
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,000
effective at protecting browsing privacy

121
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
then we explained how simple it is to

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,920
use tor browser we offered participants

123
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
the opportunity to install it we also

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,798
included an faq to debunk common

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,599
misconceptions

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
our action planning template encouraged

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
participants to use tor browser for up

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,080
to three privacy sensitive browsing

129
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
activities

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,199
the template helped people form and

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,520
mentally rehearse their plan in an if

132
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,199
then format

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
and it also included an opportunity for

134
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,720
participants to commit to their plan

135
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
we administered the production

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
motivation theory and action planning

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
treatments in survey 2.

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
after a week we followed up with survey

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
3. and in survey 3 we asked about use of

140
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
tor browser and about any challenges

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
encountered when trying to use it

142
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,479
for participants who are randomly

143
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,840
selected for the coping planning

144
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,759
condition we showed them a coping plan

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,440
template based on a challenge they

146
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
encountered if any

147
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
we designed plain templates

148
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
corresponding to websites being

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
extremely slow

150
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
websites not working and other types of

151
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,919
challenges described by participants

152
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
this plan corresponds to the most

153
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
commonly encountered challenge extreme

154
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
website slowness

155
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
the plan explains a possible source of

156
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,160
the problem

157
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
and a potential solution clicking the

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,800
new circuit button we also encourage

159
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
participants to mentally rehearse using

160
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,479
the new circuit button to fix this

161
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,880
problem

162
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
so to recap we administered the

163
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
treatments shown on the previous slides

164
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,479
over the course of multiple weeks we

165
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
measured the effect of the treatments by

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,919
comparing use of tor browser during

167
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
different treatment conditions in the

168
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,919
week following treatment administration

169
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,320
for example to determine the effect of

170
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
the protection motivation theory

171
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
treatment that we administered in survey

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
two in survey three we asked whether

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
participants had used torah browser in

174
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
the previous week

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,639
comparing usage rates between

176
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
participants in the control and pmt-only

177
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,840
groups revealed the effect of the pmt

178
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,360
treatment we found that our pmt-based

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
nudge made participants more likely to

180
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,600
use tor browser in the following week

181
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
this was a statistically significant

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
small sized effect

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
we also tested for a difference between

184
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
the pmt only and pmt plus action

185
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,680
planning treatments but this difference

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
was not statistically significant

187
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
we administered our coping planning

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
intervention in survey 3 to participants

189
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
who reported encountering challenges

190
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
using tor browser so we checked for an

191
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
effect the following week by analyzing

192
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
the survey for data

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
in our analysis we focused on those who

194
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,759
encountered challenges since only those

195
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,520
participants were eligible to complete

196
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
coping plans

197
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
our data showed that our coping planning

198
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
intervention made participants 2.6 times

199
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,199
more likely to use tor browser in the

200
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,160
following week a medium-sized effect and

201
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
this difference was statistically

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
significant

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
in addition to measuring whether our

204
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
interventions would increase adoption of

205
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
tor browser in the subsequent week we

206
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
also wanted to know whether they would

207
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
have effects in the long term

208
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
so three weeks after survey four we

209
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
invited participants to respond to

210
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
survey five adult survey five was

211
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
optional over ninety percent of the

212
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,240
participants who completed our

213
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
experiment also completed survey five

214
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,160
even five weeks later the pmt based

215
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
treatment still had an effect with

216
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,919
participants in the pmt only condition

217
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
more than twice as likely to use tor

218
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
browser those in the control group

219
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
however we no longer saw an effect from

220
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
our coping planning based intervention

221
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
to summarize we found that our

222
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
protection motivation theory based nudge

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,919
resulted in both short and long term

224
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,240
increases in tor browser use

225
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
however our action planning based nudge

226
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
didn't significantly affect people's use

227
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
of war browser

228
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
since we recruited participants who are

229
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
already familiar with private browsing

230
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,879
and vpns they might have already been in

231
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,879
the habit of using privacy tools for

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
privacy sensitive tasks

233
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,879
so future work could investigate whether

234
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
our action plans might be more helpful

235
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
to less tech savvy people

236
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
and finally although we found that our

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
coping planning-based nudge resulted in

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
a short-term increase in tour browser

239
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
use we didn't see an effect after

240
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,759
several

241
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,280
weeks had passed

242
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,720
and the temporary increase might have

243
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
been due to people testing out their

244
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,919
coping plans

245
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,520
so although the coping plans may not

246
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,160
have increased use of tor browser they

247
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
might have helped people use tor browser

248
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
more effectively so future work should

249
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,720
explore this

250
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
as part of our action planning treatment

251
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
we encourage participants to list

252
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
privacy sensitive activities that might

253
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
use torah browser for

254
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,640
231 participants heard a total of 598

255
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
activities

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
most commonly people wrote that they

257
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
preferred not to disclose the activity

258
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,839
so in these cases we can't tell the

259
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,680
nature of the activity or even if the

260
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
participant had something in mind

261
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,440
and since participants might be less

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
likely to disclose more sensitive

263
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
activities the frequencies of the

264
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
activities are informative for showing

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
the diversity of different activities

266
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
we coded almost 30 different activities

267
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,560
so i'll just give examples of four of

268
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
the most common

269
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
55 activities were about shopping for

270
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
example one participant described

271
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,120
browsing for gifts for my fiance

272
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
49 activities were about financial

273
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,959
activities for example another

274
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,320
participant described mortgage shopping

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
it was also common for people to

276
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,920
describe reading the news

277
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
finally some participants described

278
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
using tor boxer to access not safe for

279
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,720
work content like pornography

280
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
the variety of activities that our

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
participants described shows that people

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
can have many different reasons for

283
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
using tor browser

284
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
in survey 3 we asked participants who

285
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
tried to use tor browser what challenges

286
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
if any they'd encountered when trying to

287
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
do so

288
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
more than half of participants reported

289
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
encountering some form of challenge

290
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
most commonly people described

291
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
encountering extremely slow websites

292
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,279
participants in our coping planning

293
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,200
condition who selected this challenge

294
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
were given the plan template i showed

295
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
earlier which explained how to use the

296
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,839
new circuit button

297
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
all 26 participants we showed this plan

298
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
filled it out

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,519
when we followed up a week later half

300
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
reported having clicked the new circuit

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
button in the elapsed time

302
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
although we didn't directly measure the

303
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,959
efficacy of people's plans several

304
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
participants confirmed that their plans

305
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
helped them overcome challenges

306
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,200
for example one participant wrote that

307
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
clicking on new circuit for the site

308
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,920
works it was a definite help with faster

309
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,719
loading speeds

310
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,320
in conclusion

311
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
we found that our nudge based on

312
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
protection motivation theory increased

313
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
people's use of tor browser even after

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,279
five weeks

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
this suggests that tor browser is

316
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
meeting a need for people and that

317
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
outside of our study tour browser

318
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
adoption can increase significantly from

319
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
where it is today

320
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
however participants commonly

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
encountered challenges using tor browser

322
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
like websites being extremely slow or

323
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
blocking tor browser users

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
and although neither are action or

325
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
coping planning nudges increased use of

326
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
tor browser in the long term that might

327
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
still help people use tor browser more

328
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
effectively so future work should

329
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,120
investigate this

330
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
finally we showed that people want to

331
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
use tor browser for a variety of benign

332
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
activities like online shopping and

333
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
reading the news

334
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
to the extent that website operators can

335
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
improve the usability of their sites in

336
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
tor browser they should do so

337
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
a good first step is to simply try

338
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
loading the website you're responsible

339
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
for in tor browser to see what the user

340
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
experience is like

341
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
as tour browser becomes more popular

342
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
websites that work in tor browser are

343
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
going to have a competitive advantage
