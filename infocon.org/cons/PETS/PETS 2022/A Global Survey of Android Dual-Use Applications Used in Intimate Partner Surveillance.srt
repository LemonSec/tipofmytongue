1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,140
foreign

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,600
ER or current ultimate partner such as

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
wife husband spouse boyfriend or

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,060
girlfriends ipv is a serious issue that

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,680
affects people everywhere around the

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,519
world

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,279
in fact one among every three women

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
experience ipv globally

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,920
and ipv is actually a major cause of

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,239
death for women

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,579
unfortunately the numbers have increased

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,079
significantly during the pandemic

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,420
because of stay at home orders

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,879
note that ipv is an issue that affects

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,680
all people regardless of their age

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,000
language race and gender

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,620
unfortunately abusers are exploiting

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,840
technology to conduct ipv as shown by

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,020
prior work and news articles

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,480
abusers exploit technology to spy on

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,520
their Partners locations calls and more

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,040
as well as to harvest and intimidate

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
victims and this work we will focus on

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
intimate partner surveillance or IPS in

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,700
short

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,040
which is the use of technology to spy on

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,439
intimate partners

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,780
with technology IPS can be easily

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,820
conducted and the users are installing

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,860
applications or smartphones and tablets

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,560
that allow them to inspire on victims

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,960
these apps are available in official app

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,960
stores such as Google plays and can be

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,900
easily downloaded we call these apps you

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,060
would use apps because they are designed

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,520
for legitimate use case such as to track

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,840
your own devices

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,939
but they can be easily repurposed by

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,979
abusers for IPs

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,920
for example find my device app can be

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,600
installed on the victim's device and

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,579
used by the abuser to track the victims

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,360
location

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
although the app was not designed for

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,619
spying

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,780
prior work have studied English you will

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,180
use apps found in the US however since

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,100
ipv workers everywhere around the world

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,500
it is important to expand our knowledge

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,960
Beyond English and the US

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,899
we ask what types of dual use apps

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,459
available in languages other than

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,720
English

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,180
and are these apps easily found in other

55
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,800
languages

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,020
in this work we investigate you will use

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,319
apps available in other languages

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,540
our work is the first Global measurement

59
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,239
study in dual user apps we crawled Play

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,700
Store using 15 popular spoken languages

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,459
supported by the store

62
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,620
we found that Play Store does not always

63
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,360
block queries that mention IPS

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,239
explicitly under the store suggests IPS

65
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,180
queries in some languages

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,360
we found more than 800 dual use apps and

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
estimate that our data set contains

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,940
about 4000 dual users

69
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,500
we also found that Julius apps are

70
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,440
localized more often than other apps

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,800
finally due to new policies by Google

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,319
apps do not promote IPS anymore but they

73
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,120
still provide the same IPS capabilities

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,000
found by firework

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,239
we first present our crawling pipeline

76
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,420
we prepared seed queries in 15 languages

77
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,700
these languages were chosen based on the

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,319
number of native speakers and whether

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,620
the language is supported by Play Store

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,140
for each language we relied on native

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,440
speakers to create seed queries

82
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
we expanded our set of queries by

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760
collecting queries suggested by the

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,780
store

85
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,599
we found more than new 6000 queries in

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,099
total

87
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,440
using the final set of queries we called

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,019
the store and collected apps for 47 days

89
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,480
in 2020.

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,819
we collected more than 50 000 unique

91
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,739
apps in total

92
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,720
a lot of these apps were not in English

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
so we used Google Translate to translate

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,120
the metadata of non-engling shops

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,980
then we applied the machine learning

96
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,739
classifier to remove relevant apps

97
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,200
finally we manually labeled more than

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,700
3000 apps and found 854 dual use apps we

99
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,439
estimate that our data set has around

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,439
4000 dual use apps

101
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,780
we observe several interesting patterns

102
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,700
in the suggested queries and apps found

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,699
on Google Play in different languages

104
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,380
first

105
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,660
we analyzed IPS queries and how the

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,280
store handles them

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,979
by IPS queries we mean queries that

108
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,080
explicitly talk about intimate partner

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,300
surveillance

110
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,680
unfortunately Play Store suggests many

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
IPS queries as seen in this example

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,320
we found that Play Store suggests

113
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
specific queries in nine languages

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,919
including English

115
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,860
for Malay Portuguese and Spanish a store

116
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,320
suggested more than 30 explicit IPS

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,699
queries

118
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,680
Malay has the highest number of ips

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,340
queries we found 97 IPS queries in total

120
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,820
in Malay

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
while IPS queries are suggested

122
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,660
sometimes we found that the store blocks

123
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,880
some IPS queries such as track my

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,259
husband

125
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,500
foreign was mostly observed in English

126
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,320
with 22 blocked queries which is due to

127
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,500
new protections against ipv by Google

128
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,840
however we found that these protections

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,900
are not applied equally across languages

130
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,300
for example when translating trunk my

131
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,820
husband to Vietnamese you will get many

132
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,800
relevant results

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,740
we found that for nine languages no IPS

134
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,600
queries were blocked

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,060
for other languages only less than 10

136
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,020
queries were blocked

137
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,580
we found that IPS query blocking a

138
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,320
suggestion is not uniform across

139
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
languages

140
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,460
we did not find any language where all

141
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,860
IPS queries are blocked and not new IPS

142
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,720
queries are suggested

143
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,820
this is in fact the best case scenario

144
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,380
and what should be done

145
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,840
no IPS query should be should be

146
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,360
suggested to users and all IPS queries

147
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,880
must be blocked

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
now we will look into our analysis of

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,020
dual use apps

150
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,660
we found that apps do not promote IPS

151
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
explicitly anymore

152
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,860
instead they promote things like like

153
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,560
tracking your children

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,900
this change is caused by new policies by

155
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,840
women however abusers can still find

156
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
relevant results and the same powerful

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,979
capabilities shown by prior work

158
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,500
we noticed that IPS capabilities are

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,440
distributed differently across languages

160
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,120
here we show the highest and lowest

161
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,979
fractions of tool used apps with

162
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,560
specific capability across languages

163
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,199
for example some dual use apps allow you

164
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,020
to access the camera or microphone of

165
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,539
the victim's device anytime

166
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,060
these apps with access capabilities are

167
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,759
rarely found using handy queries however

168
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,560
you have the highest chance of finding

169
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,560
them using vitamins

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,360
you may refer to the paper for more

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,340
details about how capabilities are

172
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,319
distributed

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,479
we also looked at whether apps are

174
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,460
easily findable by querying multiple

175
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,660
languages

176
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,819
on the left you can see that magnitude

177
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,560
will use apps are found when searching

178
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,460
using two or more languages in fact 77

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,800
percent of dual use apps are found using

180
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,599
at least two languages

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
and 27 percent of the Julius apps are

182
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,919
not found using English queries

183
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,240
compared to an average app it's easier

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,099
to find your news apps by querying

185
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,900
multiple languages

186
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,300
similarly we looked at the localization

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,680
of dual users

188
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
by localization we mean whether the

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,639
metadata of apps is available in

190
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,620
multiple languages

191
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,539
you can see that Julius apps are

192
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,599
localized more often than an average app

193
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,440
47 of Julius apps are localized to at

194
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
least two languages

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,120
and 17 percent of dual news apps are not

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
localized to English

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,780
this means that by looking at more

198
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,639
languages we can't cover more you will

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,080
use apps

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,940
we looked at apps found in the Play

201
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,919
Store but there are more official

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,419
Android stores

203
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,819
so what about these stores can abusers

204
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,180
find dual use apps there easily

205
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,400
to answer this we called four popular

206
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,259
Chinese stores

207
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,180
we put Chinese stores because Google

208
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,979
Play is blocked in China

209
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,800
and since many users speak many Android

210
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,780
users speak Chinese we considered

211
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,720
crawling stores accessible in China

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,320
we collected a total of

213
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,200
2484 unicups after plugging all these

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,458
apps we found only 110 Julius apps

215
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,159
only 17 of these apps are found in Play

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
Store

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,120
and only 13 are available in at least

218
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,500
two Chinese stones

219
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,640
We compare the results from crawling

220
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,740
Chinese stores to the results obtained

221
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,480
from crawling Play Store using Chinese

222
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,860
queries

223
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,140
we found that the probability of finding

224
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,300
a jewelries app using Chinese queries in

225
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,580
Play Store is three times higher than

226
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,860
the probability of finding new news apps

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,540
and the four Chinese stores before

228
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,279
we also noticed that the distribution of

229
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,260
capabilities is different between Play

230
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,959
Store and Chinese stores for example

231
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,700
our users have a better chance of

232
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,620
finding out the recording capabilities

233
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,200
in Chinese stores but a lower chance of

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
finding apps that share data from the

235
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
device

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,959
we believe that these differences are

237
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,839
are caused by differences in searching

238
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,180
algorithms and popularity of these

239
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,940
stores among Developers

240
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,519
so comparing our results to the 2018

241
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,760
study what did change first

242
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,700
83 percent of Julius apps found by prior

243
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,200
work got deleted

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
we don't know whether they were listed

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,700
by Google or by developers but these

246
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,980
apps are not available anymore

247
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,740
also in our crowd we found only three

248
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,620
apps that mentioned IPS explicitly this

249
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,240
apps were reported to Google for

250
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,100
violating policies

251
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,920
finally we call Play Store this year

252
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,860
again for one day we estimate that more

253
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,959
than 2 000 apps are found in our last

254
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,200
scroll in 2022.

255
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,480
we noticed that dual use apps get

256
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
deleted frequently but newer Jewelers

257
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,740
app get uploaded in place of the old

258
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,660
ones

259
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,240
to summarize record Play Store and 15

260
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,640
languages searching for dual users

261
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
we found that Google Play does not

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,140
always block IPS queries and suggest IPS

263
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,180
queries in some languages

264
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,760
we also found that some dual use apps

265
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,160
are not found using English queries

266
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,019
and that manageable use apps are

267
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,579
localized to

268
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,459
multiple languages

269
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,740
finally although you will use apps are

270
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,680
not promoting IPS anymore abusers can

271
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,660
still find powerful capabilities that

272
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,600
allow them to conduct IPS

273
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,640
future work can investigate how to

274
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
detect whether adoles app is getting

275
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
abused or not

276
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,120
since deleting these apps from stores is

277
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,040
not possible as they have legitimate use

278
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,940
cases

279
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,160
also future work can explore whether

280
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
developers are promoting IPS outside

281
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,079
official stores

282
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,640
if you have any questions or comments

283
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,800
you can ask now or feel free to contact

284
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,200
me at the email shown on the screen

285
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,339
thank you for listening
