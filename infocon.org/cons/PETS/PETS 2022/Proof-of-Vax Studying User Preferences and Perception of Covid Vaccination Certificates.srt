00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,720
hi my name is marvin and i'm a phd

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,559
student from the royal university bohm

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,920
in germany

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,920
essentially my main research area is

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,160
human-centered security and privacy of

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
kovit-19 apps in the following minutes i

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,279
would like to present our paper called

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
proof of x studying user preferences and

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,279
perception of kovi vaccination

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,519
certificates

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,880
i'm pretty sure that most of you heard

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
about kf19 apps to fight the ongoing

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
pandemic the best known example are

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,120
probably contact tracing apps intended

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
to break infection chains more

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,000
effectively

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
and the use of these types of mobile

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,399
apps

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,760
is usually on a voluntary basis

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
and as most of you probably know there

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,960
are several studies out there that

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,719
already investigated the end user's

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
privacy perception of such apps

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
despite these digital tools and other

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
measures we have had recurring lockdowns

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
and other restrictions which affect the

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,360
social life freedom of travel and many

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,960
many more areas

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,640
this already caused severe damage to the

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
global economy

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
then as the pandemic progressed several

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,280
kobe 19 vaccines have been developed and

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
with the appearance of these vaccines

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
they're also raised in some countries

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
such as germany discussions about

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
privileges for vaccinated citizens for

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
example to allow participating in major

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,640
events or international air travelling

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
to verify the vaccination status covet

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
vaccination certificates are required

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
and thus vaccination certificates may

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
help to prevent further lockdowns and in

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,040
limiting the spread of the coronavirus

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,119
this emerging field of application

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
motivated us to take a deeper look at

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
the privacy perception and the user

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,240
acceptance of different implementations

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
of vaccination certificates and their

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,759
scope of usage

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,680
we did this by conducting an end-user

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
study in germany being particularly

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,119
interested in studying the willingness

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
to use of paper-based and app-based

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
certificates

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
this area of research gives us deeper

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,560
insights into the privacy of digital

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
health related data and apps especially

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
because these certificates store and

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
show sensitive personal health data

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,840
and finally investigating the

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
willingness to use of kovit-19 apps can

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
prepare us for future applications of x

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,840
certificates and the design of held apps

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
in general

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,800
to better understand the context of our

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
study and to motivate the reason to

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
conduct our study in a european country

68
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
in germany i would like to give you a

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
brief overview of the pandemic situation

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,440
in germany in this case as of march 2021

71
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
so about one year after the pandemic

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
started

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
there already existed some cop19 apps in

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
germany such as the popular government

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
developed coronavir app used for contact

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,119
tracing

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,959
at the time of our study germany was in

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
a strict second lockdown

79
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
lasting multiple month

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
this lockdown included closed shopping

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
stores restaurants and travel

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
restrictions

83
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
there are no privileges or any kind of

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
withdrawal of restrictions for

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
vaccinated citizens but discussions

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,800
about societal implications of

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
privileges

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
to give you some more numbers for

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
context only 4.5 percent of the german

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,599
population had been fully vaccinated due

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
to limited access to vaccine

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
and at the time of our study after each

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,319
vaccination is given most countries

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
including germany issued a paper-based

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
proof of

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
for example deposited within the

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,879
official international certificates of

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,720
vaccination document

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,920
standardized by the world health

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
organization

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
this official yellow document is already

102
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
used and recognized by many countries

103
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,879
and i'm confident that many of you

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
probably know this kind of document

105
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
so there was only the paper-based

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
evidence for the purpose of

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
documentation

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,920
and we have designed five different

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
variants of x certificates based on

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
deployed or planned designs of

111
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,440
paper-based and app-based variants

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,280
to evaluate the ringless to use of our

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
certificates within specific use cases

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
we conducted a representative online

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,080
study in germany on a sample of 599

116
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
participants

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
let's briefly talk about the design and

118
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
the structure of our questionnaire in

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
total our study consists of four

120
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
different question groups in the main

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
part of our study the third item in this

122
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
list we investigated the willingness to

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
use of these fact certificates within

124
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,839
two use cases

125
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
before i will talk about our use cases i

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,440
would like to explain our five different

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,400
conditions or variants of certificates

128
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
the first one is a simple piece of

129
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
credit card sized paper confirming the

130
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,960
vaccination against kovite 19.

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
the second one is the existing

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,919
international certificates of

133
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
vaccination document used to confirm and

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
verify the vaccination status of several

135
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
vaccinations that took place

136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
so both variants are paper-based and

137
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,639
differ only in the degree of

138
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
specialization

139
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
the covet certificate app is based on a

140
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
planned eu digital vaccination

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,360
certificate utilizing a

142
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
cryptographically signed qr code which

143
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
can be easily verified by scanning to

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
check the vaccination status

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
c4 is based on the health insurance apps

146
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
on the design of health insurance apps

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
which are gradually introduced in

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,960
germany and further european countries

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
to digitize the patient's record also

150
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,759
including vaccination records

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
and finally c5 the already existing

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
coronavan app extended by the vex

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,440
certificate feature

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,600
so we designed five different between

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,080
group conditions representing different

156
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
variants of certificates which means

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
that calculated on our nearly 600

158
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
participants 120 participants each have

159
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,719
seen a single back certificate

160
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
in our questionnaire a single web

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
certificate has two different within

162
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
group use cases

163
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,560
within the first use case documentation

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
only it is assumed that the respective

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
certificate is used for documentation

166
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
purposes only

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
as you probably noticed the first use

168
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
case represents the situation in germany

169
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,120
at the time of our study

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
our second use case covers a future

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
scenario where these certificates are

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
mandatory for privileges

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,240
each participant got to see only one

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
condition but in chronological order

175
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,479
both use cases

176
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
and each condition and use case within

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
our survey consists of a short

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
descriptive text about the use case and

179
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
the purpose of the respective fx

180
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,360
certificate

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
and is finally supplemented by a

182
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,240
visualized mock-up design

183
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,120
okay let's now finally talk about the

184
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,440
most important results of our paper

185
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
in the first step we will take a look at

186
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,880
the participant's willingness to use of

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
all five certificates each rated on a

188
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,039
five point scale

189
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
in the documentation use case we observe

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
that the response values so the overall

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
willingness to use is generally high

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
across all conditions

193
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
this means that there are tendencies for

194
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
the participants to use any variant of

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,319
certificate

196
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
most strikingly we observe the highest

197
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,479
willingness to use for both paper-based

198
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,479
variants

199
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
we also found pairwise statistically

200
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,199
highly significant differences between

201
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,440
each of the paper-based conditions c1

202
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
and c2 compared to the app-based

203
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
conditions c3 4 and 5.

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,840
this means that both paper-based

205
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,759
variants reach significant higher

206
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,759
preference rates than each of their base

207
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
counterparts

208
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
so for the documentation use case many

209
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
participants seem to value the existing

210
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
certificate as sufficient

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
but if we change the use case so

212
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
assuming privileges for vaccinated

213
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,319
citizens we observe two significant

214
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
changes

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
first the significant differences

216
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,800
between paper and ad-based certificates

217
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
is no longer present except for

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
condition c4 the health insurance app

219
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
this implies that the health insurance

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
app is the only app that has a

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,639
significant negative impact on the

222
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
willingness to use and thus allow user

223
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
acceptance rate compared compared to

224
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
both paper-based variants

225
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
second the overall willingness to use

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
for vaccination certificates is still

227
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
relatively high but decreases

228
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,120
significantly compared to the

229
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
documentation use case

230
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,840
and we suspect that this is related to

231
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,599
the more invasive intervention caused by

232
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
specific privileges only given to

233
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,639
vaccinate

234
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
vaccinated individuals

235
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
but what are the factors influencing the

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,520
participants willingness to use

237
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
to answer this question we conducted a

238
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
covariance analysis respectively for

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
both use cases

240
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,958
let's first take a look at predictors

241
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
that positively influence oral english

242
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,679
to use text certificates that is being

243
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,360
more concerned about becoming infected

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
with the coronavirus

245
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
the same applies in case of having a

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
positive attitude towards covet-19

247
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
vaccinations

248
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,519
participants who already use the german

249
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,360
coronavenep are also more likely to use

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,600
vex certificates

251
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
but we also found factors that

252
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
negatively influence the willingness to

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
use

254
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
participants being in an app-based

255
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,880
condition are less willing to use a vex

256
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
certificate than participants who have

257
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,480
seen a paper-based variant

258
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
the second factor that also reduces

259
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
rulings to use is our participants

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,839
privacy disposition

261
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
participants who are more sensitive

262
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
about their personal data handling or

263
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,760
value health data as especially worthy

264
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
of protection are also less willing to

265
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
use any variance of certificates in both

266
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
use cases

267
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
this effect is slightly stronger for the

268
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
documentation use case

269
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
for deeper understanding of the reasons

270
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
that affect the willingness to use vex

271
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
certificates we also viewed our

272
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,800
participants open-ended responses

273
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,360
in fact we asked them for reasons why or

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,560
why they would not use these

275
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
certificates

276
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
participants who have a more positive

277
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,920
attitude towards vaccination

278
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
certificates argue that those

279
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
certificates might help to contain the

280
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,839
covet-19 pandemic or prevent further

281
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
lockdowns

282
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
others refer to the intent to protect

283
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
themselves or others from the

284
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,839
coronavirus

285
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
on the other hand some participants who

286
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
are not willing to use any variant of x

287
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
certificate are afraid of discrimination

288
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
a to class society or even indirect

289
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
vaccination obligation

290
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
surprisingly the highest number of

291
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,640
critical responses within the app groups

292
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,680
relate to general privacy concerns quote

293
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,480
i'm concerned about data protection or

294
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
excessive data collection on personal

295
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
devices quote

296
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,680
i do not need any more data collection

297
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,839
on my

298
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,040
smartphone some participants are even

299
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
more specific and argue that they do not

300
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
want sensitive health data stored on

301
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,199
their phones

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
within our app based conditions around

303
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,320
34 percent of the open answers stated

304
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
privacy concerns but none of our

305
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
participants argue with privacy concerns

306
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,600
or the protection of sensitive

307
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
information when using any variant of a

308
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,519
paper-based certificate

309
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
most of the privacy concerns opposed for

310
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
the more generalized health insurance

311
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
app and fused privacy concerns are

312
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,760
mentioned in the covet certificate

313
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
condition

314
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
this also corresponds with the estimates

315
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
of our covariance analysis where apps

316
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,959
are our biggest negative predictor

317
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
and to conclude vaccination certificates

318
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
are considered by our participants as an

319
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,440
effective means to fight the govet-19

320
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
pandemic and to prevent further

321
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
lockdowns

322
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
second paper-based solutions receive

323
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
more positive responses compared to

324
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
app-based solutions and to finish the

325
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
conclusion we identified privacy as a

326
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
key factor and recommend appropriate

327
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
handling of sensitive health data for

328
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
the design of fax apps

329
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,640
thank you for your attention and i hope

330
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
that you are inspired by some of the

331
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,040
insights of privacy in case of vex apps

332
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,439
and health data
