00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,799
hi my name is nora omar and in this

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,799
presentation i'll be talking about our

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,639
work that investigated the privacy

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,160
compliance processes followed by

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,480
developers of child directed apps this

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,559
is joint work with my advisor dr serge

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,400
again

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,240
the research studies continue to uncover

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
a range of potential privacy violations

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
that render mobile apps retention and

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,439
uncompliant with applicable privacy

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,760
regulations this includes collecting

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
personal data to be used for prohibited

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,519
purposes without having legal bases

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
under applicable privacy laws

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,920
at the same time countries continue to

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
enact privacy regulations with

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
similarities and differences in their

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,600
legal requirements

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
despite ongoing research and regulatory

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
efforts we are yet to answer three

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
questions why do privacy issues continue

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
to persist how effective developers

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
compliance processes are and how can

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
such a processes be improved

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
since the kids provisions of privacy

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
regulations the united states and europe

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
are known to be more stringent than the

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
provisions that apply to general

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,960
audiences we believe that studying the

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,879
privacy compliance processes followed by

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,640
developers of child directed apps

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
presents an opportunity for

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
understanding how to make policy efforts

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
more effective

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
copper gdpr and the ccpa are privacy

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
laws that have provisions that protect

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,840
child users in the us or the eu

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
kappa applies to users under the age of

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,640
13 whereas gdpr protects users under the

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
age of 16. under kappa developers are

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
required to obtain verifiable parental

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,119
consent without collecting or

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,880
transmitting data from children to third

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
parties similarly under gdpr if consent

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
is relied upon as a legal basis it has

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
to be provided or approved by a guardian

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
for ccpa verifiable parental consent is

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,399
needed before opting in users under the

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
age of 13 to certain data processing

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,200
activities however users between 13 and

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
16 may consent and those over 16 years

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,880
of age must request to be opted out

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
the three privacy laws also have

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
transparency requirements that require

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
developers to disclose the types of data

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,719
their apps collect as well as the kind

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,719
of third parties that receive users data

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,000
and the purposes of their data

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,399
collection and sharing activities

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,239
other privacy rights that users are

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,840
provided with include the ability to

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
withdraw their consent and acquire about

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
how the data was used or request the

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
deletion of their data

66
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
to understand the efforts made by

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
developers of child directed apps to

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
comply with privacy regulations we

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
started by deploying a survey to

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,879
understand organizational privacy

71
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
practices to developers who published

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,959
apps on the google play store

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
the results of this survey inspired us

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
to design a second survey for personnel

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
within the developer organizations

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,959
however the data we collected after

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,640
deploying the two surveys was not

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
sufficient for understanding compliance

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,599
processes

80
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,800
and that's the reason why we

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
subsequently recruited app developers

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
for semi-structured interviews

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
we additionally analyzed developers apps

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
and compared the results of app testing

85
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
with developers responses to our surveys

86
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
and interview questions

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
in the two surveys we focused on

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
understanding developers awareness of

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
their apps behaviors whether they have

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
formal processes for compliance and for

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,159
vetting third party code for inclusion

92
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
in their apps whether they are familiar

93
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
with applicable privacy laws and their

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
perceptions of their compliance

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
obligations

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
whether and how they obtain parental

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
consent before collecting personal data

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,239
from child users their experiences with

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
the google play store policies and the

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
challenges they experience when trying

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,840
to comply with applicable privacy

102
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
laws in our follow-up interviews we

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
discussed with participants their

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
compliance processes presented them with

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,959
some of the results of our testing of

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
their abs and observed how they reacted

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
to our findings

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
for that we needed to do some

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
preparation prior to each interview

110
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,319
session we used some of their apps like

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
a child would by not unlocking

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
functionality only available to adult

113
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
users such as parents we looked for

114
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
transmissions of personal data and

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
whether parental consent is obtained

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
prior to that without their privacy

117
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,599
policies and we also looked for

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
indicators of third-party sdk compliance

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,920
misconfigurations

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
in order to identify sdkms

121
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000
configurations we needed to test some of

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
the sdks used in child directed apps we

123
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
integrated the sdks and test apps that

124
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,199
we created and then use their compliance

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,440
configurations like developers would

126
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,759
the configurations could be server-side

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
configurations like the one unity ads

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,080
has on their dashboard

129
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
or client-side configurations such as

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
this coil snippet that google admob asks

131
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
developers to use so that ad requests

132
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,360
receive child-directed treatment

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
after that we looked at the

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
transmissions generated from a test apps

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
to identify indicators of whether the

136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
compliance settings were used then we

137
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
looked for the same indicators and

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
developers apps and discussed our

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
findings with the participants

140
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
we found that most developers believe

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,560
that their privacy policies disclosed

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,320
all the data collection and transmission

143
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
behaviors of their apps however our

144
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
testing showed that 17 of them had

145
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,639
published ads that transmitted

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
identifiers to third parties also

147
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
although 60 believe that obtaining

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,919
parental consent is important only 36

149
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
percent said they did so across all

150
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
their apps prior to data collection

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
when we tested their apps however we

152
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,919
found that none of them had implemented

153
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,680
verifiable mechanisms for obtaining

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,919
parental consent we also found

155
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,520
developers who used simple knowledge

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
based questions or age gates that could

157
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
be bypassed by children

158
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
all of which don't meet the legal

159
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
requirement of verifiable parental

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
consent under applicable privacy laws or

161
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
the ftc

162
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,800
despite that we found that many

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
developers demonstrated understanding of

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
the importance of obtaining parental

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
consent

166
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
those who believed that they did not

167
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
need to obtain parental consent provided

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
explanations such as saying that their

169
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
apps are not dangerous that the data

170
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
collection is done by sdks or that the

171
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,039
store is responsible for evaluating the

172
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
apps before making them available to

173
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
users

174
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
during our interviews when we discuss

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
that parental consent needs to be

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,479
verifiable we observe that there is a

177
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,240
general lack of awareness of this legal

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,479
requirement with participants explaining

179
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
that it's the responsibility of parents

180
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
or app stores to verify that consent is

181
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,679
obtained from guardians

182
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
the results of our organizational survey

183
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
also showed that 42 did not have

184
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
processes for addressing privacy issues

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
during the software development

186
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
lifecycle

187
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
our survey results also showed that most

188
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
developers claim familiarity with kappa

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,919
and gdpr on the ccpa

190
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
most believe that they are required to

191
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,199
comply with them

192
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
and also believe that all their abs are

193
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
compliant

194
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
in our second survey we also asked

195
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,199
personnel within the developer

196
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
organizations about their familiarity

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
with the three privacy laws in addition

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
to the california privacy rights act

199
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
cpra which will replace the ccpa

200
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
we found that survey respondents were

201
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,840
more familiar with copper and gdpr

202
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,639
compared to ccpa and cpra

203
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,960
however 23 percent of respondents

204
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
claimed familiarity with a fictitious

205
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
privacy lawyer called flerpa which we

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
added as a quality control

207
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,560
although this finding was surprising to

208
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
us it might show the level of

209
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
uncertainty of developers and their

210
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
compliance obligations given the

211
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,880
complexity of the privacy compliance

212
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
landscape and that developers might not

213
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
have access to legal expertise

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,400
we also asked respondents about how they

215
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
determine the privacy laws that are

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,919
applicable to them and found that 52

217
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
percent of them rely on google play as

218
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,799
their source for guidance

219
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,039
for example one of them mentioned google

220
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
routinely verify the respective copper

221
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,479
they send notifications in case of

222
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
violations so we can fix them

223
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
we also found that only eight percent

224
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
believe that privacy compliance is not a

225
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
challenge for them

226
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,440
as for their level of concern regarding

227
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
the consequences of not complying with

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,080
privacy regulations 68 believe that they

229
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
are unlikely to be investigated by

230
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,879
regulators

231
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
and 45 percent were concerned about the

232
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
removal of their apps from the store

233
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
we examined whether developers are more

234
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
concerned about the removal of their

235
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
apps from the store compared to being

236
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
investigated by regulators and found the

237
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
result to be statistically significant

238
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,599
this highlights the major role that app

239
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
stores play in privacy compliance

240
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,080
as for privacy compliance processes we

241
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
found that many developers simply

242
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
decided to not collect any data from

243
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
their users to comply with all

244
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
applicable privacy regulations with some

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,879
developers indicating uncertainty about

246
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,560
the behaviors of third party sdks

247
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
integrating in their own apps

248
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,720
others just assume that their apps are

249
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,080
in compliance since they have not been

250
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,799
rejected by the store

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,200
as for how third-party sdks are selected

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,279
22 percent said that they don't use

253
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,760
third-party sdks at all

254
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,839
twenty percent check sdk documentation

255
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,519
for information about the types of data

256
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,279
sdks collect before deciding to

257
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,519
integrate them

258
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,440
ten percent said they only use sdks

259
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
listed in google's list of certified

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
sdks

261
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
and ten percent only use sdks they trust

262
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,080
to be in in compliance

263
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
in our follow-up survey we found that

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
only 31 had the processes to wet

265
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
third-party sdks for inclusion in their

266
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,480
apps with some participants explaining

267
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
that they lack relevant expertise

268
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
others trusting that sdks made available

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
by prominent companies are legal to use

270
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
which we confirmed in our follow-up

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
interviews

272
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
some delegated these kinds of decisions

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
to their ceos

274
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
and if you work a third-party auditing

275
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
services such as prival and trusted

276
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
their advice

277
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
our app testing also showed that most

278
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
interview participants had third-party

279
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
sdk compliance settings that were

280
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
misconfigured

281
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
the majority of them indicated that

282
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,399
they did not know that they had to

283
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
configure sdks for compliance for

284
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
example one of them said that they

285
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
expected that it's done automatically by

286
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
sdks

287
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,959
others decided not to use them because

288
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,080
the store did not force them to use them

289
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
we also had some participants who used

290
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
some but not all sdk compliance

291
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
configurations correctly

292
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
some said that they lack the resources

293
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,279
that helped them do so while others

294
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
explained that many of their apps that

295
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
are still available on the store are not

296
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
kept up to date with all compliance

297
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
requirements

298
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
therefore the main takeaways from our

299
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
research are that many developers lack

300
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
complete understanding of the behaviors

301
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
of their own apps and their compliance

302
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,079
obligations

303
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,600
most developers lack awareness that

304
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,040
parental consent needs to be verifiable

305
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
many were not aware of the behaviors of

306
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
third-party sdks integrated in their own

307
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
apps

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
and that app stores play a significant

309
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,360
role in how developers learn about their

310
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
compliance obligations how they assess

311
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
whether their apps are in compliance and

312
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
therefore in improving compliance rates

313
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
more importantly many developers are

314
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
feeling the burden of compliance and

315
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
therefore they need guidance on how to

316
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,640
identify and fix compliance issues

317
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,079
in order to reduce the burden of

318
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,079
compliance we recommend that the stores

319
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,519
provide developers with usable

320
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
compliance checking tools app compliance

321
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
status during app submission to the

322
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
stores and up-to-date pointers to the

323
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
various sdk compliance settings that

324
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
need to be configured

325
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
and since the prior work has showed that

326
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,399
developers are more likely to keep using

327
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
the default settings of third-party sdks

328
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
we expect modifying the defaults to be

329
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,399
privacy preserving to help in improving

330
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
compliance rates

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
however for guidance to be effective it

332
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
has to not introduce more burden on

333
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,839
developers by making sure that it's

334
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,000
accurate timely up to date and easy to

335
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
understand

336
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
at the same time we also believe that

337
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,720
the stores are well positioned to

338
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
provide better enforcement of the

339
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,000
requirements of applicable privacy laws

340
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,399
in conclusion our mixed methods research

341
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
showed that app developers place a large

342
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
degree of trust in the policy

343
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839

349

provided with actionable guidance usable

350
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
compliance checking tools and better
