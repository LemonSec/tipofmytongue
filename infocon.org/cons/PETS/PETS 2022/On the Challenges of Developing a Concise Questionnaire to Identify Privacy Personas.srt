welcome to our presentation on the

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,319
challenges of developing a concise

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,319
questionnaire to identify privacy

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,520
personas

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,840
this is a joint work by me tom biselli

christian reuter we're from the pc group

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,840
at the technical university darmstadt

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,680
where we conduct research at the

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
intersection of crisis informatics and

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
information warfare technical peace

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
research and research on usable safety

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,400
security and privacy

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
the starting point for this study was

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
the observation that individuals differ

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
and need tailored support according to

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,840
their privacy knowledge attitudes and

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,760
behaviors this observation is backed by

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,320
plenty of research which suggests that

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320
users differ substantially in their

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,199
privacy preferences and needs

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
for example demographic differences have

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
been reported regarding privacy

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,559
attitudes and behavior in a sense that

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,680
based on age gender and education

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
individuals differ in these privacy

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
dimensions

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,320
and consequently

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,240
individualization has been proposed as a

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
promising approach for improving users

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
privacy

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
therefore several approaches try to

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,759
segment the user space to conceptualize

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
such differing user needs

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
a classic initial typology was provided

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
by westin who identified three privacy

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
personas fundamentalists pragmatists and

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,960
unconcerned

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,880
several other approaches included

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
qualitative interviews quantitative

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
questionnaires combinations of the two

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
from a methodological standpoint

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
they also combine different privacy

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,799
dimensions

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
and in the end identify three four

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,960
sometimes even five privacy personas and

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
the key question always is which

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
instruments are used to segment the

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
users

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
and how reliable are those instruments

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,439
so the research gap we identified

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
included first of all the need for a

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,640
concise questionnaire

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,160
well there were several very

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
comprehensive clustering approaches none

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,560
of the previous approaches have tried to

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,959
cluster users in a time-saving manner

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
which however would be quite beneficial

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,520
in a practical context

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
furthermore we targeted knowledge and

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,560
behavior as the two privacy dimensions

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
with a high practical relevance and

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
missing from the literature

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
in this context

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
often a thorough methodological

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
evaluation of the questionnaire used is

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
missing from the literature

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
but since this is the basis for defining

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
really accurate privacy personas we

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
placed a special focus on this issue

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,599
and in the end we wanted to determine

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,680
privacy personas based on these

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
dimensions of the self-developed

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,519
questionnaire

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,159
so taken together we wanted to answer

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,640
the research question whether

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
a concise methodologically sound

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
questionnaire can be developed for

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
defining a user space with distinct

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
privacy personas using a knowledge

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
behavior ratio

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
to answer this research question we

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
developed items separately for assessing

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
privacy knowledge and privacy behavior

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
based on the literature and then

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
conducted a representative survey with

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
german citizens

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
the methodological backbone of our study

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920
were multiple confirmatory factor

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,360
analysis that we conducted

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
so how did we reduce our initially quite

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,080
big item set of 81 items to 11 items in

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
the end

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
initially we conducted an item analysis

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
to make sure all items have

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,879
a sufficiently wide range as well as

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,439
reasonable item difficulties and a

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,159
reasonable discriminatory power

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
then we conducted

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
multiple factor analysis and in this

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
context we excluded items with multiple

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
clearly outlying local fit values

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,959
because these

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
values indicate that the respective item

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
is rather unspecific and the model does

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
not accurately predict its values

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
and the goal here was to be rather

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
strict and further reduce items to

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,880
arrive at a very concise questionnaire

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,759
with this we arrived at 11 items for the

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,240
final questionnaire on the basis we also

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
conducted a cross validation for which

114
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
we split our sample prior to the data

115
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,680
analysis

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
so just very briefly this is what the

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,759
final model looks like on the left hand

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,280
side

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,000
with eight behavior and three knowledge

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
items and the corresponding item

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,240
formulations on the right hand side we

122
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
can't go

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
into detail here but

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
important is that the factor loadings

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,919
marked in red reveal first weaknesses of

126
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,120
the model

127
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
with only a few being above 0.70 which

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
would be

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
would be good and

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,960
few items also being above the bare

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
minimum of 0.40

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
so the loadings are quite low and i'll

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
get to

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,600
these methodological issues in a second

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,840
on the basis of this questionnaire we

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
conducted a data-driven clustering which

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
suggested three clusters and us three

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
personas to best describe the available

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,400
data

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
we termed them fundamentalists reporting

141
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
high privacy knowledge and strong

142
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,120
privacy behavior

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,919
pragmatists reporting medium knowledge

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
and medium behavior

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,880
and unconcerned reporting low privacy

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
knowledge and

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,880
weak privacy behavior

148
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
however the clustering here can only be

149
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
considered a very rough approximation

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
because of severe weaknesses of the

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
questionnaire with regard to model fit

152
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,360
reliability and validity

153
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
while the global model fit in itself

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
were satisfactory a bit less so in a

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,919
cross-validation sample but still

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,120
reasonable

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
especially regarding local fit

158
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
weaknesses emerged

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
and the specific values here are not

160
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,479
relevant

161
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
what's relevant is that

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,960
statistically significant residuals

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
remained in the model

164
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
indicating misloadings of certain items

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
and this in turn indicated that those

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
items were rather unspecific and might

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
also have loaded on the other factor

168
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
meaning a

169
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,919
knowledge item might have also loaded on

170
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,280
a behavior item and vice versa and since

171
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
this pattern was visible in both samples

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
this casts doubt on the stability of the

173
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,800
presumed two-factor structure

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
besides these model issues further

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
weaknesses regarding reliability and

176
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
validity were apparent too

177
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,599
alpha and omega as measures for

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
reliability showed satisfactory values

179
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
above 0.70 only for the behavior scale

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
but not for the knowledge scale

181
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,759
also average variance extracted as a

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
measure for convergent validity

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,120
should be above 0.50

184
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
but was actually

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
just above 0.30 for both scales

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
and this means that in the end more

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
variance remains in the error of the

188
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
respective items than in the variance

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
explained by the latent construct

190
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
knowledge or behavior

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,639
so this is a bad thing and we cannot

192
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
argue that we established this

193
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
convergent validity so even though htmt

194
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
as a measure of discriminant validity

195
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
was satisfactory these issues of local

196
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,720
model fit reliability and validity

197
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
severely undermine the quality of the

198
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
questionnaire

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,120
so taken together the three identified

200
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
personas are not new per se

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,919
even though we identified them on novel

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,879
dimensions however as previously stated

203
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,960
they can only be considered a very rough

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,639
approximation due to the low

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
signal-to-noise ratio of the

206
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
questionnaire

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,440
the thorough evaluation of the

208
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
questionnaire suggested that it cannot

209
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
be considered a reliable and valid

210
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,039
instrument

211
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
and actually this evaluation process

212
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
sheds light on

213
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
the differing quality of potential

214
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
instruments and that such differing

215
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,120
quality

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,080
of instruments used to determine privacy

217
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
personas might actually be one of the

218
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
reasons for the heterogeneity in the

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
number of

220
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
privacy personas reported in the

221
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
literature and therefore the quality of

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
instruments should always be considered

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
when drawing conclusions regarding for

224
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
example privacy personas

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
these results have some implications for

226
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
research on privacy personas but also on

227
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
any other privacy related phenomena

228
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,360
which are examined using questionnaires

229
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
this includes the consideration of

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
ordinality of liquid items

231
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,720
because often liquid items are treated

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
as interval scaled during the

233
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
statistical analysis which is

234
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,480
technically incorrect

235
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,120
and i did not dive in this into this

236
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
topic during this talk but we chose a

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
robust robust estimator in our factor

238
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,680
analysis to account for this ordinality

239
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
which in turn makes model selection more

240
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
difficult because standard comparison

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
methods are not available when choosing

242
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,680
between a reduced versus non-reduced

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,360
model for example so this is an

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,920
important issue to keep in mind

245
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
furthermore cross-validation is

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,080
absolutely indispensable especially when

247
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
items are dropped and models are

248
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
re-specified because we always run the

249
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
risk of artificially inflating model fit

250
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
in this process

251
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
furthermore

252
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
construct validity should be verified

253
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,839
of

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,880
when

255
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,040
questionnaires are used especially when

256
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
questionnaires are used which are not as

257
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,079
established and this also includes

258
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,640
evaluating the local fit and not only

259
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,839
relying on the global

260
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,600
fit furthermore the broadness of

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
conclusions drawn of a study must be

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,160
directly related to reliability and

263
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
validity coefficients of those

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
instruments because

265
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
they represent among other things

266
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
quantifications of the signal-to-noise

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,279
ratio of a questionnaire

268
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,839
and finally transparent reporting is

269
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
absolutely important and enables other

270
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
researchers to assess the quality of

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,320
instruments and facilitates further

272
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
validation efforts

273
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
i want to close with a rather trivial

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,279
but nonetheless important reminder which

275
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,160
is

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,720
that the description of privacy personas

277
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
and other constructs can only be as

278
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
accurate as the instruments used to

279
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
determine them are methodologically

280
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
sound

281
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
with this i thank you for your attention

282
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,120
i'm happy to answer any questions thank

283
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,120
you
