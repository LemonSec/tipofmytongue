hello everybody my name is erin zhang i

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,279
am a phd student in the school of

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,799
computer science at carnegie valley

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,679
university today i will present our work

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,120
how usable ios app privacy labels

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,960
this work is in collaboration with the

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
union phong yashin yao lori crainer and

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,439
norman sade

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,880
notice and consent have been

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
foundational principles in privacy and

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,199
data protection for over decades

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
notice is typically addressed through

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,519
the publication of our privacy policy

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,640
in practice

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,280
users rarely read these privacy policies

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,360
which are not just long and difficult

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
but also tend to be ambiguous or silent

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,559
about important issues

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,559
the concept of privacy nutrition labels

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,320
were first introduced by kelly and

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,440
colleagues

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,520
behind the idea is that privacy policies

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,559
are faulty

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,559
these privacy nutrition labels offer a

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
standardized and sustained way of

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,239
informing people about data collection

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,840
and use practices

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
focusing on a small set of issues that

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,879
particularly matter to most users

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,359
in december 2020 apple introduced the

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
app privacy labels on the app store

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
recently google's play store also rolled

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
out the data safety sections

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,240
these are reminiscent of the privacy

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
nutrition labels introduced and

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
evaluated in research over a decade

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
earlier

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
the ios privacy labels have been

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,640
available for over 600 000 apps for a

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
period of time

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
opening the door for researchers to

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,960
study their effectiveness in the wild

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,040
we are interested in finding out do

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,200
these privacy labels actually work and

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
are they usable to answer these

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
questions we conduct the first interview

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
study with lay iphone users to

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,360
investigate their experiences

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
understanding and perceptions of apple's

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
privacy labels

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
we recruited 24 participants across the

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,759
united states and conducted interviews

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,079
over zoom

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,439
let me briefly explain the study

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,479
protocol

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,920
we start with questions about

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,159
participants experiences using an iphone

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,600
and downloading apps

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
we asked them whether they had wondered

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
about or investigated what information

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
apps collect

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
and whether privacy was a factor when

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
downloading apps

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,479
then we asked participants to share

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,879
their iphone screen through zoom and ask

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
them to visit the app store on their

67
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,040
phone and read the compact and detailed

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
privacy labels of two apps

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
doordash and chipotle in a randomized

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
order for each app we ask some specific

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
questions related to the privacy labels

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
such as their understanding of terms in

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
the labels and their interpretations of

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
data practices disclosed

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
and to compare several similar terms and

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
explain the differences if there are any

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,800
after participants completed all the

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
questions for both apps we asked about

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
their general perceptions of the privacy

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
labels

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
including whether they found these

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
labels to be useful or not what they

83
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
liked or disliked about these labels and

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,480
whether they would use them in the

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,519
future

86
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,760
in addition we also asked whom they

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,120
consider to be the source of the

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
information presented in the labels

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
let's move on to the results of the

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
study

91
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
most participants have questions about

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
app privacy but generally lack the

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
usable sources for answers

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
many participants did report having

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
privacy concerns regarding apps

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
some described removing newly downloaded

97
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,000
apps because

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
specific personal information was

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
requested during sign up

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
some indicated that they had deleted

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
apps

102
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
after data breach or learning about

103
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,159
privacy concerns regarding these apps

104
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
most of the participants are unaware of

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
privacy labels

106
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
only a few had actually read them

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
some knew that they existed but scroll

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
past them in the app store

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
here we report participants perceptions

110
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
of privacy labels

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
most participants reported finding these

112
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
labels to be useful for example one

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
participant specifically said the labels

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,159
compared favorably to lengthy privacy

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
policies

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
most participants reported that they

117
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
would refer to the labels in the future

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,680
and the labels would impact their

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
decision to download apps

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
some participants reported that they

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
would look at the privacy labels for

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
apps that they were not familiar with or

123
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
to use them to compare apps

124
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,720
310 of the participants mistakenly

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
assume that apple is responsible for the

126
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
labels specifically a few participantly

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,440
thought apple and the app developers

128
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
together produce the labels well some

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,600
thought the labels were provided by

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
apple

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
also the majority wrongly believed that

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,639
apple had reviewed or verified the

133
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,000
information in the labels

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,759
we reported misunderstanding that our

135
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,919
participant expressed as they look at

136
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,160
the two privacy labels

137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,720
at a high level about half our

138
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
participants mistakenly assumed the

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
label included all app data collection

140
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
and usage

141
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
however apple does not require

142
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,199
disclosure of all app data collection

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
disclosure is optional for data that are

144
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
not used for tracking or advertising

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,160
purposes collected infrequently and

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
collected in the app's user interface

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
and about half were confused about label

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,639
structure itself

149
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,360
especially how to find the purposes

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
and also they did not understand why

151
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
specific data types were shown multiple

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,240
times

153
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
for instance when we asked about what

154
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
app functionality means participants try

155
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
to explain it by looking at things

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
underneath such as purchases and

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
financial information

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
and they weren't really sure how these

159
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
data types shown are related to ad

160
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
functionality

161
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
there is oh there is also a lot of

162
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
misunderstanding and confusion around

163
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
terminology used in the labels

164
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
all participants express confusion about

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,080
one or more terms used in the labels or

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
give interpretations of terms that did

167
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,320
not match apple's definition for

168
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,639
instance apple's definition of tracking

169
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
actually only refers to third-party

170
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,520
tracking

171
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,199
however this is not clear to

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,400
participants

173
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,479
some participants can consider tracking

174
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,639
to mean first-party tracking and they

175
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,520
were surprised to find that tracking

176
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
involves sharing information with other

177
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
parties rather than just collecting data

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,360
such as user's location or app usage

179
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
participants were also confused by data

180
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
linked to you and data not linked to you

181
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,919
especially they were confused by data

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,080
such as contact information and their

183
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,560
data not linked to you

184
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,199
one participant commented it states it's

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
not linked to you but obviously it is

186
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
linked to you because it's your personal

187
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
information like your address your email

188
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,160
address your phone number and your name

189
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
these are all very personal things that

190
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
are specifically you as opposed to them

191
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
stating this is like completely

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
anonymous

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
actually we as privacy researchers

194
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
are not also confused by this part of

195
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,720
the label and we are not even sure why

196
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
this is the case as well

197
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
there are also entangled and overlapping

198
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,400
definitions using the labels for example

199
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
most participants were particularly

200
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,919
confused about the terms product

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
personalization and functionality and

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,720
analytics they either admitted that they

203
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
did not know the definitions of these

204
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
terms or give their own definitions in

205
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,720
which they mix up the terms you can find

206
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
more examples like this in the paper

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
there are also frequently used terms

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
describing data types that confuse

209
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
participants

210
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,080
for example usage data identifiers and

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
diagnostics

212
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,080
the data category user content was

213
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
called out as confusing by about half of

214
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
our participants

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,400
another source of confusion is the vague

216
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
language when participants sought terms

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
on the label related to other data types

218
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
and other purposes

219
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
almost all expressed and they did not

220
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,199
know what these other categories could

221
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,319
entail

222
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
and about half our participants said

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
these terms made them anxious or

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,800
decreased utility of the label

225
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
for other examples of league language

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
please refer to the taper

227
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
our participants had a number of ideas

228
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,800
for improvements

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,479
the majority of our participants

230
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
suggested making the definitions of the

231
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
label terms more accessible

232
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
currently the definition of the terms

233
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,400
are available through a link to a web

234
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,720
page with all the definitions in one

235
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,599
place

236
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,840
however many participants wanted to see

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
each term linked to its definitions

238
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
perhaps appearing through a hover

239
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
many also suggested providing concrete

240
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
and contextualized examples of the data

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,318
being collected

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
many participants voiced their

243
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
frustration with the labels due to their

244
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
lack of controls and they suggested

245
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,640
adding controls to turn off some of the

246
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,360
data collection

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
recall that participants found the

248
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
structure of the label to be confusing

249
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
and many had the misconception that some

250
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,519
sections were redundant

251
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
underlying this confusion is that the

252
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
label designers mapped a

253
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
multi-dimensional space of data types

254
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
and purposes onto a list-based label

255
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,200
representation

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
a matrix or tabular approach might offer

257
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,839
a more compact and intuitive

258
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,480
representation

259
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
participants suggested other topics

260
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
related to privacy that they would like

261
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
to see added to the label

262
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
some participants asked about data

263
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
retention

264
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,959
some

265
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,399
participants were interested in knowing

266
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,480
to whom the apps are sending or sharing

267
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
their information

268
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
a few participants wanted to know

269
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
where they could have their questions

270
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
answered

271
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
a few users wanted to better understand

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,399
the price implications of using the app

273
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
and any measures the app was taking to

274
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,600
protect their privacy

275
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,399
in summary we have found that the ios

276
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
privacy labels in their current

277
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
implementations are not delivering the

278
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,839
promises we provide the following three

279
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,760
recommendations first of all the labels

280
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
should do a better job at helping users

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,839
to comprehend complex app privacy

282
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,040
practices

283
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
currently the labels suffer from a range

284
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
of misunderstandings

285
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
in addition vague language such as other

286
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,920
categories or user content also impede

287
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
participants understanding of the actual

288
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
data practices

289
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
we've also observed the definition of

290
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
the terms are not completely consistent

291
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
on the android and ios platforms such as

292
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,680
the term tracking it would be better if

293
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
the industry were to adopt standard

294
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
terms and definitions for privacy labels

295
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,959
empirically tested with both developers

296
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,920
and late users

297
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
secondly even though the privacy labels

298
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
were introduced in apple's app store

299
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
over a year ago at the time of our study

300
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
most of our our participants are still

301
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,320
unaware of them

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,399
our findings shows that the

303
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
discoverability of these labels on each

304
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
individual apps page in the app store is

305
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,399
low

306
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
currently users have to scroll past a

307
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
number of sections before landing on the

308
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,160
app privacy section

309
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
there is a need for more prominent

310
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,480
placement of privacy labels

311
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,800
and also additional mechanisms to bring

312
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,279
users attention to privacy labels for

313
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
apps that users already have on their

314
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
phones

315
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
thirdly some participants reported being

316
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
disappointed because after learning the

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
information presented by the labels they

318
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,519
were not provided with any actionable

319
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,440
steps they could take

320
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
it would be helpful if the permission

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
manager or the permission settings

322
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
would include the relevant app privacy

323
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,959
labels

324
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
or the privacy nudges on the mobile

325
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,120
platforms would include links to the

326
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
labels

327
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
because those places are where users

328
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
decide which permissions or whether to

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
grant certain permissions to each app

330
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
also the privacy labels are shown within

331
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
the descriptions of individual apps in

332
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,040
the app store there's no functionality

333
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,839
to enable users to compare apps or look

334
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
for equivalent apps with less invasive

335
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
or more desirable data practices

336
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
the app store should enable users to

337
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,639
search for apps that meet certain

338
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
privacy criteria

339
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
this concludes my presentation and thank

340
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,079
you for your attention
