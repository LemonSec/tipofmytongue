00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,919
hello everyone my name is kazuki namoto

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,240
and i am a second year masters student

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,880
at western university in japan

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,000
today i will present on the feasibility

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
of linking attack to google apple

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
exposure notification framework

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,359
this research is a collaboration of

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
western university mtt ministry of

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
internal affairs and communications

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,199
osaka university national institute of

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,640
information and communication

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
technologies and regain center for

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,160
advanced intelligence project

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
first i provide a background of our

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,000
research

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,160
contact tracing is used worldwide to

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,120
prevent the spread of covet 19

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
discrimination and prejudice against

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,920
persons who are competently positive and

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
health care worker is a social problem

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
people's privacy should not be

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,360
threatened by contact racing

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
i present an overview of this study

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,719
we targeted google apple's exposure

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,199
notification which is a representative

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
implementation of digital contract

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
tracing

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
we proposed and evaluated the phase

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
photo linking attack

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
this attack is the link of python phase

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
follow to his or her copy to 19

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,759
infection status

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
we addressed three research questions

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
the first is is a linking attack target

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
the google app exposure notification

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
framework feasible

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
the second is easy attack scalable

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
the last is what is the effect of

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,479
approach to mitigating the attack

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
i will present today along with the

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
order of these research questions

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
first i explain about close contact

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,399
a close contact is someone who was less

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,360
than 1.8 meter away from an infected

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
person who are cumulative total of 15

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
minutes or more over 24 hour period

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
a person in close contact with a

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,560
positive person is likely infected with

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
carpet 19 and should be isolated and the

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
pcr tested

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,360
next i explained contact tracing

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
identification of closed contact has

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
traditionally been done manually

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,000
in covet 19 a mechanism was established

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
to automatically detect close contact

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
using digital technology such as

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
smartphone qr codes and bluetooth

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
this mechanism is called digital contra

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,720
tracing

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
the google oppo exposure notification

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
framework is a representative

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
implementation of digital contract

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,879
racing

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,200
this framework was developed by google

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
and apple it is installed as standard on

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
android and ios

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
this is widely used 38 countries

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,680
exposure notification framework uses

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
bluetooth low energy to send and

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,640
relative identifiers to each other

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
the framework installed on each

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
smartphone sent its own identifier to

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
the smartphone of others as shown in

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
this slide

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
the smartphone stores identifier

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
received from the other smartphone

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
next i will explain how close contact

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
detection works in the exposure

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
notification framework

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
covet 19 positive users upload their

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,519
identifiers to the observer using the

82
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
app functions

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
the app server distribute the uploaded

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
positive identifier to all app users

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,239
the app compares the positive identifier

86
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,879
with identifiers it has received and

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
stored for various people

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
this low energy in the past

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
if the stored identifier and the

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,480
positive identifier match

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,760
then close contact is detected

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,439
based on these backgrounds and

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
mechanisms i will describe the attack

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,480
procedures

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
i show the threat model

96
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
the attacker aims to automatically

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
collect phase photo of commit line

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
deposits

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
initially the attacker links the

100
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
identifier to the sender's phase photo

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
for example the standard transmitted

102
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
died in fire one two three

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
this which transmitted identifier ccc

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
the identifier of positive person are

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,840
distributed by key servers

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
the other get the positive person's

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
identifier

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
the attacker compares the positive

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
person's identifier with the result of

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
one previous step to find the positive

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
person's phase follow

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,840
as a result of these steps the attacker

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
is able to obtain the positive phase

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
follows

115
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
in these attack procedures linking in

116
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,199
step 2 can be easily feasible with an

117
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
implementation that follow the algorithm

118
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
the key point of this study is step one

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
we use signal strength variations to

120
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
link identifiers to the target the

121
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,479
attacker places a bluetooth low energy

122
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
receiving antenna at a location where

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
pedestrians work

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,120
the article continues to receive

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
identifiers transmitted by the

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,400
smartphone

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
the figure on the light is an image

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
graph of the relationship between time

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
and signal strength

130
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,320
it is assumed that the signal strength

131
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
increases as the target approaches in

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,280
front of the receiving antenna and the

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
decrease as it moves away

134
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
the attack links the identifier to the

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
sender by using signal strength

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
variations

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,240
from here we show the feasibility of

138
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
linking attack on research question 1.

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
i show the setup of the experiment

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
in the experiment two cameras and

141
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,199
parabolic antenna connected to a

142
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
bluetooth low energy receiver are set up

143
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
as shown in this figure

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,759
pedestrians work in front of the setup

145
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,000
this graph shows the relationship

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
between time and signal strength

147
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,960
recorded in the experiment

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,600
the blue dotted line plots the time and

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960
signal strength of the received signal

150
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
the late dotted line is the time when

151
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
the pedestrian reaches the front of the

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
antenna

153
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
the blue stomach is a time when the

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
signal strength is as its maximum

155
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
the result demonstrates that the timing

156
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,039
when the signal strength of the target

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,319
is at its maximum and the time when the

158
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,880
target passes in front of the camera are

159
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
very close

160
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,199
i show photos taken by the camera at the

161
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
time of maximum signal strength

162
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
the target is captured in the center of

163
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,280
the photos

164
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
this result means that the timing based

165
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,560
linking attack is feasible

166
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
in addition this study evaluated the

167
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,919
impact of smartphone models distance

168
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
between the receiving antenna and the

169
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,440
pedestrians

170
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
and how the smartphone is held i omit

171
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,039
detailed results of the experiment in

172
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
this presentation but we found that the

173
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
attack was lowest for these conditions

174
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
next we evaluate the scalability of the

175
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
attack

176
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,440
in this study we built a simulation of

177
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
human flow and signal strength

178
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,199
we used the simulation to evaluate the

179
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
attack success rate

180
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
the working speed of individual

181
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
pedestrians is given by the normal

182
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,120
distribution

183
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,440
pedestrians are assumed to alive laundry

184
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,639
according to the poison process

185
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,039
the signal strength received by the

186
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,160
attacker's parabolic antenna is computed

187
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,919
using risk transmission equation

188
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
freeze transmission equation shows the

189
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
relationship between under again

190
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,240
signal strength wavelength and distance

191
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,319
in this presentation

192
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
i evaluate the attack success rate by

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,479
focusing on the number of pedestrians

194
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
per hour

195
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
and the number of attack devices set up

196
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,120
i show the result of the simulation

197
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,599
this table shows the relationship

198
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,400
between the number of pedestrians per

199
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,240
hour the number of attack devices set up

200
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,399
and the attack success rate

201
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,279
when the number of pedestrians per hour

202
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,120
is 800

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,159
and the number of attack devices is one

204
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,320
the attack success rate is 83 percent

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,279
when the number of pedestrians per hour

206
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,959
is 5000 and the number of attack devices

207
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,399
is one

208
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,600
their attack success rate dollops to 38

209
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
percent

210
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
this means that the result of reduced

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
distance between people it has become

212
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
more difficult to link identifiers to

213
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,959
their senders

214
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,600
the attack success rate increased 75

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
percent by increasing the number of

216
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
attack devices placed to three

217
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
and increasing the number of attack

218
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,720
attempts these results show that this

219
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,600
attack has a high success rate of 83

220
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
percent in uncrowded spaces and a high

221
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,680
success rate of 75 percent in clouded

222
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
spaces by increasing the number of

223
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,600
attack devices

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,480
finally we present counter measures

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
against this attack

226
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
we propose and evaluate the two

227
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
effective countermeasures against the

228
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,000
linking attack

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
please leave her to the people for

230
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
detail on the variation of the

231
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,080
countermeasures since we omit them in

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
the presentation due to time limitations

233
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,560
i show ethical considerations we

234
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,279
reported our findings and actionable

235
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
countermeasures to google and apple the

236
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,959
developer of the framework the attack is

237
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,519
not caused by a specific applications of

238
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
baron verity

239
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
but by the design of the digital contact

240
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
tracing framework based on bluetooth

241
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,399
slow energy

242
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
we believe that publishing these people

243
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,959
will provide insight and benefit broad

244
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,600
stakeholders

245
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,519
i show a summary

246
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,399
we conducted the field experiment using

247
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
a liada equipment and the lyricistic

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,360
simulation experiment that incorporate

249
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
lady characteristics and the 3d model of

250
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,160
a human being the result demonstrated

251
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
the linking attack is highly feasible

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
and that an attacker can succeed as a

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
probability of 75 percent against the

254
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,720
high pedestrian traffic flow of 5000

255
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,200
people per hour by installing a few

256
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
attack devices in addition we proposed

257
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
effective countermeasures we hope that

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
the findings of this study will

259
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
contribute to the design of a digital

260
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
contract tracing framework with improved

261
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
privacy projections

262
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
finally we discuss future deductions of

263
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,920
research based on the findings of this

264
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,640
study these studies show the linking the

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,720
transmitter to the content of the

266
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
transmission can be easily feasible

267
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
this finding laziest fundamental

268
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,320
flybashing concerns about the mechanisms

269
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
that emit lady waves

270
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
for example linking attack target

271
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
bluetooth and wi-fi communication can

272
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
reveal the sender of the communication

273
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
while this is one example of the

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
anonymization using a linking attack the

275
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
linking attack raises concerns for

276
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,079
numerous mechanisms that emit lady waves

277
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,560
not just digital contra tracing we

278
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
suggest appropriate evaluation and the

279
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,040
implementation of quantum measures for

280
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
each these mechanisms as a future

281
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
direction thank you for listening
