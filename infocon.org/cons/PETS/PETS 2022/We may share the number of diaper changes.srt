hello my name is moritz gruber and i'm

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,520
here to present to you our latest

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
research we may share the number of

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
diaper changes a privacy and security

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
evaluation of mobile child care

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,759
applications

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,080
this work was a cooperation of the

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,720
institute of internet security in

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,240
gaelsen creation

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,320
the aware 7

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,000
secunet

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,320
and the max planck institute in bochum

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,280
our research team

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,000
includes a few young fathers

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
and therefore calls our whatsapp

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
messengers with information from child

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,600
care our our normal everyday life

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
but besides messages via whatsapp there

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,360
are also apps for communication with

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,079
child care

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
therefore we decided to evaluate

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
childcare apps in more detail

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,440
first of all we were surprised by the

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,520
wide range of functions these apps offer

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
if you take a closer look

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,920
at our example screenshots you get an

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,000
impression of those

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
they allow the employees of a daycare

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
center to manage the data of children or

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,200
to communicate with the parents

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,520
furthermore many of those apps allow

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
parents to share data about their

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
children or to get in touch with other

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
parents

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,119
the functionality of some of those apps

36
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,759
is quite familiar to that of a social

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,320
network like for example facebook

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
our goal in this work was to evaluate

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,479
how the security of our children's data

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,680
is handled in such apps

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
we wanted to look at the whole project

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,119
from a privacy point of view and from a

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640
security point of view

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
in total we looked at 42 apps for

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
android

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
those apps are identified by searching

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
the google play store for terms like

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,959
child care app or preschool management

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
apps as well as many others

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,280
we then manually evaluated all these

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
apps we found according to the following

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
criteria to determine if they fit in our

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,800
scope

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,879
the first criteria was

55
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,959
the app is intended for the child care

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,040
sector

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
the second was

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
the app should be used for the

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
communications between parents and child

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,640
care workers

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,760
and lastly the app provides a management

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
interface for storing data of children

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,000
and processing and managing it

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
in the end 42 apps remained

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,840
these apps together have over 3 million

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
users according to the google play store

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
the largest market share

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
are held by blooms and brightwheel with

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
over a million users each

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
all these apps process highly sensitive

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
data such as

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
names addresses behavior of children

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
photos videos their current location and

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
even health data

75
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,440
all this data is considered to be highly

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
highly sensitive

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,560
to ensure the privacy of minorities the

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
regulations of gdpr and copper surf

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
we use those regulations to evaluate the

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,798
privacy policies of the 42 apps

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,440
since we wanted to analyze the apps from

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
a security and privacy

83
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
point of view

84
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,000
this was our analysis pipeline as shown

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
in this image

86
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
each of the examined apps was decompiled

87
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
and statically analyzed

88
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,200
after awards we performed the dynamic

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
analysis of the apps to capture their

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,480
behavior and communication life

91
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
we finally took a closer look at the

92
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,519
privacy policies of each of those apps

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
in a static analysis we used a wide

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,360
variety of tools to identify for example

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,320
misconfigured firebase database used by

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
those apps

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
furthermore we took a closer look at the

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
permissions set by those apps and

99
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
evaluated which dangerous permissions

100
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
are used

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
we took the definition of dangerous

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
permissions from google's android

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
documentation

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
lastly

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
we looked at the libraries which are

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
used by the app and whether they are

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,960
outdated or are built insecurely

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
the dynamic analysis we examined the

109
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
apps with an interception proxy in order

110
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
to be able to read and evaluate the

111
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
external communication of those apps

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,320
so we could evaluate the communication

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
to the backend and how

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
tls is handled by those apps and

115
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
backends

116
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
another important point was to evaluate

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
how the data of the app is stored

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,360
and therefore we looked at the data of

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
the apps locally on the android

120
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
smartphone and we also tried to find

121
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
insecure cloud storages used by those

122
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
apps externally

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
furthermore we looked at the backends

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,759
for common vulnerabilities in such apps

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
such as insecure direct object

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,199
referencing short idol or

127
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
outdated software components or other

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
vulnerabilities

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
we also looked at the privacy policies

130
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
of those apps

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
manually since almost a third were not

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
written in english language

133
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
we took the privacy policy from the link

134
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
in the google play store

135
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
among other things we evaluated whether

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,639
the privacy policy

137
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,960
mentions the processing of data of

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
miners it was

139
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
also interesting to us whether the

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
privacy policy lists which data is

141
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
stored

142
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
and which data is processed

143
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
we also wanted to evaluate whether it is

144
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,400
possible to read out one's own data

145
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,280
11 of the privacy policies examined did

146
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
not describe the app in the first place

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
but a website of the provider or the

148
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,080
whole privacy policy of the provider but

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,759
they didn't mention the app at all

150
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,800
one third of the apps did not list

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
any data they store or process at all

152
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,639
we found it particularly surprising

153
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
that only 96

154
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,759
of the privacy policies mention that

155
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
they process or stay our data from

156
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,160
children at all

157
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
but this is their only purpose these are

158
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,680
apps for processing and storing data of

159
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,759
children and communication with those

160
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
parents

161
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,400
in the table shown here we see a section

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
from a table from our paper

163
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
this clearly shows how diversified the

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,680
results of our privacy analysis were

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,639
a good example for a poorly maintained

166
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
privacy policy would be the app hokita

167
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,240
which does not mention processing of

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,520
data from children in its privacy policy

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,479
also this is obviously its purpose

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
furthermore no no information about the

171
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,759
track has used or the data stored or

172
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,680
processed is described in this policy

173
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,919
the situation is similar to the app's

174
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,159
parent zone or strampla bundle

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,840
on the other side a positive example is

176
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
the app daily connect or live kit

177
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
which met all our requirements and list

178
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
their privacy policy he that they

179
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
process data from miners

180
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
furthermore they list which data this is

181
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
they process and store and which

182
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,440
trackers they use

183
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,160
besides these there are also many apps

184
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
like hi mama or kaimbu that only lists

185
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
part of the required data

186
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
which only shows how to how to device

187
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
the results of in the sectora

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
and this only shows how many work there

189
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
is to do for those

190
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,040
those companies to fix their privacy

191
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
policies

192
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,680
the majority of apps examine support

193
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
security doesn't support security

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
features such as certificate pinning

195
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
this is a feature which would it may

196
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,800
make much more difficult for a man in

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
the middle attacker to read and listen

198
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
to the communication or to manu

199
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
manipulate it

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
89 of all apps we examine still support

201
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,360
outdated android versions like android

202
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
2.1

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,279
these are versions that are no longer

204
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
supported by google

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
and doesn't get any updates from google

206
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
at all

207
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,320
we also found that 30 percent of the

208
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
libraries we stacked statically analyzed

209
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,320
were either outdated or compiled with

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
the necessary security flags

211
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,519
functions such as address relocation or

212
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,640
stack canary or

213
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,399
non-executable stacks were missing on

214
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
those libraries

215
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,079
we also found that 70 percent of the

216
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
dynamically analyzed back ends we

217
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
examined used outdated components with

218
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
noun vulnerabilities

219
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
this means that vulnerabilities with

220
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
cves are known for a large part of the

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
back ends analyzed

222
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,360
in the dynamic analysis we also looked

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
whether the backends are suspectable to

224
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
common vulnerabilities

225
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,519
this was the case for 10 of the back-end

226
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
servers we found sql injections graphql

227
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,360
injections and also insecure direct

228
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
object referencing vulnerabilities and

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,920
many others

230
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
all these apps

231
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
allow an attacker to access data of

232
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,320
other users through such vulnerabilities

233
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,760
we also identify cloud storage in 12 of

234
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,880
the apps

235
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,519
this was particularly alarming as the

236
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,240
most sensitive data could be accessed

237
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,839
unencrypted and unsecured on the

238
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,040
internet there were amazon aws buckets

239
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,920
and firebase databases which contained

240
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,120
chat messengers pictures of children

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
videos

242
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,839
and user data such as email

243
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,959
addresses and clear names

244
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,079
overall it should be noted the large

245
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,720
proportion of the apps studied use

246
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,800
insecure and incomplete privacy policies

247
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,519
this is especially a problem as more and

248
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
more child care institutions will rely

249
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
on digital communication challenge

250
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
channels and applications and use

251
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,839
services like whatsapp if there are no

252
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
simple but secure solutions

253
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
to improve the situations guidelines and

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
checks for the evaluation of child care

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
software and its development should be

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
written in the near future

257
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,880
these guidelines can then be used by

258
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,240
political actors to make manufacturer us

259
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,839
change their way of building

260
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,360
applications

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,959
finally a dialogue with the

262
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,279
manufacturers and developers of such

263
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,240
apps should be initiated this should

264
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
then this should enable them to

265
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
understand the responsibility of the

266
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
data they process and how it can be

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
protected

268
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
in our opinion these are the most

269
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
important takeaways from our analysis of

270
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,800
child care apps thank you very much for

271
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
your attention and we look forward to

272
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,079
answering your questions
