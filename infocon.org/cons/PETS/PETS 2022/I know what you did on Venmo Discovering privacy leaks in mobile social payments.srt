00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,280
hi everyone i'm rajit a computer science

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
phd student at university of southern

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,080
california today i'll be presenting our

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,639
work on i know what you did on venmo

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,480
discovering privacy leaks in mobile

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,960
social payments this is a joint work

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,320
with patio t-shank dr dhiraj murthy and

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
my advisor dr yelena markovic

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
i'll be covering the following content

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
background and motivation followed by

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,519
the objective data that methodology and

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,720
results

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
other concerns and recommendations and

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
finally the conclusions

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
background venmo is a us-based mobile

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
social payments platform

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
each one more transaction requires a

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,680
payment note which is a brief memo

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,920
by default these memos are visible to

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
all other venmo users

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
and public by default policies can

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
actually create privacy risks to users

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
look at the notes on the right side here

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
so the user has a child called james

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,799
they went to disneyland james goes to

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
harvard elementary school the user has a

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
sister susan with whom they split the

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
cost of their parents gifts and also

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
went to flower gardens for

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
scuba diving

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
so the intuition here is that the users

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,479
may not make a conscious choice to share

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
such information publicly

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,720
but are instant doing this

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
by inertia because the platform makes

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
everything public by default

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
motivation

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
so there are several anecdotal incidents

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
wherein oversharing one's personal

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
information online has proved to be very

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,600
dangerous

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
for example last year the u.s president

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,399
joe biden's reno account was discovered

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,159
using the app search tool revealing a

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,840
network of his private social

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
connections and white house officials

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
posing national security risks for the

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
country

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,479
similarly last year the u.s

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
representative matt gates when more

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
transactions were used as an evidence in

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
an investigation of his adult

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,280
relationship with three minors

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
in addition to these two incidents there

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
are many other news reports wherein over

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
sharing information on venmo or other

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,720
social media networking platforms have

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
led to

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,319
theft health benefit laws etc

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
hence in this work the objective is to

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
quantify when more notes privacy risks

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
with respect to sensitive notes such as

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
drug alcohol use or purchases political

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
orientation adult activities etc

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
we also investigate users privacy

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,480
behaviors over time we show the privacy

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400
dangers of group payments on venmo and

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
discuss other ways of over sharing

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
private data on when we'll be on notes

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
finally we provide recommendations for

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,640
improvement

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,120
so what is tentative information

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
information that if leaked can cause

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
inconvenience embarrassment or

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
unfairness to an individual

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
in this work we considered privacy laws

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,200
around the world in how tech giants view

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
sensitive content in order to come up

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,879
with the list of sensitive categories

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
that we look

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
so on the right we show

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
the different sensitive categories that

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
we consider in this work along with an

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,959
example one more note so these include

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
adult content lgbtq

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,799
health drugs alcohol gambling political

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
opinions race ethnicity violence crime

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,959
relations location

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,760
account details email addresses phone

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,120

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,519
physical addresses product activity

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
details such as the tracking numbers of

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,120
of like

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,599
four year service

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
data sets

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
please note that all the data sets that

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,680
we describe here include only the

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
publicly visible and more data

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
we have four data sets here d1 which

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
covers six years of all public data on

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,640
venmo

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
the the rem

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
the remaining have sample data because

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,640
of changes in venmo api which we

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,400
collected later

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
d2 was actually publicly released by

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,599
others

108
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
further we also utilize uh d2 data set

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
to build the ground through data set for

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
our methodology which i'll be explaining

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
in the next slide

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,960
so in our ground through data set three

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
co-authors annotated this data set

114
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,800
one annotator manually selected notes at

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
random from d2 and labeled them until we

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
had thousand per category for training

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
and hundred notes per category for

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
testing the other annotators validated

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
these labels

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
methodology for identifying sensitive

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
nodes so we develop a classification

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
framework send more which classifies the

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
transaction note as one or more of the

124
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
sensitive categories and notes can also

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
be classified as non-sensitive if it

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
does not contain any sensitive

127
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
information

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,199
it has a simple pre-processing module

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
and a semantic engine module for

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
learning or classifying nodes as one or

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,680
more of the sensitive categories using

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,080
the machine learning based nlp technique

133
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,199
board

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
moreover we also use regular expressions

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
for directly discerning categories such

136
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
as email phone numbers addresses etc

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
we find that cenomo achieves per node

138
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,120
classification accuracy of about 90 on

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,039
the ground truth data set and it does

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,120
well on the individual categories too

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
because we have high true positive it

142
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
means that we catch a lot of sensitive

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
nodes small false positives indicate

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
that we do not misclassify something

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
innocuous sensitive

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
actually we may miss some sensitive

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,639
nodes and our analysis is really an

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,639
underestimate

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
so using zenmo our findings are that 41

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,919
million notes out of 389 million nodes

151
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,880
which roughly 10.5 percent the extensive

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
information

153
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,199
8.5 million users out of

154
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,960
22.5 million users which is roughly

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
about 38

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,319
are affected

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
so we can say that about two in five

158
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,240
users

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,800
posted at least one sensitive note

160
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
and among the sensitive notes that the

161
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
users posted relation and drugs alcohol

162
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,840
gambling are two of the most frequent

163
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,600
categories one can infer details about a

164
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,759
venmo user regarding for example who

165
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
their family members are do they have

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
kids are they married are they divorced

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
do they engage in activities like drugs

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,280
alcohol gambling and how often do they

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
do that

170
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
so what may happen is that some users

171
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,120
who are actually privacy conscious and

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
and technically savvy can decide to make

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
their transactions private or visible

174
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,160
only to friends venmo has an option in

175
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,639
their api for making such a setting

176
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
we cannot see these transactions but we

177
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
can infer them as as all the venmo

178
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
transactions and user profiles are

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,759
numbered sequentially so from the gaps

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
in our data sets we can infer what is

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
non-public and quantify it

182
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
we find that although the percentage of

183
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
users with public profile declines the

184
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
sheer number of users with privacy risks

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
actually rises over time

186
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,800
so with the help of these two figures we

187
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
present the public and non-public user

188
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,440
profiles and total notes from april 2013

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
to 2018.

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
we observe that privacy risk increases

191
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
over time despite users measured to

192
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,319
contain it because of the exponential

193
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,039
growth of the number of venmo users over

194
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
time

195
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,560
further a user that does not know how to

196
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
make their transactions not public may

197
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,360
actually post cryptic notes in this work

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
we define cryptic notes as notes with

199
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
one or more of the following patterns

200
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
these may contain only emojis only

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,919
random numbers that don't match our

202
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,720
regular expressions are only english

203
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
interjections and greeting patterns or

204
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
only english stop words use english

205
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
letters that don't contain a vowel

206
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
or

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
it could be notes that are longer than

208
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,919
30 words which are usually copy pasted

209
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,318
notes

210
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
so for cryptic content the trends

211
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
indicate that users are increasingly

212
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,360
trying to protect their privacy

213
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,880
measuring risks from group transactions

214
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
so membership in certain groups can

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
actually be considered sensitive as it

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
can pose privacy risk to users if it's

217
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,760
publicly known

218
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
so in this work we focus on three types

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
of groups alcoholics anonymous gambling

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
and biker gang groups

221
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,880
our methodology includes utilizing

222
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,279
keywords to identify candidate sensitive

223
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
groups

224
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,200
and we then prune low activity and

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,880
unrelated groups

226
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,399
finally we identified about 31 000 such

227
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
groups

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
and for these groups around

229
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
40 to 50 percent of the users post at

230
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,440
least one sensitive or common pattern

231
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
note while the rest try to hide their

232
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
membership by posting unrelated notes

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,680
however all the users get affected

234
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
other concerns and recommendations

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
so what happens is that when a user

236
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
installs venmo app it would ask the user

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
to import contacts if the user agrees

238
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,519
their contact

239
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,080
will become visible friends on venmo

240
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
this is not ideal because for example a

241
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
user could be calling their doctor to

242
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
find out about their test results or

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
or a user might be having a private

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
relationship with someone and don't want

245
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
to disclose it publicly

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
so they will be publicly visible as

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
friends on venmo which the user wouldn't

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
want to happen

249
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
moreover we also found inconsistencies

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
with friends list visibility

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,279
and and public feeds even after

252
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,920
users set them as private across the

253
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,399
different venmo apis

254
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,880
our responsible disclosure regarding the

255
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,839
same

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,240
to when mo and paypal helped them fix

257
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,519
these issues in november 2021.

258
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,839
we also identified scams phishing

259
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,160
accounts and users sharing personal

260
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,959
documents via venmo notes

261
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
finally our recommendations are for user

262
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
actions users should immediately make

263
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
private all their past present and

264
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
future transactions

265
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
and their friends list

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
for venmo they should consider private

267
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
by default settings

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,399
so from a user safety point of view

269
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
private by default is the best policy

270
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,839
further users should also have full

271
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,079
control of their profiles so this

272
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,680
feature should be added

273
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
to enable users to fully control their

274
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,959
privacy settings

275
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
conclusions our large-scale analysis

276
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,320
highlights serious risks from a public

277
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,480
by default policy for mobile social

278
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
payments

279
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
as most users don't have

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,519
either the technical literacy to change

281
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,000
default privacy settings or the

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
awareness of what their information

283
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,200
leaks can do over time

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
so public by default model poses real

285
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,040
privacy risks for users platforms with

286
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,760
public feeds have a duty of care to

287
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,160
monitor unintended risks in these shared

288
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
data

289
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
thank you very much for listening to

290
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
this talk

291
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,760
questions please
