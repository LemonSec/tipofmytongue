00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,800
hi everyone i'm iman fued and today i'm

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
happy to present you part of our work on

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,960
detection measurement and lawfulness of

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,240
cookie spawning with browser

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,760
fingerprinting

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,280
we define copyright spawning with

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,960
browser fingerprinting as the

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,040
combination of both stateful and second

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,199
tracking techniques so before presenting

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,960
our work let me start with a small

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
introduction on how stateful and

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,880
simplest tracking techniques work

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,279
stateful tracking relies on the usage of

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,840
browser storages such as cookies

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
to better understand how it works let's

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,320
consider a user browsing the web

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,640
the user is visitingbbc.com that

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
includes content from doubleclick

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
in order to fetch the content the

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,160
browser will automatically send the

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
request to doubleclick

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
using the request response doubleclick

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
will set a cookie on the user's browser

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,520
with as value the identifier one two

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
three four

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,399
now the user visits a different website

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,399
let's say new yorktimes.com that

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
includes content from the same domain

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,920
doubleclick

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
again a request is sent to doubleclick

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
to fetch the content and along with the

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,320
request the browser automatically

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,680
attached to cookie id equal 1234

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
using this identifier doubleclick can

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,080
recognize the user and recreate her

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
browsing history

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
setlist tracking or what is commonly

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,479
known as fingerprinting allows tracking

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,880
using browser and machine features

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,479
this time it's assumed that new york

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
times include a fingerprinting script

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
from doubleclick

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240
the script access a number of user and

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
users browsing machine features such as

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,799
timezone and resolution then send back

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
the data to doubleclick

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
along with their quest doubletaker sees

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
additional features referred to as

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,399
passive features that are automatically

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
attached to the request such as user

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
agent

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
using this information doubleclick can

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,560
generate a fingerprint in that example

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,079
fp456

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,720
associated to the user or group of users

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
and then similarly to what we have seen

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
in statewide tracking use this

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,320
identifier to create users browsing

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,079
history

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,399
for simplicity in the following we refer

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
to this process of fingerprinting as

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,199
this error to sum up we've seen that we

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,200
have two big categories of tracking

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
state 4 that relies on the user's

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
browser storages such as cookie storage

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,599
it's a simple way to track users however

67
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,440
it requires storages

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
stateless tracking that relies on the

69
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
user's browser and machine features

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
it does not require any storage but it's

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,520
not stable over time

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
several studies measured the prevalence

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
of stateful and seedless tracking

74
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
techniques separately

75
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
however to the best of our knowledge

76
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
none of these works studied the

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,720
combination of both tracking techniques

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
in this work we study how trackers can

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
combine the two tracking techniques and

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
take advantage of the best of the two

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
worlds

82
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
as you might know today we're moving

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
toward the application of third party

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,760
cookies

85
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
in this study we show how cookies

86
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
spawning with browser fingerprinting can

87
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
overcome the duplication of their party

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,239
cookies and still ensure resistant

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
tracking

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
finally we study the privacy and legal

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
application of distracting behavior with

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
the help of an evil folder so how

93
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
quickly respawning with browser

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
fingerprinting works

95
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
let's go back to our example the user is

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
with cmbc.com let's have the fingerprint

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
inscription double-click a request is

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
sent to doubleclick along with the

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
browser and machine features double

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
generate the fingerprint fp456

101
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
and then store it on the matching table

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
with the corresponding identifier let's

103
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
say one two three four

104
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
double click will then send back a

105
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
response and certificate on the user's

106
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,799
browser with s value one two three four

107
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
now let's say that the user cleans her

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
browser including cookie storages and

109
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,040
revisit the bbc.com website let's still

110
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,840
include description down click

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,599
our quest once again is sent to double

112
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
click that regenerate the same thinking

113
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,000
print fp456

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
check the matching table

115
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
extract the corresponding identifier one

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,560
two three four and sets back the cookie

117
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,519
with the same id1234 on the user's stock

118
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,680
and user's browser storage

119
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
now how to study cookie responding with

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
browser fingerprinting in the one

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,519
in the following i'll summarize our

122
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,879
methodology

123
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
for this work we studied alexa 30k

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,360
websites for every website we make a

125
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
first call that we refer to as initial

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,159
clock

127
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
then we clean all browser switches

128
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,238
including cookie storage open a new

129
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
browser instance and perform a second

130
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
call that we refer to as reappearance

131
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
call

132
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,040
using these two first calls with the

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
cookies that are recreated with the same

134
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
value after we cleaned the browser

135
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
storages

136
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,320
to discard cookies that appear

137
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
systematically with the same value in

138
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
every row we perform the third call from

139
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,479
a different machine that we refer to as

140
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,560
user specific code

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
and so as a result of this first step we

142
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
collected the cookies that reappeared

143
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,479
the same value when we revisit the same

144
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,880
website on the same machine

145
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
and are additionally user specific

146
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
meaning that the value of this cookie is

147
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
changed when we call from a different

148
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
machine

149
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
we refer to this set of cookies as

150
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
respond user specific cookies next we

151
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
analyze the dependency between the

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,280
response cookie and the study

153
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
fingerprinting features

154
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
for simplicity let's take the example of

155
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
the cookie ideo1234 that appears on

156
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
bbc.com

157
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,639
let's say that the question we want to

158
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,000
answer is whether the cookie is

159
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
dependent on ip address

160
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400
the logic is simple if you want to prove

161
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
the dependency between the cookie and

162
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,160
the feature what we can do is change the

163
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
play of the feature and check whether

164
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
the cookie is changing as well

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
to add certainty we can set the feature

166
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,240
to its initial value and check if the

167
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
cookie is back to initial value

168
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
we spoke to ip address that user pointed

169
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,280
to a different location and we visited

170
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,800
the bbc.com website several times

171
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
we mark in a red class the visits where

172
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
we detect that the value of the key1234

173
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,800
changed

174
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
otherwise we mark it in a great pass

175
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
and repeated that several times

176
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
similarly we set the ip address initial

177
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
value and check if the cookie is set to

178
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
its initial value one two three four if

179
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
it's the case for marketing a green plus

180
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,039
otherwise mark the website visits as a

181
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,240
red cross

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
and we repeated that separate times

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
again

184
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
next we perform the statistical test

185
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
permutation tests and we consider that

186
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
the cookie is ip dependent if it's

187
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,080
statistically significant

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,520
as a result of this study we detected

189
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,039
1425 cookies that are respond using at

190
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
least one of the studied features had to

191
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,960
mention that in our work we considered

192
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
eight fingerprinting features you can

193
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,400
always refer to the paper for more

194
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
details

195
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,479
we found that this cookie is at here on

196
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,800
1105 visited websites now i'll present

197
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
part of our result on what features are

198
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
used for spawning and what categories of

199
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
websites we detect such behavior and

200
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
what are the tracking and new

201
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,039
consequences of cookie spawning with

202
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,400
buzzer finger printing

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
among the eight studied fingerprinting

204
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
features we found that the ip address is

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
the top feature used to respond cookies

206
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,759
in fact 25 percent of cookies are

207
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,400
respond using ipads alone

208
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
we categorize the websites where we

209
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
detected responding and we found that

210
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
responding is happening over 140

211
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,759
different categories

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,440
news websites is the top category of

213
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
websites including google spawning in

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
fact among the visited websites 5.95

215
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
percent of news websites contained at

216
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
least one respond cookies

217
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,680
finally we found that responding is also

218
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
happening on sensitive websites such as

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,479
adult websites we detected 21

220
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,319
instances that are respond on such

221
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
websites

222
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
as we mentioned earlier browsers are

223
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
moving toward the duplication of their

224
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,639
particular keys however we found that

225
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,840
cookie spawning with browser

226
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
fingerprinting can enable persistent

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
cost like tracking even after the

228
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
removal of the particular keys

229
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,759
let's consider this example

230
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
the user is visitingbbc.com that

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
includes a fingerprinting script from

232
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,840
idxs.com

233
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
a request is sent to idxs along with the

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
browser and machine features at inaccess

235
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
extract the fingerprint fp456 and store

236
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
it on a matching table with a

237
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
corresponding identifier one two three

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
four

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
then it will send back the id to add an

240
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,280
excess script that will store the id in

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,599
the first party cookie

242
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,280
next let's say that the user visits new

243
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
york times dot com that includes a

244
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
sketch from the idxs

245
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
so once again a request is centered at

246
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,319
access with the browse and machine

247
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
features at the excess check the

248
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
matching table extract the corresponding

249
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,919
identifier 1-3-4

250
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,520
with square planner in the context of

251
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
new york times.com we store a second

252
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
first particular key with the id1234

253
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
as a result on the user's browser will

254
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
have two first party cookies set by

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
adding excess with different costs and

256
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
same value

257
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
using these cookies adenix says can

258
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
ensure persistent cost side tracking

259
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
without relying on their party cookies

260
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
we detected 40 response first

261
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
ratification instances that are set by

262
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
same domain on different websites and

263
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,959
sharing the same value

264
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
this could be considered for cost like

265
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
tracking

266
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
with the help of a legal scholar we

267
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
evaluated the legal consequences of

268
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
cookie and spawning with browser

269
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
fingerprinting

270
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
we found that cookie spawning violates a

271
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
number of principles first furnace

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
principle the furnace principle mandates

273
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
that personal data must be processed

274
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
fairly

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
that is we should not have any

276
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,279
surprising effects the recreation of

277
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,200
cookies after being removed is indeed a

278
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
surprising effect for users

279
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,320
therefore all

280
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,839
1425 response cookies are violating

281
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,480
defense principle

282
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
next we evaluated the transparency

283
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
principle that mandates that personal

284
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
data processing must be handled in a

285
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
transparent manner

286
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
we analyze the top 10 popular response

287
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
cookies owners policies and we found

288
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
that none of them is actually mentioning

289
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
the usage of cochlear spawning

290
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
finally we found that cookie spraying

291
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,279
advisory fingerprinting violates the

292
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,200
lawfulness principle

293
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
the lawfulness principle mandates that

294
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,760
websites should obtain user's content

295
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,839
i have to mention that in our study we

296
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,920
never consent to cookies

297
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
however not all cookies are subject to

298
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,519
consent

299
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
to evaluate whether he

300
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,760
is violating their non-famous principle

301
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
or not we extracted the purposes of

302
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
respond cookies

303
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
and we found that 38.69

304
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,399
of the respond cookies are indeed

305
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
subject to consent and therefore

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
violating the lawfulness principle

307
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
as we mentioned earlier not all cookies

308
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
are subject to concept in fact there is

309
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,040
three criteria used to evaluate whether

310
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
a cookie is exempted or subject to

311
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,760
consent the purpose of the cookie the

312
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
duration whether it's a session or

313
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
persistent cookie and finally the

314
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
context whether it's a first or third

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
party cookie

316
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
we found that cookie spawning with

317
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,839
browser thinker printing can actually

318
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
bypass the criteria used to identify the

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
need of user's content

320
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,399
in fact

321
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,399
31.30 of the respond cookies are session

322
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,440
cookies

323
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
these cookies can be exempted from

324
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,959
consent because of their duration the

325
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,040
fact that there are succession cookies

326
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
however because of the usage of

327
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
correspondence by the fingerprinting

328
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,640
these cookies are used in a persistent

329
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,800
way

330
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
to conclude in this work we designed a

331
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
methodology that helped identify which

332
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
features are used to respond cookies

333
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
we performed the first study on cookie

334
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
spawning with browser fingerprinting and

335
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,560
we showed that this tracking technique

336
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
overcome the duplication of third-party

337
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
cookies and each were persistent costs

338
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
like tracking

339
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
finally performed the legal analysis and

340
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
shown that cookie is spawning with

341
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
