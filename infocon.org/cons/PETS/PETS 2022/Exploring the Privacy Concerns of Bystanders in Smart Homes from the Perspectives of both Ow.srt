00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,000
hello everyone my name is ahmed sheri

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
i'm presenting on behalf of the other

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,120
co-authors our paper titled exploring

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
the price concerns of bystanders in

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
smart homes from both perspectives

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,839
owners and bystanders

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,560
we are all affiliated with the colorado

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,480
school of mines from golden colorado

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,439
um

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,000
this slide is not really important to

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,760
audience like you you know privacy very

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,238
well i'm assuming everyone like has some

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,640
sort of experience researching it but

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,160
let's talk about

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,719
some definitions um

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
we really know that privacy definition

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
or perspective differs from person to

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,840
person country to country content

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
content or region to region

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
they don't like all agree about the same

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
definition but

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
some bases

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,440
kind of agree about privacy can be

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
someone's right to

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
keep their personal life private and

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,559
secret information privacy is the right

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,400
to control

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,680
your data

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
uh and how is it gonna be collected or

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,520
shared

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,880
it's getting more complicated as

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
technology technologies advance um

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
but let's start with this and i really

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,240
would like to mention

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,119
also privacy is considered fundamental

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,720
human rights recognized by the united

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
nations

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,640
this is

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,759
this is very important because

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,040
knowing that

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,840
it's

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,240
uh it's more than one region in one

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,840
country because most of the time user

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
studies are done in in one region

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,640
however this can tell us that

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,880
the majority of the people

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
have similar concerns

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
and i highlighted the

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,119
one of the regulations here i'm

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
mentioning um because it affects the

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,960
state i'm residing in right now colorado

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
and i'm kind of proud of the recent

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,439
policy and regulations regarding

54
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,159
personal privacy uh it is important to

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
know on research privacy because it

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,159
could prevent or delay innovation and

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,560
growth in any industry and we really

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
want to tackle that so we can have great

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,800
smart home technologies

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,959
why is research about privacy important

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,840
um

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
probably i don't need to tell you but

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
i'm just gonna

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
take a shot

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040
we really want the utility of these

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
smart home devices um i read an article

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
recently about um

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
a neighborhood in california where crime

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
was

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
decreased the rate of crime decreased 50

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,959
by 50 by only asking people to have a

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,680
smart doorbell and so there's a

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
significant

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,519
utility we want to utilize and we want

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
to keep but at the same time we want to

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
address privacy so we can really have

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
that great privacy friendly technologies

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
um

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,440
also the last number i want to talk

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,400
about is it is anticipated that

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
there will be 375

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
million smart homes by 2024 and this is

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
important because a home is not resided

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
by one person usually by two three four

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
so multiply this number by by three four

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,879
five if you will

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,680
so the the impact is huge

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
the technologies are emerging dynamic

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
and has high potential dynamic is

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
important because we want to steer the

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,800
wheel to the privacy friendly kind of

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
technology

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,400
um

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,440
some of the concerns in smart homes

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
in regards to privacy

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
i didn't mean to list all the concerns

97
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
but those are kind of like big concerns

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
and we focus on the multi-user

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,679
environment

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
perspective if you will

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,599
some definitions so we can really like

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,400
follow my presentation very well as

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,959
smart homes are any home any smart home

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,080
device that

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
is able to connect to the internet so

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,360
collecting data from the physical world

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
and transfer it to the internet owners

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,159
we mean the main users of these devices

109
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,799
who can control them and bystanders we

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
have more than one type so i mentioned

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
in this slide two types and i will focus

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,480
on the second type only because that's

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
what we actually

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
considered in our paper

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,319
the people who are not living in the

116
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
smart home but could be visiting so they

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,320
don't have access they don't have

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,199
control likes as family members friends

119
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
or domestic workers

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
data practices

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
um

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
has three parts collection how is the

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,199
data collected how is the data stored

124
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
and then how is the data shared

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
i would like to emphasize that we focus

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
on how owners share data with others we

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,440
don't focus of how companies or cloud

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
services share data with third parties

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
or others that's an additional layer to

130
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
the problem and is

131
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,479
indeed worth exploring if someone wants

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,160
to take a lead and go after that

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
so in a visual representation

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
so imagine you're you're visiting your

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
friend you're the bystander and your

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
friend has smart home devices you're you

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
don't have control over your data

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
and you don't usually consent so it's

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
like the two kind of pillars of privacy

140
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
are missing um

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,600
and we want to understand this from

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
owner's perspective like do they think

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
other people have privacy concerns in

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,800
their home and we want to understand

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
from bystander perspective when they go

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
to other people's homes and also it's

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,639
major we want to explore the willingness

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
to negotiate because if like let's say

149
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
like they both agree there is a privacy

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
right or concern for the bystanders and

151
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
how can how can we reach an agreement

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,759
how we can find a common ground and so

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,199
on

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,000
so

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
briefly about the related work we are

156
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
not the first to look at the bystander

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,639
privacy but we claim to be the first to

158
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
look from that kind of angle

159
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
the first group of papers looked at the

160
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,759
bystander privacy from one perspective

161
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,759
only which is like their perspective

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
themselves so

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
we argue

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
these papers are great i have nothing

165
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
against them but we argue that if we

166
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,039
don't include the owner's perspective

167
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,440
we're missing actionable items so

168
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
because if the bystander has a privacy

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
concern and the owner are not willing to

170
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
address that concern

171
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
the owners are still the privacy of the

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,479
decision makers and nothing might happen

173
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,199
the other part the other group of papers

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
are privacy tools in public places like

175
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,199
campuses downtowns supermarkets

176
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
expectation of privacy are differ

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
between

178
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,080
smart homes and public places

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,759
third um

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
in an airbnb setting it's actually a

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
paper that was published in a previous

182
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
proceeding of pets

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
um i can't remember if it was last year

184
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
or 2020.

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
um airbnb guests and hosts don't usually

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,360
stay together

187
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
they don't usually have trust

188
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
established between each other like

189
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
friends or families

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,759
and

191
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,560
they don't like at the minimum airbnb

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
requires

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
hosts to

194
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,120
disclose if they have smart cameras like

195
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
just one type of smart homes so there's

196
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,599
different situations that's what we're

197
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
claiming to

198
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
how we want to fill the gap in the

199
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,479
research the main contribution we want

200
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
to explore from both perspective because

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,360
we

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,199
we want to see the concerns and we want

203
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
to see how what we can do about it and

204
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
we want to provide recommendations and

205
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
and to the smart home vendors and

206
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
manufacturers and researchers

207
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
i'm coming from the computer science

208
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
background so of course i'm gonna look

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
at the technical solution first uh

210
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,599
excuse that approach but that's how we

211
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,199
kind of like programmed to think most of

212
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,680
the times um so

213
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
we actually built a raspberry pi that

214
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
raspberry pi collects the devices that's

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,879
connected to the network and goes after

216
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,720
their privacy policy and pull all of

217
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
them and display them to anyone who

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
walks into our lab we did that

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
as an experiment then we realize we

220
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
don't actually understand

221
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
what people

222
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
what people's concerns are and what

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,840
they're willing to negotiate then we

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
took a step back and said okay let's

225
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
explore user study and see what we can

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,759
do about it then we go back to the

227
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
technical solution um

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
the raspberry pi is still in the lab by

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
the way

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,520
um so we designed a study and if you're

231
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,039
an owner you're going to be asked a

232
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,479
different set of questions and if you're

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,680
a bystander you're going to be asking

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
different specific questions and towards

235
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
the end we can ask the same questions

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,199
for both to kind of explore the

237
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
negotiable data practices between owners

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
and bystanders the yellow rectangles

239
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,200
here are

240
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
partially unique to our studies so other

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,799
people have explored them but we kind of

242
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,958
like fed them to be like give a holistic

243
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
picture and the grey we claim to be

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,080
unique in our study

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
um

246
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
so and this is like briefly a

247
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,959
demographic about our participants you

248
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,720
can refer to the paper if you want more

249
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
detail about it um

250
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,160
so

251
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
in our questions or um in our study we

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
asked two different questions open-ended

253
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
questions and closing the question and

254
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
this is important because if the problem

255
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,720
is new

256
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
you want to ask open ended and see what

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
people say and we really want to utilize

258
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,040
that so we use we use the mapping

259
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
analysis to build our code book and uh

260
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
and for the open-ended questions and we

261
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
used

262
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,120
answer distribution with a subject

263
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
comparison and between subject

264
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
comparison for the clause and the

265
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
questions okay

266
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
going to the finding we have three major

267
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
parts for the finding the first is for

268
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
the owners then for the bystanders then

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
for both which is the negotiable data

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
practices then we'll move to the

271
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
recommendations

272
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
um so

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,240
just a snippet of what we found um

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
slight majority of owners recognized by

275
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,760
standard privacy right because if they

276
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
don't recognize privacy rights there's

277
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
nothing we can do about it so that's

278
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
really important the second part here is

279
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
really like interesting so 80 percent of

280
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,800
owners would not disclose

281
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,760
and we looked deeper into why

282
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
and we found that owners themselves

283
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
don't understand what they data

284
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
types are being collected in their own

285
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,959
smart home

286
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,760
and that's a really major and and if we

287
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,839
don't try to help owners understand the

288
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
data practices like we might actually

289
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
not be able to solve the bystander

290
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,560
privacy uh issue at all um

291
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,600
and and also like owners are willing to

292
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
address privacy concern of family

293
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
members and friends more than others so

294
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
the social relationship matter in this

295
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
situation and we did

296
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
analyze this and we found the

297
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
differences to be statistically

298
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
significant

299
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
and by from the bystander perspective

300
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
and we found that

301
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,279
the majority of bystander feel concerns

302
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,399
and

303
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,640
and that is not different when we tested

304
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,440
if

305
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
if the exposure to smart homes d um uh

306
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
make by standard think differently for

307
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
example if a bystander had been to a

308
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,040
smart home so they understand it more

309
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
would they have a different concern or

310
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,680
not and we didn't find any

311
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,519
statistical significant difference which

312
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
means like all by standard kind of have

313
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,360
privacy concerns regardless if they had

314
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,560
been or not

315
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
um i want to like uh emphasize the

316
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
second point which is very interesting

317
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
it's like buy some do not expect owner

318
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,880
and uh

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
the reason why

320
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
because they think that by standard uh

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
owners do not understand

322
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
their own data practices that uh in the

323
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
first place so they would not be able to

324
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
explain to buy stuff to bystanders so

325
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
that was very interesting aligning

326
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
perfectly with the previous slide

327
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
and we want to move to the negotiable

328
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
part and go far like where we want to

329
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
find common ground between owners and by

330
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
standard and we want we kind of ask the

331
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,640
same set of questions about collection

332
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
storage and sharing and the the storage

333
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,279
has the

334
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
the shortest um

335
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
gap because they're all different and

336
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,519
the answer distribution between all of

337
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,279
these questions were statistically

338
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
significant

339
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,519
but

340
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,680
we kind of like really give inside where

341
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
you can develop solutions for the future

342
