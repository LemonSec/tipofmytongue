welcome to our talk leave no data

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,759
behinds empirical insights into data

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,320
eraser from online services

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,960
my name is imanil simudis i'm a phd

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,400
student at the technical university of

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,440
munich

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,200
and this study is a joint work with

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,920
eduardop and hence koslux were also at

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
the technical university of munich

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
in 2018 the general data protection

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
regulation came into force in the

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,279
european union

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,199
and it introduced a set of user rights

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,279
that aim to give users more control over

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,040
their data

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
this study focuses on the right to

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,719
erasure also known as the right to be

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,920
forgotten

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,840
it allows users to request the erasure

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
of their personal data from online

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
services

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
we already know from empirical studies

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,320
on other user rights

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
that the compliance of online services

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
with regard to user rights of the gdpr

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
is in general rather low

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,120
for instance in 2021

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,039
we conducted an empirical study on the

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,879
right to data portability

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,879
where we found a compliance rate

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,438
of only 29 of online services who

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,200
fulfill all the requirements of the

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,000
right to date affordability

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,080
so we're now asking with regard to the

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,680
right to erasure

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
how do data controllers deal with data

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
erasure in practice

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
and what are the implications for data

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
subjects

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
to answer this main research question we

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
look into different aspects of data

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,839
erasure

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,880
we first look into what kind of data can

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,200
users of websites easily

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,720
easily delete within their accounts

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
without deleting the

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
complete account

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,079
then under what circumstances and in

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
which ways can users exercise their

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
right to erasure

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
is the request of an account deletion

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
within the account for instance while

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,360
pressing a button equivalent to sending

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
the data protection officer a formal

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
right to erasure request

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,799
then how do the data controllers respond

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,759
to this data deletion requests

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
and finally what kind of data remains

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,840
after a successful data deletion

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
request we can't cover all of these

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,920
questions within this short talk so i

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,319
will focus on the main findings of the

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,000
study

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
so to give you some more background

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
article 17 of the gdpr allows users to

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
have their personal data deleted from

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
online services under certain

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
circumstances

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
that is for instance if that data is not

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
needed anymore

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
for processing payments or something

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,200
like that

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,800
in addition gdpr also features article 6

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
the lawfulness of processing

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
which restricts services to only process

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,239
data when the user has given content all

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
the processing is necessary for other

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,399
purposes

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,160
so when it comes to the right to erasure

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
in contrast to other user rights we

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,599
could not directly observe whether

82
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
services are compliant with this right

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
or not so for the rights to data

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,800
portability

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
one can simply request the exports of

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,840
the data and then look into the data

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
export if it fulfills all the

88
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,879
requirements

89
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
we of course can't look into the service

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
of the online services so we had to go

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,959
with a more of an

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,920
uh

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800
exploratory approach here

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
so to collect as much information as

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,360
possible on the data erasure practices

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
of online services

97
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
we went for a two-stage process

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
in the first stage we created accounts

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,760
at 90 popular online services

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,080
which were taken from the similar web

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,680
ranking we used similar web in order to

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,159
have accounts at a variety of different

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,640
types of services

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,840
then over a period of six weeks

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
we manually feed its data

106
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,560
into these accounts to make sure that

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
each of the accounts features a a rich

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
variety of data that

109
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,599
can then later hopefully be deleted

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,319
then after at least six weeks

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,560
we requested the data erasure from the

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
online service

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
we tried to make this as similar to as a

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
normal user would do

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,040
so

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
when we found a dedicated button for

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,519
this data eraser eraser which for

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
instance could be called delete account

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
or some something similar

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
we use that button or a request form

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,320
if there was no button or request form

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
we send an email with a formal request

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
under article 17 gdpr to request the

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
erasure of our personal data

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,440
so after this process was done

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
we waited for six months or even longer

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,800
so we made sure that at least six months

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
were we're gone

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
we then requested

130
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
an export of our data under article 15

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,919
gdpr which is the right of access so

132
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
this right

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,639
gives the user the right to receive the

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
information the service has about them

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
so requested to get this copy of our

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
data and then looked into it to see

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
is there data remaining that should have

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
been deleted before

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
to gain even more insights we send

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,759
follow-up emails to the services that

141
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,720
did not delete or anonymize all data

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
correctly

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
we analyze the privacy policies of the

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
services on information about the data

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,919
deletion process

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,600
and we send the questionnaire to all

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
data protection officers of the services

148
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
in the sample

149
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
the graph on this slide shows the

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
cumulative distribution of total

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
deletion times

152
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
that is the time from the initial

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
request until the data was finally

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
deleted

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,280
all but three of the 90 services

156
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,160
responded to our erasure requests from

157
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,639
the three services that did not respond

158
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,520
to

159
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,319
erase the data anyway but of course

160
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,840
these services are not included in the

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
graph as we cannot say how long the

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,560
erasure exactly took

163
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,520
so we found that around 50 of services

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
erased the data on the day of the

165
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
request

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,639
the mean deletion time in our sample was

167
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,000
10.8 days

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
notably for 28

169
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,120
of services

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,520
there was a transition period

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
after we

172
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,680
requested the erasure which was between

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,880
7 and 90 days

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
19 services

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,759
explicitly stated that within this

176
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
transition periods the erasure can be

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
cancelled

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
for instance such cancer cancellation

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,560
can

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
take place by logging into the account

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
and then the erasure is automatically

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,120
cancelled

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,560
this table gives an overview of our

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
results

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,840
we found three different ways in which

186
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,919
services could violate the terms of

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
article 17.

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
first there were services which still

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
sent us a newsletter after the account

190
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
was deleted

191
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
note that we never

192
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
separately signed up for a newsletter

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
but

194
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,199
indicated our interest or interest in

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
receiving a newsletter by for instance

196
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,240
by a check mark within the account

197
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
then there were instances where public

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,440
data was not deleted or anonymized

199
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
so where possible we created public

200
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
posts or tweets or whatever

201
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,599
and then after the eraser found that for

202
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
instance for for all services for 27 of

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
services this public data was not

204
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,639
sufficiently deleted or anonymized that

205
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
is for instance our name was still over

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
it

207
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,840
then there were services where we

208
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
received a positive

209
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,720
response to our article 15 requests so

210
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
these were the requests under the

211
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
right of access

212
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
so these services still responded with

213
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
our personal data more than six months

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
after we made the erasure requests

215
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
all in all we find that for 73 percent

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
of services

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,639
that they could be marked as compliant

218
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
so we could not find non-combined

219
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,360
behavior of these of these services

220
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
percent of services where there was the

221
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,919
possibility to sign up for a newsletter

222
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
still send us a newsletter

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
27 percent of services where we could

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,879
create public posts

225
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,840
did not delete or anonymize that posts

226
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
and 16 of all services

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
send us a positive article 15 request

228
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
notably

229
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
is the difference in request methods

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,839
as stated earlier where possible we

231
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,679
requested the eraser by the click of a

232
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,240
button and only if that was not possible

233
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
we send an email with a formal article

234
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
17 request

235
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
we found that only 9 69 of services

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
where the button was used for the eraser

237
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,279
are compliance

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,800
whereas 82 percent where we uh submitted

239
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
the request via where we submitted a

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,959
formal request using an email very

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
compliant so we so this

242
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,200
leads to a significant difference in

243
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
request methods

244
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,920
regarding the country or the popularity

245
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
of services we could not find

246
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
significant differences

247
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,200
as seen in the table

248
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
there is a significant difference

249
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,920
between

250
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
data erasure which is requested via the

251
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,760
click of a button

252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,040
versus the

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,519
erasure which is requested via a formal

254
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,360
article 17 request

255
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
where the non-compliance rates are 31

256
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,120
and 18 respectively

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
this leads to the question should these

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
types of data erasure erasure wire

259
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
button

260
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,839
and erasure via formal requests be

261
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,399
treated in the same way

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,080
we asked this question the data

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
protection officers and received mixed

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,839
answers some explicitly said yes to

265
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,399
use your rights under article 17 please

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,760
use the

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
erasure method that is given within your

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
account others said no we don't treat

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,399
this in the same way

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
we also analyze the privacy policies but

271
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
they mostly contain no details on the

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,760
deletion process that is what data will

273
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,000
exactly be deleted when making this

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
request

275
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
so

276
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
one argument

277
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,279
in favor of treating this the same

278
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,880
is that from a user's perspective

279
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
users typically will use that buttons so

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
so if they aren't treated in the same

281
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,399
way

282
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
online services have the incentive

283
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
to offer that buttons in order to be

284
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
able to keep more data which goes

285
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,959
against the intentions of the gdpr

286
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
in addition gdpr also features its

287
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,360
article 6 which forbids processing

288
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
without content unless necessary and one

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
could argue that when a user requests

290
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,000
the eraser of their account

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
then this might be interpreted also as

292
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
revoking his or her content to the data

293
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
processing

294
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
so to wrap up

295
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
we find that at least 27 percent of

296
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
online services are not compliant with

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
the provisions of gdpr's article 17

298
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,720
right to erasure

299
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,399
in particular we find that there is a

300
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,880
higher heterogeneity in the practices of

301
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
online services

302
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,040
it's this makes it difficult for users

303
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,839
to execute their rights and in addition

304
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,920
in most cases user users receive no

305
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,519
information on the scope of the erasure

306
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,880
so we'd propose two improvements

307
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
on the one hand

308
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
services should receive guidelines by

309
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
the legislator

310
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,519
on how to implement this rights to

311
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,640
erasure

312
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
and this regulation should be enforced

313
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,079
more strictly

314
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,720
then from a user's perspectives

315
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
data erasure the methods for data

316
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
erasure requests should be accessible

317
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
more easily

318
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
and services should be obliged to

319
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
provide more information about the

320
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
process itself

321
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,360
so

322
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
that's concludes our talk

323
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,959
thank you very much for your attention
