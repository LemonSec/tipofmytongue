11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,160

opportunity to help shape this

conference I'm very happy to see many

26

which govern this uh conference and I

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,240
can start with this slide right away

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,479
so the pet board if we yeah there it is

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,220
uh the pet board is the governing

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,040
body uh for

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,700
uh the pet conference and the pole pets

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,720
journal the proceedings of pets uh you

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,479
can see its composition uh on on this

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,340
website

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,700
um it invites the program chairs and the

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,880
general chairs which usually provide a

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,220
nice proposal as Dali has done here for

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,000
wonderful Sydney

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,920
um and uh we are actually looking for

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,159
proposals for 2024 so if you are

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,540
interested

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,299
um approach me or somebody else you

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,639
trust from the board

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,640
um and uh together the program chairs

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,540
and the general chairs uh organize the

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,879
conference including paper selection by

48
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,239
the program committee and uh chaired by

49
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,000
the program chairs and other logistics

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
of all of these things that go into this

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
event uh in the um

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,420
case uh for the conference and then

53
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,480
they'll join the pet board I don't think

54
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,459
uh the pet board has a terms of

55
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,200
reference

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,180
um but you will if you ever become

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,920
program chair General chair you will see

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,620
and the idea is here for the pet board

59
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,300
to get a little bit of feedback from the

60
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,099
audience from from the people who

61
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,980
actually make up the conference and see

62
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,800
what it did

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
so I want to start with a little bit of

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
an updated slide that was presented by

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,620
me at the last Town Hall in 2021 when I

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,480
was

67
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,300
entering my second year of

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,519
um PC chairing and uh I said in 2022

69
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,120
we're gonna have a few changes one was

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,800
the introduction of the senior program

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,060
committee

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,640
uh another one was the review feedback

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,739
process

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,200
um and an Essex process which was

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,680
introduced for issue two and uh strongly

76
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
LED uh by uh Michelle and she's going to

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
talk about that more

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,140
and uh the self-publishing process sort

79
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,440
of Came Upon Us it was not announced but

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
it sort of happened and Michelle and I

81
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,739
thought we should talk a little bit

82
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,580
about that too

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,060
um

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,760
the increase in papers were so that

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,459
Michelle and I thought

86
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,040
um we don't necessarily need an increase

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,439
in the program committee as was

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,099
necessary in 2021 uh when the number of

89
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,459
papers jumped very much for issue three

90
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,239
um

91
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,959
I have a suspicion why that is the case

92
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,120
uh but I don't have any any data and

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,478
it's still increased by 25 but more in a

94
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,899
steady rate

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,000
all right so let's jump into the

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
individual changes and start with the

97
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,620
senior program committee so the senior

98
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,240
program committee

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,060
um is a selection of

100
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,580
senior members of the community who

101
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,580
write meta reviews and lead the

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,860
discussion for

103
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,440
uh the papers in in the program

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,120
committee so their task is uh in in my

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
opinion and I'm not sure if I always

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,240
communicated that very well uh is to

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
basically try to understand the

108
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,740
arguments of the reviewers and try to

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,320
make sense of that and come to a uh

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,020
recommendation for the PC chairs and

111
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,300
lead a discussion uh in that process

112
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,479
with the reviewers

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,360
and write a meta review as a summary for

114
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,500
the authors

115
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,900
uh this was a new uh thing that we

116
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,720
introduced in 2022 a little bit also due

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
to the fact that

118
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,740
um I think Aaron and I in the end had

119
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,520
150 papers already in one issue and we

120
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,039
had issues this year where we had even

121
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,699
more than that

122
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,400
um and uh then chair uh leading the

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,320
discussion on uh 75 papers is

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,759
decrease in quality and uh one of the

125
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,720
thoughts was I mean pets if you talk to

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,340
reviewers one of the things that people

127
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,080
like About Pets is that it has an

128
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,639
excellent review process

129
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,240
right so uh the the the the the the

130
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,280
review process is really what sets pets

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,500
apart and uh the intention was to

132
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,080
maintain the quality and one step was

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,500
here the program committee so when we

134
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,180
invite the program committee members in

135
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,880
2022 pretty much everybody we asked said

136
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,280
yes

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
and we estimated that it took a bit too

138
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,580
large we estimated a few people will say

139
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,280
no but pretty much no one did what I

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,340
heard from Michelle and Mika in 2023 a

141
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,780
lot of people said no

142
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,900
so it is apparently more work for senior

143
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,780
members of the community than was

144
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,280
anticipated

145
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,240
uh so that is maybe something uh that

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
thinks sticks out the other thing is

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,460
that when managing the process

148
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,120
um

149
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,479
very subjective so so no no

150
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,500
blaming or no we had a very very

151
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,199
different styles between senior PC

152
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,699
members

153
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,120
um and

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,880
uh some came to us later on at the end

155
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,680
and I was like what was I was supposed

156
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,139
to do and we really

157
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,120
didn't have the perfect answer as well

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,620
we said like okay we this is sort of the

159
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,380
things we would have expected

160
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,220
um

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,400
but uh it it is uh

162
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,639
it it was a little bit uh a little bit

163
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,919
of a difficult process

164
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,360
for us in some cases to manage this

165
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,919
um

166
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
in others other people did fantastic

167
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
jobs right I mean actually a large part

168
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,639
of people did fantastic jobs and really

169
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,460
helped the process but we need to I

170
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,759
think establish and Define this role of

171
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,340
a senior PC member more clearly right in

172
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,259
the database Community where where where

173
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,020
this is more common uh this is a

174
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,879
well-established thing but in the

175
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,280
security Community okay now CCS starts

176
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,680
with aerial chairs but they still have

177
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,919
like over a hundred paper to to deal

178
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,620
with which is simply too much

179
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,680
right

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,560
you can only deal in my opinion at most

181
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,419
with 10 papers and then one is the

182
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,160
actual one that that causes you a

183
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,780
problem and that

184
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,599
consumes enough of your time uh if you

185
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,560
want to do a really good job

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,900
uh so so let's see how this involves it

187
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,539
it is it stayed in 2023

188
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,780
and uh if anybody has any opinion on

189
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,419
that we are happy to hear that anybody

190
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,580
of the PC or anybody outside that

191
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,779
reviewed got a a meta review and has an

192
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,299
opinion about that

193
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,360
okay if not let me move on to the second

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,860
part

195
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,560
so uh in the 2020

196
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,220
pets Town Hall

197
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,260
uh somebody made a suggestion we would

198
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,700
really like

199
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,680
to have some feedback process on uh the

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
reviews

201
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,060
and I thought this could be an

202
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,820
interesting experiment how one could set

203
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,279
up a system like that of

204
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,640
um uh sort of evaluating reviews right

205
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,399
because all of us including myself I'm

206
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,899
constantly complaining about the reviews

207
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm getting

208
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,779
uh but I'm probably not getting any

209
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,260
worse reviews than anybody else

210
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,820
so so

211
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,519
um uh we wanna

212
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,000
uh we wanted to see how how one could do

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
something like this so the intention was

214
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,680
not so much to actually Implement an

215
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,800
evaluation of the reviews but more to

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,560
see whether or not or how to such a

217
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,939
system could be constructed

218
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,459
um and we asked feedback from authors

219
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,220
from the regular the reviewers so so the

220
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,200
external reviewers and the regular PC

221
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,300
and the senior PC members and the

222
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,100
questions were similar but sometimes

223
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,839
slightly different particularly in

224
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,120
question five and I will get to that

225
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,579
and uh it was basically very simply

226
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,740
collected in a Google form and it was

227
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,240
very quantitative very simple it

228
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,339
shouldn't take long uh for you to

229
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,279
complete to do something like that

230
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,100
uh we got only 1600 about a little

231
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,920
almost 1700 reviews of reviews that is

232
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,839
less than we had reviews so

233
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,420
participation was kinda low

234
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,720
if you consider that you have an author

235
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,660
probably three fellow reviewers and a

236
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,880
senior PC member who should be able to

237
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,660
give

238
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,380
feedback we should have I think at 2000

239
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,240
reviews in the worst case we should have

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,180
almost 8 000 reviews of reviews so we

241
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,800
had a typically low participation rate

242
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,380
and this is a little bit a problem with

243
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,420
the databases the sparseness of the data

244
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,980
with with the conclusions we can draw

245
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,399
but uh still I believe that that there

246
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,260
is some interesting things

247
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,180
uh in the data

248
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,060
we asked five questions and I will read

249
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,459
them the way a author would understand

250
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,060
them is uh did the reviewer even get

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,560
what you were doing in the paper did you

252
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,420
even understand what you were doing

253
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,720
uh was he nice while he told you the

254
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,339
paper is not right

255
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,980
uh

256
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,320
uh did he change his opinion after you

257
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,200
told he's not right

258
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,420
and the third one is in the end did you

259
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,399
get something out of it uh is this was

260
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,740
this a good review is this is something

261
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,660
you would write and usefulness this is

262
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,060
where this was different so uh regular

263
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,820
pc we didn't ask the question at all for

264
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,860
authors we asked was it useful to you

265
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,560
did you learn something from the and for

266
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,240
the senior PC and I think this was a

267
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,279
very important question for them it was

268
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,519
like uh how important was this in making

269
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,200
your recommendation in the end this

270
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,180
review how how much importance did you

271
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,600
place on this specific review

272
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,279
so these five questions we asked you

273
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,839
could rate them on a scale of one to

274
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,639
five

275
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,200
um for all the reviews uh that you did

276
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,660
as I said uh the the intention of this

277
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,880
was How could a review process look like

278
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,920
who should we ask

279
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,579
uh and does it have any any is there

280
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,380
anything we can discern can we actually

281
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,260
identify bad reviews or bad reviewers

282
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,899
and we promised to the PC members at the

283
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,760
beginning will not reveal at least

284
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,920
individual statistics except them if

285
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,000
they request it from us

286
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,720
so

287
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,180
I have three data points that I want to

288
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,860
present and the first one

289
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,620
is the quality score remember the five

290
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,120
questions the question about quality is

291
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,160
this a good review which was asked to

292
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,000
all uh three respondent types

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,779
and we broke it down by acceptance type

294
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,139
so on the left side you see the accepted

295
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,600
papers

296
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,220
on the middle one is the major revision

297
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,500
papers and on the right one is the

298
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
rejected papers

299
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,779
and we have in blue the authors in

300
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,040
Orange the senior PC and in uh gray the

301
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,040
reviewers and the um

302
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,680
uh PC members the regular pc members

303
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,620
that rate their fellow reviewers so

304
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,820
fundamentally you can see this the

305
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,839
average score

306
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,660
uh actually the the the the it's a

307
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,220
little bit misleading so the senior PC

308
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,139
members have an actual higher average

309
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,160
score for reviews uh for rejected papers

310
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,860
slightly higher uh than for accepted

311
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,320
papers uh in in the reviewer case it's

312
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,760
slightly lower but there's essentially

313
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,740
no difference depending on what the

314
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,680
decision type is however and it's a

315
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
little bit biased so that you can see it

316
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
but uh there is clearly clearly a bias

317
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,420
from the authors towards rating reviews

318
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,100
for paper sticker go to check that more

319
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,480
negatively

320
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,100
okay

321
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,699
so

322
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,579
yes yes for sure yes for sure it it is

323
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,019
um so so a couple of things uh it yes

324
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,300
um that the point is however the point

325
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,019
is and and the point is that if you want

326
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,420
to take their feedback into account

327
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,399
you have to somehow account for that

328
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,860
bias

329
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,279
and I have in in my third slide I have a

330
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,500
summary of uh the different of the

331
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,420
average scores per reviewer that had

332
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,639
sufficiently many reviews I just left

333
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,980
authors out because I said I have no way

334
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,779
of correcting this bias

335
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,440
right if somebody got unlucky and had a

336
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,199
whole bunch of papers uh that were just

337
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,240
had to be rejected for one reason or the

338
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,420
other and he would get a bad rating and

339
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,339
uh maybe not deserve it

340
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,740
so uh yes so so basically we need some

341
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,600
way of of dealing with this uh the other

342
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,519
thing I wanted to say actually nureps is

343
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,260
implementing a very similar experiment

344
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,260
to this one uh this year where they want

345
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,839
to see whether or not the ratings this

346
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,019
the scoring from different audiences is

347
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,060
uh reliable

348
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,399
the second one is also a very

349
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,680
interesting

350
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,600
uh slide and it shows the average score

351
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,480
per question

352
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,680
now in this case uh the authors include

353
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,139
um accepted and rejected papers so

354
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,500
therefore their scores are lower right

355
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,139
um but if I take out the the rejective

356
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,899
if I only look at accepted papers uh the

357
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,759
authors would be on it's almost the same

358
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,300
level as senior PC and reviewer for all

359
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,000
of the questions except for the rebuttal

360
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,060
did you res did the author uh did the

361
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,759
reviewer take the rebuttal into account

362
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,639
so here clearly we seem to have an issue

363
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,220
that rebuttals are not sufficiently

364
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,199
taken into account the interesting thing

365
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
however is the ones that fear see this

366
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,079
uh this um

367
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,259
deficiency the most is the senior PC

368
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,300
members who have the most opportunity to

369
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,459
do something about it at least somewhat

370
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,259
right they can remind the reviewers

371
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,899
please uh you haven't responded please

372
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,300
do something and they can escalate it to

373
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,459
the PC chairs

374
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,139
yeah so uh again this goes a little bit

375
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,420
back to the first Quest slide on senior

376
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,040
PC

377
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,259
maybe there is something

378
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:31,019
we need to do in refining that role so

379
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,259
that that middle orange bar goes up a

380
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,779
little bit and overall people respond

381
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,860
better to the rebuttals

382
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,560
and the third and last thing I wanted to

383
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,259
present is this course per review or it

384
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,940
is the only people who have a sufficient

385
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,680
number I think in this case at least

386
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,860
three three feedbacks uh to their

387
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,519
reviews and you can pretty much see that

388
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,560
a very large number

389
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,839
of reviewers is doing a good to

390
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,639
excellent job

391
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,779
yeah

392
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,780
in the eyes of only the senior PC and

393
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,299
their fellow reviewers so really a large

394
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,039
very large number of

395
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,280
uh reviewers is doing really really well

396
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,059
and fundamentally also their colleagues

397
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,919
not the people who submit papers but

398
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,980
their colleagues believe that it works

399
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,260
in the system like that however there

400
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,079
are very few in this long tail

401
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,780
we should think about

402
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,240
doing something about this right so

403
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,760
there are a few people who

404
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,220
have received scores which are

405
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,539
concerning

406
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,980
but it's not many

407
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,780
um so if I were to design a

408
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,820
recommendations uh a review of review

409
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,419
system and how to do that then

410
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,820
again my three recommendations would be

411
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,039
we need to see whether or not if we want

412
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,320
to include the authors we need to see

413
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,419
that we count for the bias against

414
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,280
rejected papers

415
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,559
we need to think about how we can use

416
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,620
those results how we can make a public

417
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,080
publicize them how we can enforce them

418
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,840
and other things that have not been done

419
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,020
in this study to its physics extent and

420
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,760
the other one is you actually want

421
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,039
system support So this Google kind of

422
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,760
form system and the long run

423
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,559
I don't think this is going to fly this

424
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,200
is my my biggest concern why I I

425
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,940
wouldn't push for it anymore it had to

426
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,679
be integrated in something like hot crap

427
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,340
which is a huge amount of work right so

428
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,220
if Hot crap ever does it then this would

429
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,660
be a great thing yes

430
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,740
sure that allows you to rate reviews but

431
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,080
that's it's it's it's pretty minimal I

432
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,000
don't know if there's any way to

433
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,919
you know make use of that

434
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,500
uh that's a good point thank you uh

435
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,039
indeed there is uh however

436
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,880
um

437
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,640
it's really difficult to

438
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
um

439
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,520
collect these statistics right over over

440
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,260
all of the reviewers

441
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,960
to enforce that the these this feedback

442
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,480
is given right it's always voluntarily

443
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,940
you cannot not do it and you have only a

444
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,179
binary you have good preview bad review

445
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:29,039
uh I think the full version by now has a

446
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,360
little bit other things like long review

447
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,600
to short review and other things

448
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
um but it is not

449
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,520
it's not

450
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,039
as I would think a system like that

451
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,380
would have to be

452
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,559
um and I I Aaron and I at the beginning

453
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,679
and and uh uh talked along about this

454
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,960
because in 2020 one we didn't give a

455
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,840
reviewer Award right

456
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,220
um and

457
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,220
the system is just

458
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,020
it's just too brittle right in the same

459
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,520
way that people people not many people

460
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,539
participated in this one like 20 right

461
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,100
uh not enough people participate even

462
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,080
less people participate in the

463
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,658
in in in the hot crap system

464
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,899
okay

465
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,740
um thanks Tariq so the question is uh

466
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,780
what if the response to the rebuttal is

467
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,940
oh it doesn't change my mind that's a

468
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,520
good question uh one thing that we could

469
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,340
think about is just putting that uh just

470
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,500
putting one or two sentences in the

471
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,820
response to the rebuttal and say like

472
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,400
thank you very much for your response uh

473
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,380
but I don't think my major concerns are

474
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,520
addressed

475
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,960
yeah and I I believe uh uh that would

476
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
already be a feedback to the authors and

477
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,900
uh uh the members uh senior PC members

478
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,280
would know that but uh again of course

479
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
um we need to see how we handle that

480
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,500
process

481
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,419
what to do about the small fraction of

482
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,340
bad reviewers I mean presumably you stop

483
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,320
assigning them papers and you don't you

484
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,059
don't invite them back I mean that's the

485
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,500
that's the traditional approach where

486
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,840
you're thinking something more than this

487
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,158
no not yet

488
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,700
um

489
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,039
so yes uh that that is that is also

490
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,440
Michelle's point right very often as as

491
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
I think also Tariq meant did this

492
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,620
comment that

493
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,220
um the uh review was read but not didn't

494
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,659
change your mind it's only made in the

495
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,640
comments and not in the battle it's in

496
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,620
the in the rebuttal itself in the review

497
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,780
itself not to rebound the review itself

498
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,659
and that is maybe something

499
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,940
we can think about uh improving

500
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
yes you can always begin right and

501
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,860
you're polite again

502
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,200
okay so so

503
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,539
um uh indeed the question the question

504
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,179
and and and uh Aaron pointed it out

505
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,659
early on is the question was uh was the

506
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,400
rebuttal it taken into account is

507
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,600
ambiguous either if there is no rebuttal

508
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,380
um or if uh the uh rebuttal was taken

509
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,500
into account in the discussion and not

510
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,720
in uh the review

511
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,799
um

512
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,700
and yes Paul tried to address this in

513
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,400
his uh

514
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,940
uh

515
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,500
meta reviews

516
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,520
okay

517
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
uh oh yeah right so quick question about

518
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,220
accounting for the bias of authors

519
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,080
um you know clearly there's this uh

520
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,860
correlation between results and uh and

521
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,460
score did you try any very simple

522
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,380
um you know just compute the average

523
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,780
score for rejected papers and then see

524
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,020
if the score was you know above or below

525
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,419
that threshold and if so does that

526
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,260
correlate with the uh

527
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,600
um with a plot you showed for

528
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,700
um I guess reviewer quality bit as

529
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,260
ranked by other peers

530
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,980
um so so we did not look

531
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,320
wait

532
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,779
no I'm not sure I got the question so I

533
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:47,880
guess uh one very simple way to to

534
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,480
normalize would just be to compare

535
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,179
um right if I if I rate my

536
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,980
um my reviews

537
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,200
um compare compare that to the average

538
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,320
score for an accepted or major revision

539
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,679
or rejected paper and

540
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,240
um then kind of like renormalize

541
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,220
determine whether that's a good score or

542
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,760
a bad score no we did not we did not

543
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,440
normalize the ratings of the Raiders

544
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,340
and that is because we have particularly

545
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,320
for authors we haven't taken them into

546
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,260
account in this in this last graph uh in

547
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,140
in this graph here right in this graph

548
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,700
authors are not

549
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,059
right

550
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,220
yeah I was just curious if if one were

551
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,440
to try to normalize it does it correlate

552
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,679
roughly with uh with this plot or would

553
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,720
I get a completely different

554
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,419
uh we can't normalize that is the other

555
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:46,919
point I want to make because we have

556
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,100
only very few feedback from from the

557
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,080
authors right so many people only

558
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,900
submitted one paper once to pets and

559
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,120
then provided feedback how am I supposed

560
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,240
to normalize them against everybody else

561
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,460
I don't think this is a fair never

562
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,720
nevertheless this is a fair

563
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,799
normalization right so so it is not such

564
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360
normalizing the the Raiders is

565
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,460
definitely something when can I try

566
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,679
but one needs larger data sets than we

567
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,640
have

568
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,220
in my opinion

569
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,480
all right

570
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
thanks one more question

571
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
behind you

572
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,539
thank you

573
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,000
so I had a short comment about bad

574
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,779
reviews

575
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,120
so it was already stated earlier that

576
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,820
when um PC members or senior PC members

577
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,380
write bad reviews than the way to cope

578
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,940
with that is maybe assign less reviews

579
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,860
to such people or maybe even exclude

580
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,640
them

581
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,740
so I also just wanted to mention that

582
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,240
there is another side to that I think

583
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,820
because if we exclude

584
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,740
um people who believe didn't do enough

585
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,220
effort for reviewing then we end up

586
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,380
um giving more reviewing work to those

587
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,679
who do a good job and then good

588
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,960
reviewers get more work and then they

589
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,580
get overworked they start writing words

590
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,220
reviews so there's a bit of this bias

591
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,679
there and I'm wondering maybe there is

592
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,059
another way to improve quality of

593
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,299
reviews apart from excluding people who

594
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,400
don't do enough effort because this way

595
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,580
we kind of put a huge bulk of work on

596
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,860
people who already do a good job so I

597
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,679
just wanted to bring that in that is

598
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,559
certainly true that is certainly true uh

599
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,679
the the load will be always carried good

600
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,120
work always means we'll work this is

601
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,880
what I tell all of my students uh Bailey

602
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,020
knows

603
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,760
um and

604
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,500
um

605
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,100
uh

606
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,159
however on the other side the system in

607
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,980
the way it currently works is that once

608
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,500
you got the email that you're in the PC

609
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,559
you basically put that on your CV you

610
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,299
have the recognition you have the fame

611
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,580
so to speak and you don't have to do

612
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,320
anything else anymore

613
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,240
yeah so the system right now works that

614
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,980
both the ones that actually do the work

615
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,140
and they do the work whether or not we

616
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,580
exclude the other ones or not or

617
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,620
um

618
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,419
uh the ones that don't do any work they

619
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,340
both get the same recognition

620
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,820
and I think that is somewhere that is

621
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,659
where we need to uh uh put the level on

622
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,279
because the people who do good work

623
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,220
should get more recognition

624
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,559
and if we then have a self-enforcing

625
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,600
cycle that we do all of the people who

626
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,899
do good work get more recognition

627
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,980
and we keep the other ones sort of out

628
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,940
then desk can this can maybe work

629
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,520
yes I see I was just thinking also from

630
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,100
the other side when somebody who the

631
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,419
chairs believe didn't do a good enough

632
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,000
job when right now these people are just

633
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
silently dropped from further

634
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
consideration so I don't think

635
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,980
necessarily this needs to be externally

636
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,620
acknowledged that the part of the PC did

637
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,720
a good job and the part didn't but if

638
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,159
there is some

639
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,820
um commonly accepted not mean way to

640
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,179
communicate that unfortunately

641
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,080
participation which is really hard

642
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,700
because this is of course voluntary

643
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,960
service

644
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,880
so yeah I just I just think there there

645
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,679
can be a wider discussion there but I

646
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,120
know that

647
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,220
um a complicated question of course yes

648
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,080
yes I mean it comes back to the question

649
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,360
of how do we enforce a system like that

650
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,120
so in this case what we did Michelle and

651
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,320
I is we took a large portion of the PC

652
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,919
this is about 30 of the regular PC and

653
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,399
30 of the senior PC and these are people

654
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,380
who have done an excellent job not just

655
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,600
a good job not just a very good job but

656
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,179
an excellent job

657
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:42,720
um

658
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,940
if your name is not on there doesn't

659
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,159
mean that you have done a bad job

660
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,620
okay I want to make that very clear

661
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,720
because simply we don't have enough data

662
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,659
to really reliably say that somebody did

663
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:55,980
a bad job

664
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,500
so therefore we heard on the side of

665
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,960
really rewarding only people where we

666
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,000
know that they definitely did an

667
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,399
excellent job

668
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:07,679
um it's extremely hard for the externals

669
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
because they need a sufficient number of

670
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
reviews of reviews in order to get into

671
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,980
that uh that list therefore there is

672
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,620
only so few but many of them many of

673
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,299
them do an excellent job they just don't

674
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,580
get enough feedback in order to be in

675
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,440
that list for them it's the hardest to

676
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,919
get in there for a regular pc it's hard

677
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,480
because they have to ultimately reject

678
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,059
the papers and for senior PC it's a

679
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,260
little easier but not easy

680
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,299
um because

681
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,100
um

682
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,960
uh they only need to summarize only

683
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,000
right only need to summarize the

684
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,159
opinions of the reviewers

685
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,840
um but these are the people

686
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,659
uh from again

687
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,600
uh uh I don't want to reveal how we

688
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,640
exactly

689
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,980
the math behind this but we are sure

690
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,480
that all of these people did an

691
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,240
excellent job and we want to put that on

692
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,059
the web page and we want to make that

693
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,760
aware and want to give it a nice name so

694
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,320
if you have a suggestion for a nice name

695
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,020
top review or award

696
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:16,320
um uh in pets 20 22 uh then uh

697
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,779
uh this is one way of trying to get

698
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,360
people who do a lot who really put in

699
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,640
the extra effort uh to also get their

700
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,779
recognition

701
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,940
right and I think take it with a grain

702
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,559
of salt if your name is not on here

703
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,720
because

704
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
um we have a question there

705
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,679
um

706
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,220
uh uh because it might just mean that

707
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,919
there was not enough feedback

708
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,140
so this is more of a comment rather than

709
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,220
a question

710
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,340
um I participated in reviewing for iclr

711
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,720
this year so it's like a machine

712
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,039
learning conference

713
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,919
one of the really interesting ideas that

714
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,720
they had which I think May potentially

715
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,520
alleviate some of the problems with you

716
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
know having bad reviewers because

717
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
obviously one solution what the proposed

718
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,100
one was if the reviewers you know seen

719
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,320
as bad just don't invite them again but

720
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,480
at the same time as I said correctly

721
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,880
before this will inevitably put more

722
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,200
pressure on the other reviewers to do

723
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,419
more work so one of the ideas that

724
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:13,740
they've introduced this year which I

725
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,480
think worked brilliantly is they

726
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,640
introduced the so-called Junior reviewer

727
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,100
so what they did they basically paired

728
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,380
up a bunch of people who self-nominate

729
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,779
to review papers people who are not

730
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,399
necessarily very experienced people who

731
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,200
in there like you know Midway through

732
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,240
PhD or started their PHD and you know

733
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,159
they want to try to do good work for

734
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,840
reviewing but they're not necessarily

735
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,179
experienced enough if the review that

736
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,799
they wrote so it was between one and two

737
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,380
papers uh were of good enough quality

738
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,940
that would get integrated into the main

739
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,159
process and then be assigned as you know

740
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,799
proper review rights and I'm just

741
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,659
wondering if one of the potential

742
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,640
solutions to you know not having enough

743
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,740
good reviewers might come from the

744
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,240
similar scheme where you pair up the

745
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,919
people who want to review but not

746
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,380
necessarily aware how to do it properly

747
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,940
with people who are slightly more

748
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,559
experienced and you know kind of

749
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,000
achieving two things at the same time

750
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,460
because you don't put too much pressure

751
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,559
on people who've done it before and you

752
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,720
know just need to review they can

753
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,100
interrupt you right here we do this we

754
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,659
do this okay okay and we do it already

755
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,000
for for a much longer time than iclr

756
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
okay we have this process of externals

757
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,640
for which you can sign up and which we

758
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,100
assign reviews the problem again in my

759
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,019
opinion with the current way of our

760
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,460
externals are done is that there is no

761
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,399
system support and the size that we

762
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,860
currently have uh Michelle can correct

763
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,120
me it gets a little most of the time and

764
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,980
Aaron can also confirm that I think most

765
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,940
of the time the PC chair spend is uh on

766
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,159
making sure external assignments are

767
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,140
valid and I spend very many weekends

768
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,519
reviewing this for the last two years of

769
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,799
pets okay cool I didn't realize that was

770
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,760
a thing but yeah

771
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,080
all right

772
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,360
so

773
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,019
um

774
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,360
the next thing is a self-publishing

775
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,200
process so pets will no longer publish

776
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,960
with the greater cyano

777
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,340
um on their Open Access platform

778
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,679
starting volume three of this year

779
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,840
but we'll move all of its uh already

780
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,559
published and future

781
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,840
papers onto its own website uh like the

782
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,620
Journal of machine learning research

783
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,000
um and

784
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,200
um publish it by itself the reason was

785
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,080
twofold won a price increase by dig

786
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,779
reuter and another one of unclear

787
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,500
contractual Clauses that would have put

788
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,960
the organization into some

789
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,740
uh unclear situation

790
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,519
um and uh we decided to try to keep the

791
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,100
process with the templates the latex

792
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,019
templates and all these things as much

793
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,600
for 2022 Michelle is going to talk later

794
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,418
a little bit about 2023 I think we're

795
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,839
still working on the indexing with

796
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:13,440
um

797
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,699
uh uh uh

798
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,639
DOI document object identifier dplp

799
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,918
scholar Google Scholar and others that

800
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,159
they pick up on us and I really Michelle

801
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,320
mentioned it during uh the opening

802
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,599
remarks really really a big thank you to

803
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,540
to Matt Wright and Ian Goldberg who have

804
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,739
taken on out of nothing this huge task

805
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,540
of getting this platform and the

806
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,480
self-publishing process off the ground

807
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,940
and uh work with our with us as the PC

808
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,159
chairs work with our publication chairs

809
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,239
which also

810
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,418
put in tremendous hours

811
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:52,918
and try to get this process off the

812
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,560
ground which is no simple feat yes yes

813
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,300
please

814
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,020
[Applause]

815
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,560
so uh I'm wondering uh are there any

816
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
questions on this self-publishing

817
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,040
process I mean we're all computer

818
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,640
scientists I think the times of uh

819
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,799
printed books are a little bit over

820
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,480
okay

821
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,420
all right the next slide is uh for

822
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,660
Michelle

823
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,400
if she's yes

824
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,060
yes my lights are even back so uh good

825
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,260
timing okay

826
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,579
um yeah so uh so we also this year

827
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,180
um uh introduced a slightly more robust

828
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,980
ethics process

829
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,020
um so the goal of our process here is to

830
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,800
make sure that any uh ethics issues that

831
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,300
come up in papers and here I'm not

832
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,160
really talking about like

833
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,619
uh you know plagiarism or something

834
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,599
although that comes up as well but I'm

835
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,220
talking more about uh if people have

836
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,740
concerned about the uh whether or not

837
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,440
the ethics of the research that was

838
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,660
conducted in our paper are acceptable in

839
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,220
terms of for example treatment of human

840
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,579
subjects or uh responsible disclosure of

841
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,740
some kind of vulnerability uh what we

842
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,180
want to do with this process is just

843
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,960
make sure that any concerns get flagged

844
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,000
and get thoroughly discussed we're

845
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
probably not ever going to you know

846
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,200
reach 100 agreement on all of these

847
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,940
cases but what we don't want to have

848
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,780
happen

849
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,700
um which has you know somewhat notably

850
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,560
happened

851
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,500
in other situations is for um a concern

852
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,660
to be raised you know somewhere in the

853
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,339
fifth paragraph of a review and then

854
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,619
nobody notices it was there and then the

855
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,140
yeah the entire issue sort of drops on

856
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,640
the floor and stops

857
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,460
so in order to avoid this

858
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,099
one thing that we did was we added a

859
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,800
review field so every view that our

860
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,560
reviewer completes now they need to let

861
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,440
us know whether they have no concern

862
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,900
about ethical issues uh and then if they

863
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,339
do have a concern we sort of have this

864
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,980
split into two categories one is there's

865
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,720
a concern but it's primarily that

866
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,720
something was not specified so they

867
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
didn't put in how much they paid there

868
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
to participants so we can't judge

869
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,500
whether it was a fair compensation right

870
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,260
uh and then a slightly stronger category

871
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,220
of

872
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,140
an explosive concern not just that

873
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,579
information is missing but that

874
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,099
something that was discussed in the

875
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,619
paper uh tropes and ethics like of some

876
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,660
kind uh and we asked to reviewers to

877
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,780
explain why for 2022 these fields were

878
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,359
hidden from the authors in order to

879
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,300
allow their viewers to you know speak

880
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,460
more freely but what we'd find was that

881
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,680
that resulted in sometimes authors not

882
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,800
realizing uh if they're if the concerns

883
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,540
were like not repeated in the author

884
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,700
visible Fields not realizing what the

885
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,500
concern was so this is for this year we

886
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,480
decided to make it more directly visible

887
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,000
to the authors so they'll be able to

888
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,380
respond to these during their rebuttal

889
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,220
phase

890
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,720
and

891
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,540
and then if these concerns uh so there's

892
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,200
no uh so if any of these concerns

893
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,780
were not you know resolved quickly so

894
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,180
for example they just supplied the

895
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,619
missing information in the rebuttal and

896
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,960
it was fine great uh but if we had any

897
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,700
stronger concerns or things that

898
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,980
couldn't be immediately resolved we

899
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,200
assigned one or more

900
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,240
additional ethics reviewers from a

901
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,859
volunteer committee which was drawn

902
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,420
primarily from

903
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,180
the PC itself and occasionally from

904
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,460
experts and we asked them to take

905
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,619
another review specifically focusing on

906
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,000
ethics and then we discussed the problem

907
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,859
with the among the reviewers the senior

908
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,339
PC member and the chairs until we uh

909
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,760
until we reached a conclusion and in

910
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,400
2022 we did not have any problems that

911
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,460
were so serious as to Merit rejecting a

912
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,700
paper on an Ethics basis

913
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,339
[Music]

914
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,060
um

915
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,839
uh so we did we were able to uh obtain

916
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,119
well right so in some cases papers were

917
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,619
you know already not being accepted and

918
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,560
in other cases we were able to obtain

919
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,859
enough information to resolve the issue

920
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,800
do you want to go to the next one

921
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,140
uh so just as an example for Issue

922
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,960
Number Four uh we had 22 papers that

923
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,240
received at least one ethics flag from

924
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,200
some reviewer uh most of these the vast

925
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,579
majority of the faces of this was true

926
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,780
in all the issues were missing

927
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,300
information about human subjects

928
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,760
research in terms of how people were

929
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,740
recruited how they were compensated how

930
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,500
their data was kept confidential and

931
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,820
there were the second most popular

932
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,579
although seem to be only less frequent

933
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,460
was issues around

934
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,300
disclosure of some kind of

935
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,720
vulnerabilities of those 22 four

936
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,700
received the more serious flag

937
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,780
[Music]

938
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,599
which was not just missing information

939
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,040
two of these were related to disclosure

940
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,200
to relate to human subjects

941
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,160
um

942
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,040
and two of those papers did end up being

943
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,320
accepted uh after

944
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,060
um longer discussions with the authors

945
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,940
and in some cases uh for example uh

946
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,140
asking the authors during the

947
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,000
shepherding process to do extra

948
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,680
disclosure work

949
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,480
would considered to be sufficient to

950
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,319
resolve the concerns so um I felt like

951
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,960
the process you know obviously right if

952
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,240
we missed it false negatives are hard to

953
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,740
hard to find right so if we missed

954
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,880
something I guess I'll find out pretty

955
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,859
soon now that all the papers are public

956
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,619
but as far as I know so far I think the

957
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,339
process worked fairly well in terms of

958
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:34,680
uh resulting in lots of discussion about

959
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,380
these issues and resulting in many

960
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,380
papers for revised version that's

961
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,000
putting in a lot more detail about how

962
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,280
they handled ethical questions which is

963
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,720
I think great for the community because

964
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,960
it disseminates knowledge of how to do

965
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,640
these things and allows us to judge the

966
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,619
research more effectively

967
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,300
questions comments about this stuff

968
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,579
thank you

969
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,680
sorry I stepped out for a minute so you

970
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,240
may have addressed this before I walked

971
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,300
in but is there an ethical framework

972
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,780
upon which you're making judgment I'm

973
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,700
really suspicious of people claiming to

974
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,040
do ethics without talking about either

975
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,520
like a deontological set of rules or is

976
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,280
it like consequentialism or like so what

977
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,180
are you bathing an Ethics problem on

978
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,339
uh I think

979
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,940
um to the uh I think we're we're basing

980
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,760
this primarily on things like the memo

981
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,720
report

982
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,200
um and um uh other similar principles so

983
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,560
things around minimizing harm

984
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,359
um not not eliminating harm but

985
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,119
minimizing harm and considering sort of

986
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,339
the

987
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,819
trade-offs between benefits

988
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:56,520
and potential harms of the research as

989
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,280
well as considering you know what other

990
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,960
options board would have been available

991
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,780
to the researchers and the decision they

992
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,020
made

993
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,760
are there any other questions for

994
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
Michelle

995
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,300
all right thanks Michelle we're going to

996
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,560
move on now I'm going to talk a bit

997
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,359
about the artifact committee from this

998
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,740
year

999
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,240
um for those who don't know three years

1000
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,480
ago pets introduced the artifact review

1001
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,900
process so papers accepted to pets would

1002
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,000
then receive an invitation to submit an

1003
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,079
artifact associated with their paper and

1004
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,599
since then this has continued to grow

1005
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,819
and new issues keep coming up or new

1006
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,099
bonuses and I'm going to talk about

1007
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,020
those in a bit but first I'm going to

1008
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,460
show you the numbers so you have a bit

1009
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,640
of an idea on the scale and impact these

1010
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,520
issues had in terms of the quantity

1011
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,640
so this year we had 51 artifacts

1012
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,500
submitted in total when you compare that

1013
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,400
to 500 papers submitted that's uh much

1014
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,460
less in coming for us

1015
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,800
only it's only for accepted papers that

1016
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,720
that can submit an artifact

1017
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,040
um

1018
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,700
and so out of 128 we have 51 that

1019
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,520
submitted artifacts which is pretty good

1020
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,460
and a continuing increase because the

1021
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,460
previous year we had 34 submissions to

1022
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,319
the artifact review

1023
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,140
uh so far we have 36 artifacts that have

1024
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,180
been accepted and those are every single

1025
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,740
artifact that was submitted in either

1026
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,500
rounds one two or three has been

1027
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,380
accepted and uh there's 15 still being

1028
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,579
reviewed uh from round four and that's

1029
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,500
just kind of a timeline thing and we'll

1030
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,560
talk about that in a bit more similar to

1031
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,660
pets we have different numbers of

1032
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,839
submissions for each issue we continue

1033
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,359
to see a drop in issue two for the

1034
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,819
number of submissions maybe people just

1035
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:59,579
publish more theorems in issue two I

1036
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:00,980
don't know

1037
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,900
and a large increase in the number of

1038
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,240
artifacts in Issue four with the most

1039
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,160
out of all of the issues

1040
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,960
so for artifact review this year we had

1041
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,599
an artifact Committee of 24 reviewers

1042
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,220
which at the start of the year we

1043
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,200
thought was great we were almost doubled

1044
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,579
from last year

1045
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,920
and each artifact was assigned to

1046
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,680
reviews and reviewers received at most

1047
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,720
three artifacts per round which is up

1048
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,339
from the previous year where we would

1049
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:32,160
receive at most two but we simply just

1050
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,619
had too many artifacts

1051
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,140
artifact review is single blind so the

1052
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,000
reviewers are Anonymous but because the

1053
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,859
papers are already accepted we kind of

1054
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,140
know whose they are so it's not possible

1055
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,079
to be double-blind and artifacts consist

1056
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,180
of scripts source code and data sets

1057
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,460
though primarily it's scripts and source

1058
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,859
code and frequently include either a VM

1059
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,720
or a Docker image

1060
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,079
this year we had some artifacts that had

1061
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,819
some major Hardware requirements and

1062
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,859
this limited reproducibility so this

1063
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,780
included things related to Raspberry

1064
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,500
Pi's or webcams as well as iPhones and

1065
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,000
in one case the Satellite Dish I think

1066
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,099
One reviewer said

1067
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,079
um so this has introduced some new

1068
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,940
things to consider going into this next

1069
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,819
year for artifact review one was

1070
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,859
considering introducing artifacts

1071
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,260
available versus artifacts verified or

1072
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,640
reproducible

1073
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,400
and then the other possibility being to

1074
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,619
pool for external reviewers for

1075
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,800
artifacts specifically when we need this

1076
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,819
specialized Hardware

1077
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,839
and one of the ways we thought that this

1078
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,700
might be possible is if we reached out

1079
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,359
to the regular pets committee and saw

1080
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,940
who had this Hardware already as part of

1081
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,800
their

1082
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,440
their own research a lot of the

1083
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,540
reviewers on the artifact committee are

1084
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,339
more Junior researchers and don't

1085
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,800
necessarily have Hardware especially if

1086
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,300
it's not for their own research it's not

1087
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,920
in the budget to just kind of acquire

1088
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,880
for a one-off review

1089
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,480
here's the fun bun

1090
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,540
so artifact review and timelines

1091
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,400
previously the main goal with artifact

1092
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,960
review is to just kind of continue to

1093
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,520
improve reproducibility and

1094
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,160
accessibility of research coming out of

1095
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,900
the pets community

1096
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,619
but this year artifact review was able

1097
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,540
and did find some issues with some

1098
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,300
papers so whether it was a mistake in

1099
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,859
something that was set up in the paper

1100
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,780
or that we found in the artifact that

1101
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,400
affected the results or how they

1102
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,859
reported it

1103
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:36,780
it was identified which is great because

1104
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,640
now the authors had the opportunity to

1105
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,800
address these issues and in each case

1106
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,500
they did so but infrastructure was

1107
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,200
incredibly strained and uh I'm very very

1108
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,359
sorry publication chairs we did not

1109
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,700
predict this but you can see the

1110
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,500
timeline on the bottom there papers get

1111
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,780
accepted at that point you get an

1112
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,420
invitation to submit an artifact the

1113
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,400
artifact deadline is the same deadline

1114
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,319
as the camera ready

1115
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,560
you know the final version

1116
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,960
and then weeks later because we've got

1117
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,119
to give people time to review we'll now

1118
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,720
be aware of these potential issues so at

1119
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,000
least two weeks after the final version

1120
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,700
of the paper we are finding a problem

1121
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,160
that now we have to see how the authors

1122
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,520
are going to address it and then how are

1123
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,160
we going to fit it into the remaining

1124
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,160
publication process fortunately

1125
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,460
none of these were found in round four

1126
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,319
or we would have been doomed but it's

1127
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,760
still something that we need to consider

1128
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,619
going forward in terms of changing the

1129
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:39,300
timelines and how we want artifact

1130
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,460
review to work in cooperation with pets

1131
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,880
publication

1132
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:47,160
any questions about our fact review or

1133
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,160
on potential paths for this

1134
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,540
new development that we've had

1135
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,440
um well I was just wondering uh if there

1136
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,300
was a reason for placing the artifact

1137
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,579
that line so late

1138
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,099
because I it was kind of expected that

1139
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,760
you would end up with results after the

1140
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,859
uh after the papers were final

1141
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,140
so artifact review is in part only for

1142
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,859
accepted papers and part of that is

1143
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,660
doing a thorough like artifact review

1144
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,160
already takes a lot of time because

1145
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,960
you're going through all the code and

1146
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,599
documentation that someone submitted so

1147
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,520
to do it before the paper has been

1148
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,099
accepted means we're now looking at that

1149
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,920
pool of 500 papers potentially rather

1150
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,380
than a 120 Max

1151
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,280
um no but if I'm looking at your slide

1152
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,760
you see paper accepted then at fat call

1153
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,500
and then

1154
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,540
camera already and outfit that line I'm

1155
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,040
not sure if this dude were the same

1156
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,140
because we we submitted an artist I was

1157
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,339
not sure they were saying but uh

1158
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:00,960
uh at least I would have done like

1159
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,359
artifact code paper up selected together

1160
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,760
with the artificial deadline like as

1161
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,440
soon as you you can start preparing the

1162
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,800
artifact I mean most likely if you have

1163
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,440
a paper that you're confident will be

1164
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,440
accepted or that you hope will be

1165
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,900
accepted you will have an artifact

1166
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,200
and then if the paper is accepted you

1167
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,280
submit it like a few days later

1168
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,800
and that will help you provide reviews

1169
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,880
more quickly and

1170
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:34,859
artifacts of affiliated with their

1171
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:35,760
papers

1172
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,579
but there's a difference between in many

1173
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,940
cases perhaps the final product that was

1174
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,040
sufficient to make your results for you

1175
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,839
and having them be in any way

1176
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,880
reproducible or accessible to a

1177
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,619
different person on a different

1178
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,099
infrastructure so I it's more of an

1179
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,480
awareness that there's this additional

1180
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,880
time that authors may need while I would

1181
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,579
love to thank all authors have the time

1182
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,400
and are willing to put it into no but I

1183
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,559
think for example on taking our example

1184
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,500
because we did have an artifact but now

1185
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,420
I don't remember exactly when we learned

1186
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,940
about the artifact but it was very very

1187
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,359
late and certainly

1188
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,700
uh very close to

1189
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,460
um we did not know about the octaphar

1190
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,619
when we submitted a paper

1191
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:26,059
and had we known that it's

1192
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:30,119
not uh we and had we known that if we

1193
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,160
wanted to submit an artifact

1194
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,040
it we would have had to do like three

1195
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,160
days after the acceptance of the paper

1196
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,079
then we would have prepared the artifact

1197
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,500
earlier

1198
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,099
yeah as Florian said the call for

1199
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,640
artifacts is on the Pet's web page

1200
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,040
um it's not like when you submit your

1201
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,859
paper and hot crap but on the call for

1202
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,319
papers lower on there is also the call

1203
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,079
for artifacts you just get an invitation

1204
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:03,000
to submit after your paper has been

1205
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,400
accepted

1206
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,740
but the call is there

1207
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,160
is a question

1208
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,680
I have a question

1209
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,000
uh so who first uh Ian go ahead I guess

1210
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,140
and then we'll we have one in person

1211
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,180
sure thanks so

1212
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,079
um I want to note that CCS this year

1213
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:39,119
made a change where you submit your

1214
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,359
artifact at the same time as you submit

1215
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,900
your paper now

1216
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,859
I don't want uh Bailey and the team to

1217
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,440
review those artifacts before the paper

1218
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,260
is accepted but if the artifact is

1219
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,800
sitting there in or a link to it in hot

1220
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,740
crap or something then the moment the

1221
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,940
paper is accepted the team can start

1222
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,140
reviewing the accepted papers artifacts

1223
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,619
the downside of that is that it takes a

1224
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:16,859
little bit extra annoying work to submit

1225
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,559
an anonymized artifact

1226
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:22,319
which but I mean we had to do that for

1227
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:27,420
ccs and it's not impossible

1228
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,240
if we just require the authors to submit

1229
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,880
an anonymized artifact at submission

1230
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,440
time then we can save this

1231
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,319
uh a couple of weeks

1232
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,300
um in the timeline here

1233
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,819
I wonder

1234
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:47,339
if it was held to

1235
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:48,900
um

1236
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,520
like what if we

1237
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,440
made the artifact submission happen

1238
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,420
sometime

1239
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,339
after rebuttals but before final

1240
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,460
decisions come out yeah because then if

1241
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,319
you if you don't think your paper has a

1242
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:03,839
shot yeah

1243
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:04,559
yeah

1244
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,780
um also it like like you mentioned

1245
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,480
things are a little hectic at the paper

1246
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,119
deadline often anyway uh many of us

1247
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,099
maybe wish we were better about that but

1248
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:14,760
um

1249
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,000
it just sort of and as Roger mentioned

1250
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,819
like the artifact cleanup and the camera

1251
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:22,319
already happening at the same having

1252
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,819
multiple things happening at one time

1253
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:25,559
makes things hard yeah I don't know if

1254
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:27,680
there's enough time in between the

1255
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,180
rebuttals and the um

1256
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,859
and the notifications for that to work

1257
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,380
no that's a great idea if you make the

1258
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,559
artifact deadline like even a day or two

1259
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,980
after the paper acceptance

1260
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,180
then anyone who gets a interim reviews

1261
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,520
that look promising they can are getting

1262
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,680
their artifact together and then just

1263
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,619
push the button when it gets accepted

1264
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:55,260
yeah and I think that I mean even if you

1265
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,319
had it if it had to do like around right

1266
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,020
after the rebuttal period like you

1267
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,700
wouldn't have to necessarily anonymize

1268
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,020
it if no one's gonna look at it until

1269
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,020
after it's accepted anyway

1270
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,660
right right exactly no so that's a

1271
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,579
better idea than what I said for sure

1272
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:14,220
yeah that solves both problems just make

1273
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,800
the artifact deadline the day after the

1274
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,099
paper acceptance notification but make

1275
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,960
no other changes but everyone needs

1276
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,300
obviously to be aware this is

1277
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,180
this is happening one trick is that so

1278
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,559
we got hit by this in uh usenic security

1279
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,780
um a little while ago

1280
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,859
um for Shepherd or shepherded or major

1281
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,260
river not major revision so in Pat's

1282
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,319
case it would be for shepherded papers

1283
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:45,420
um it turned out the artifact that line

1284
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,880
was before the shepherding deadline so

1285
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,680
you didn't actually know that your paper

1286
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,040
was accepted until after the artifact

1287
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,680
deadline and that actually surprised and

1288
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,559
bit us but they allowed us to submit the

1289
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,720
artifact next artifact deadline

1290
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:06,119
uh so something

1291
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,359
I think we still have uh Florian still

1292
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,559
has some more slides here though I don't

1293
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,240
know who has to present them and we're

1294
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,859
we're coming near the end of the time so

1295
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:17,900
I think we need to move on

1296
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,980
I actually had some things that I wanted

1297
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,119
to ask

1298
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
like

1299
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,619
um please when we started the artifact

1300
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,960
originally made an assumption about what

1301
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,299
time and I think it would be reasonable

1302
00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:36,480
to use at that timeline now

1303
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,400
um I'll also say that a lot of the

1304
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,680
artifacts require several back and forth

1305
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,099
rounds so if people have artifacts that

1306
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,280
they don't think are ready quite yet

1307
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,099
it's probably fine for them to knit them

1308
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:52,980
as long as they are continuing to work

1309
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,780
on them in the background and that

1310
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,099
actually

1311
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,660
works really well with how the artifact

1312
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,359
workflow usually goes so I mean I've

1313
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:02,460
seen a couple people make comments here

1314
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,680
in the online space saying that they

1315
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,359
feel like their artifact is quite ready

1316
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:10,160
that might actually be okay

1317
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,839
that's all I wanted to say

1318
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,720
so everyone should know that Cecilia was

1319
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,099
the one who actually introduced the

1320
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,500
artifact process so so she's responsible

1321
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,819
for all the problems we're having right

1322
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:26,000
now

1323
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:29,280
but I think we are all we are all all

1324
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,140
very grateful uh Michelle I think this

1325
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,020
is your slide I hope the power is on

1326
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,819
uh and uh uh

1327
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,520
yeah so

1328
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,299
I'm says we're new in 2022 uh I think

1329
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,760
Woods is more of a adjusting to some of

1330
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,220
the things that were new in 202. um so

1331
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,319
one big thing is that we did switch

1332
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:58,140
um from the standard template to the ACN

1333
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,599
template which we hope is going to make

1334
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:03,480
life easier for everybody

1335
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,079
um

1336
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,200
now that we are self-published and we're

1337
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,180
still working out some additional

1338
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,619
adjustments to the self-publishing

1339
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,740
process so we should hopefully have a

1340
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,240
new licensing agreement with a new and

1341
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,859
uh less restrictive Creative Commons

1342
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,540
license that should be ready pretty soon

1343
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,640
uh we are also

1344
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,680
discussing how to

1345
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,420
take advantage of the self-publishing

1346
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,059
process to try to make life somewhat

1347
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,059
less painful for our publication chairs

1348
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:35,000
who have to do a lot of work sort of

1349
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,920
reformatting everybody's papers and

1350
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,079
rebuilding the law Tech which is

1351
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,140
terrible so uh we're we're sort of

1352
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,940
experimenting a little bit with that I

1353
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,960
don't think we're going to nail that

1354
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,819
process on the first track but we will

1355
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:50,280
uh being self being independent allows

1356
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,960
us to continue experimenting with that a

1357
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,359
little bit uh and just continuing to

1358
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,760
evolve things we talked about

1359
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,480
um

1360
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,380
uh already today the ethics process the

1361
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,900
senior PC I hope based on our experience

1362
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,380
last year we were able to give clear

1363
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,599
instructions and a better sense of the

1364
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,260
scope of the senior job to our senior PC

1365
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,440
members this time around and also

1366
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,780
continuing to think about like

1367
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,319
uh the review feedback process and how

1368
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,540
we're going to continue to handle those

1369
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,000
kinds of things so I think nothing uh

1370
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,059
dramatically new but hoping to iterate

1371
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:32,059
um

1372
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,200
all right thank you Michelle uh we are

1373
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,640
actually done we're actually a little

1374
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,400
bit over time uh but I want to open it

1375
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,839
for open questions from the floor

1376
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:44,040
because this is supposed to be

1377
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,500
interactive if there's anything that has

1378
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,059
not been covered that you want to raise

1379
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:50,819
your opportunity is now or later on the

1380
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,180
coffee break

1381
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,660
if not uh yeah there is one okay

1382
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,339
yeah so we talked almost entirely about

1383
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,040
the conference proceeding side of things

1384
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,020
but there's also the the actual

1385
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,260
in-person or virtual uh hybrid thing so

1386
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,720
if you have opinions on uh being here in

1387
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,359
person or if you the Cyber people have

1388
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,059
opinions on being there not in person uh

1389
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,619
please let us know it'd be great to have

1390
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:21,599
a town hall about exactly that I mean

1391
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,980
one of the things I was thinking some

1392
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,500
days ago in the workshop model it used

1393
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,020
to be that you look at who's attending

1394
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,520
the conference and you pull your

1395
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,339
speakers from that and uh the workshops

1396
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,020
this year didn't at all work that way

1397
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,599
and there are trade-offs but we're out

1398
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,859
of time so I'll hand it back to Florian

1399
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,000
thank you that is indeed the big open

1400
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,900
question is uh hybrid or in person and

1401
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,940
what what all your experiences are here

1402
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,720
so let anyone like Bali or anyone else

1403
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,819
on the pet board know and hopefully we

1404
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,619
can do something about this other than

1405
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,599
that I want to say thank you

1406
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,859
and enjoy the coffee break
