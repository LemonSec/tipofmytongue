1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,840
hi everyone my name is max zinkus and i

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,799
will be presenting our paper uh sok

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,960
cryptographic confidentiality of data on

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,559
mobile devices

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
i worked on this with my co-authors

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
tushar joyce and my advisor dr matthew

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,960
green at johns hopkins university in

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,680
baltimore maryland

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
so that name is quite a mouthful

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
what i really want to talk about in this

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
talk in short is defending mobile

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640
privacy

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
so we've all seen ads like these

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,440
as this one's a classic um privacy

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,399
that's iphone but we've also seen

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,800
articles such as these

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,640
access to for example iphones in this

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,520
case

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,399
um

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
and this sort of creates a clear uh

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
contradiction um you know somebody's

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,960
somebody's got to be wrong here right

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,760
so

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,199
how do we go about

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,680
exploring and resolving this conundrum

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,800
and i hope the answer jumping to

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
everyone's mind is the same as ours

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
which is by analyzing the entire history

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,359
of ios and android security features

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
bypasses to those security features and

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
forensic data extraction tools which

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
existed

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
so what do we mean by the entire history

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
we mean ios and android security guides

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,159
which do deep dives into the security

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,479
features of these devices

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,240
we also mean

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
the us department of homeland security

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,479
forensic tool evaluations

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,360
effectively these are analyses of which

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
forensic tools exist

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,680
uh how they work what they're able to

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
extract from from the major platforms

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
ios and android um

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
and uh you know these are

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,040
executed per a nist standard

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
um

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,200
in a very uh sort of thorough way

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
as well as a few 100 other sources which

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
span research papers news articles

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
warrant documentation

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
uh blog posts and

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
many others and hardware tear downs

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,810
critically as well

55
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,119
[Music]

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
so we looked at this history and and

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
what was sort of our our product of all

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,880
of this uh analysis

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,920
so we ended up writing uh about 111

60
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,520
111-page report which uh hopefully

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
everyone's relief i will not be

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
summarizing here

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
what did it contain from from a high

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
level

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
we have an analyze history of security

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
features in both ios and android

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,239
and uh in the sok version of the paper

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,920
which we actually submitted to pets we

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,640
look at the research papers which have

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
led and followed this development

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,000
as well as their sort of impacts and

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,640
implementations within the platforms

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
we looked at known bypass techniques to

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,760
these uh security mechanisms

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
both in ios and android sort of

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
connecting themes between all of them

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
whether from a technical or

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
other contextual perspective

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
and we looked at how these bypass

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
techniques were realized into extraction

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,959
tools

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
you know here's an example of a set of

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,599
tools which were analyzed by the dhs

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,959
and we

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
dig into all of these reports to

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
really break down what data was

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
accessible when and how

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
we aggregated all this information and

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,280
provided some proposed improvements

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
across the two platforms that we

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
analyzed

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
and in the larger report these really

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
are from a technical perspective maybe a

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,519
development perspective

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
in the sok version we really look at

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
research directions which can go beyond

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
the current state of the art and improve

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
and address some of these issues

99
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
now there's an important aside i'd like

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
to make which is comparing illicit and

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
lawful access to data sort of both of

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
which we consider unauthorized but are

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
obviously on very different sides of a

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
legal analysis

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
now

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
what i'm showing you here is a set of

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,360
comparisons that we make between roughly

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,640
equivalent

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,280
methods of accessing data on devices

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
one lawful and the other illicit

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
and as you can see these these

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,319
connecting these sort of connected

113
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
techniques either rely on the same

114
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,799
underlying technology or are otherwise

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,959
somewhat indistinguishable to the end

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,080
device

117
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,439
you know how is it going to determine

118
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
whether to allow or disallow access to

119
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
something or how is a security feature

120
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
supposed to be designed for one but not

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
the other and we dig into this disparity

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
a little further in our in our paper

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
but you know in summary we're sort of

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
going to be considering unauthorized

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
access from the perspective of

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,919
uh

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
what data can be extracted after the

128
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
compromise device and not necessarily so

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
much you know whether it's a

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,400
lawful access technique or an illicit

131
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
access technique

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
so what were the summary of our findings

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,479
something that might not be too

134
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
surprising for this audience is that as

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
we rely on the cloud more to store

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,320
personal data

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,720
we so too do we increase the propensity

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
of leaks from that cloud data

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
now often data is stored in the cloud

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
using provider-controlled encryption

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
keys not necessarily user controlled

142
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
in fact even in the case of for example

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
imessage which is sort of famously end

144
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
and encrypted now

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
we see an example of

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
apple sort of subverting that end in

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
encryption if you also have icloud

148
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
backup enabled for imessage where they

149
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
actually back up that end end encryption

150
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,720
key uh into your backup which is

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
encrypted by apple uh in case you need

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
to you know resolve restore all of those

153
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
imessages having you know broken all of

154
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
your your trusted devices

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,880
um

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
which was a bit surprising to us at the

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,520
time

158
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,199
we also see the application of strong

159
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
cryptography throughout these devices

160
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
across ios and android um but we also

161
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
unfortunately see

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,120
again subversions or or lack of coverage

163
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
of the strong cryptography over over

164
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
user data

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
especially in tiered situations of

166
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,800
access for example uh when a device is

167
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
before first unlock say it's powered off

168
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
that level of protection as compared to

169
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
a device that is after first unlocked

170
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
first time it's been booted up and

171
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
unlocked

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
even if it's at the time locked

173
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
uh those two sets of data in uh are

174
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
which are encrypted are very different

175
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,680
and you know realistically how often do

176
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
we carry our phones powered off and not

177
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,840
first unlocked

178
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,039
um

179
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,120
and then finally we see you know in

180
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,639
response to the secure hardware that's

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
been deployed we see advanced exploits

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,720
you know for example i have a great

183
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
device pictured here which is known to

184
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,919
extract

185
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
data and be able to reforce passcodes on

186
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
ios devices

187
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,039
despite the secure hardware that was

188
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,160
meant to prevent those attacks

189
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
so what were the key themes

190
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
we see you know this history of

191
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,000
extensive access to personal personal

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
data unfortunately and you know this

193
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,840
kind of cat and mouse way

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
uh of security features and and bypasses

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
which really leaves the end user in a

196
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,479
situation where

197
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
at any given time they're not sure how

198
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
much privacy they have

199
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
and we do actually also see law

200
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
enforcement agencies using their seat at

201
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
the table using their access to you know

202
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
say judiciary or or legislative actors

203
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
to push for increased access

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
i've pictured james comey here

205
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,759
from the famous sort of going dark

206
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
testimony

207
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,319
wherein the fbi argue

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
that they are having decreased access to

209
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
data because of encryption because of

210
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
increasing encryption

211
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,800
um which we know to not be the case we

212
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
know that the fbi now has

213
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
more access to data than they ever have

214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
before

215
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
in some cases too much that they haven't

216
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
actually been able to thoroughly analyze

217
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
all of it

218
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
and so

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,840
you know that's sort of the more bleak

220
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
side of things we do also see some

221
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,840
positive signs we see providers being

222
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
proactive you know when i say providers

223
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,280
apple and google

224
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
um

225
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
we see secure hardware being deployed in

226
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
devices we see increasing user control

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,039
encryption

228
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,800
and we also see this emerging paradigm

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,319
of secure hardware actually being used

230
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,599
in the cloud

231
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,840
which was one of the more key takeaways

232
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
uh which is that we have this

233
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
industry-led trend of trusted hardware

234
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
being deployed in the cloud like

235
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
hardware security modules such as the

236
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,800
titan hsm

237
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
those used in icloud's key vault

238
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
or sort of the simulated hsm of intel

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,479
sgx which is used in a signal's secure

240
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,639
value recovery system also sort of a

241
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,080
backup service

242
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
a cloud backup service

243
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
for the encrypted messenger

244
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
so we see this industry-led trend

245
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
uh emerging and

246
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
providers sort of

247
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
moderating their own access to user data

248
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
now this really clearly targets that you

249
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
know malicious server compromise server

250
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,399
or malicious insider or even potentially

251
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,479
subpoena threat models

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,039
closing out access and really enforcing

253
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
user controlled encryption in these

254
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,039
cases

255
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
and then from a research perspective we

256
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
see emerging tools such as say burn box

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
or other plausible deniable encryption

258
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
schemes for mobile devices and as well

259
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
as an interesting project from google

260
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
for example we see the trillion project

261
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
trying to bring certificate transparency

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,800
type transparency logs to uh to the open

263
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
source community

264
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
some particularly interesting works in

265
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
this space recently have also included

266
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
how to protect cryptographic systems

267
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
from compelled decryption

268
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,399
um

269
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
uh scheffler at all at usenix um

270
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,920
and then also how we can ensure that

271
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
warrants are enforced in a in a correct

272
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
way using cryptography rather than just

273
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
sort of the discretion of an analyst

274
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
um at eurocrypt last year as well and

275
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
i'm happy to share these links later

276
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
so we do see emerging research trying to

277
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,399
address these challenges um although not

278
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
in a uh

279
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,200
in a complete way

280
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,399
and that's one of the things that we

281
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,000
really wanted to have

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
people take away from this especially

283
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
from a research perspective was

284
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
you know as we develop cryptographic

285
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
systems for mobile devices you know

286
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,720
let's really integrate the positive

287
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
aspects of cloud and

288
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
and secure hardware services and

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
offerings into those cryptographic

290
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
systems and then also let's take into

291
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
account the cloud when we're developing

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,839
these systems you know if we're storing

293
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
a sensitive secret is that going to be

294
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
backed up to the cloud

295
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,040
what does it actually mean for our

296
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
protocol for that to be uh disclosed

297
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,040
down the line

298
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
from a developer perspective as well

299
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
let's continue to deploy these

300
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,079
techniques there's been some amazing

301
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,120
work both

302
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
across ios and android um and seeing

303
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,480
that continue and putting these actual

304
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
cryptographic tools in the hands of of

305
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
people

306
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
is is really

307
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
vital work

308
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,399
um and then to legislators uh you know

309
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,079
we've seen the crypto wars come and go

310
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,079
multiple times um

311
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,720
let's consider not rebooting it again

312
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,680
um

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
and from the from the advocates and

314
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
researchers perspective let's continue

315
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,480
to push

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
uh back against

317
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
these types of sweeping changes and

318
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,720
sweeping limitations to to user privacy

319
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
so thank you all so much for your time

320
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,279
i would love to field any questions that

321
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
people have and then this is a link to a

322
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
website that we made

323
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
to sort of summarize the results

324
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
especially of the larger report

325
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,519
um which might be a bit unwieldy to read

326
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,720
through and through

327
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
so you can scan the qr code if you like

328
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
there's also the url in maps too

329
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,160
thanks so much again and yeah
