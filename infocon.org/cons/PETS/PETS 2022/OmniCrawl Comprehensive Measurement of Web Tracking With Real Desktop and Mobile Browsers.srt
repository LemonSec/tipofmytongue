1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone my name is darian castle

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,919
and today i'm going to be talking to you

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,440
about omnicrawl comprehensive

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,879
measurement of web tracking with real

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,800
desktop and mobile browsers this is

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,240
joint work between myself and my

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,719
colleagues at several institutions

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,920
again i'm going to talk about the

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,599
concept of browser fingerprinting in

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
particular as it applies to mobile

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,480
browsers

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
so modern mobile phones and desktop

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
computers have a complex configuration

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,439
of both hardware and software

15
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,640
if you think about a phone that you may

16
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,720
have you may have a camera a microphone

17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
a gyroscope an accelerometer a gps

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,279
module these particular hardware

19
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,558
components make up the hardware

20
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,160
characteristics of advice

21
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,760
likewise devices also have a suite of

22
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,440
software characteristics such as the

23
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
operating system the device is running

24
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
the browser that a user is using as well

25
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,399
as its configuration a particular

26
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
version as well as things that people

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
don't think about as often such as which

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,879
fonts are installed on the device

29
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,399
browser fingerprinting is what occurs

30
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
when a tracker is able to gather enough

31
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,280
of these hardware and software

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
characteristics to be able to uniquely

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,440
identify a user's browser across website

34
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
visits

35
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,600
with that in mind we'll now look at the

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
rise of mobile browsing which is the

37
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,159
second piece of motivation for our work

38
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,159
what we saw over the past decade is a

39
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,080
steady increase in the market share

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
mobile browsing relative to desktop

41
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
browsing culminating in 2016 where we

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
see that mobile browsing actually

43
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
overtook desktop browsing as the most

44
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,799
popular way that people are accessing

45
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,920
the web

46
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,439
this is important

47
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,960
and challenge for web privacy

48
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,799
measurement researchers because mobile

49
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
browsers run on mobile devices that have

50
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
additional sensors as compared to

51
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,560
desktop devices and mobile browsers

52
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,880
expose access to these sensors via

53
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,720
sensor apis that can be used for

54
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
tracking

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,360
however what we found at least at the

56
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,040
time of this paper is that there were

57
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,479
few studies that were taking the vantage

58
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,920
point on mobile browsing most of them

59
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
being focused on desktop browsing

60
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
we also found some cases of prior work

61
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
using emulated mobile browsers which are

62
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
desktop browsers running on desktop

63
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
devices that have been configured to

64
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,960
appear to websites as mobile browsers

65
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,119
these two observations led us to

66
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,200
research questions first

67
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
how do mainstream mobile and desktop

68
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
browsers actually compare in terms of

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
tracking and advertising

70
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
and second is it ecologically valid to

71
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,799
use emulated browsers in a web

72
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,880
measurement study

73
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,239
our final piece of motivation for this

74
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
work was the rise of privacy-focused

75
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,520
browsers

76
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
what we found on the android marketplace

77
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
is that there were many mobile browsers

78
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,160
that were claiming to be able to enhance

79
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
user's privacy in one way or another for

80
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,840
example firefox could focus claims to

81
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
build a block known ad analyzed and

82
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
social trackers duckduckgo claims to be

83
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
able to stop advertisers from tracking

84
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,879
you on the slides you visit ghostray

85
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,160
claims to be able to block trackers and

86
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
anonymize your data to further protect

87
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,879
your privacy

88
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
in total we gathered five browsers

89
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
making these such claims that had more

90
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
than one million downloads each that's

91
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,560
brave firefox focus the tour browser.go

92
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
and ghostfree off these browsers we

93
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
sought to ask two research questions

94
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
first how effective are these

95
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,680
privacy-focused browsers in blocking

96
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
tracking advertising

97
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
and second what are the strengths and

98
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
weaknesses of individual privacy focus

99
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
browsers are some more effective than

100
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
others

101
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
in order to answer these research

102
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
questions we need to develop an

103
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
infrastructure that was capable of doing

104
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
synchronized comparison of a single

105
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
website across multiple different

106
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
desktop and mobile browsers we developed

107
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
omnicrawl and it works like this first

108
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
we have a main crawler that dispatches

109
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,720
urls to be visited to a suite of desktop

110
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
browsers and mobile browsers running on

111
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,879
real devices these browsers will

112
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,280
dispatch dispatch a request for that url

113
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
to our proxy

114
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,319
which will forward the request to a web

115
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,920
server and we'll get back a response

116
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
which will allow us to determine what

117
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
first and third parties were loaded

118
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
then if the response has javascript that

119
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
javascript will be instrumented before

120
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,239
it is loaded by the browsers this

121
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
instrumentation will allow us to log

122
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,879
accesses to browser apis

123
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
these access logs will later then be

124
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
used to determine what apis were

125
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,239
accessed as well as whether potential

126
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
fingerprinting was occurring on the page

127
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
finally the proxy will send back a

128
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
signal to indicate that that url was

129
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
visited so that we can synchronize

130
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
between all of our browsers

131
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
we set up this infrastructure in north

132
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,400
america across two desktop browsers of

133
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
devices as well as nine

134
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
android 8.1 mobile phones each running

135
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
one browser we also replicated the setup

136
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
in asia for a total of 42 browsers

137
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
running across 22 physical devices

138
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,519
however for the purpose of this talk

139
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,959
we'll be focusing on the results from

140
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
the north american data set

141
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
having developed this infrastructure our

142
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
goal in crawling was to crawl both

143
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,358
popular high-ranked websites as well as

144
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,880
lower-ranked websites that are less

145
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,238
popular in order to gain a balanced

146
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,320
picture of the currency of web tracking

147
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,919
to do this we selected websites from the

148
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
tranco ranking which we used over the

149
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
more well-known alexa ranking for its

150
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
increased stability manipulation

151
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
resistance

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
from the tranquil ranking we selected

153
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,199
twenty thousand websites

154
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,960
all of the top ten thousand websites as

155
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,160
well as an additional ten thousand

156
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
websites selected uniformly one out of

157
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,840
every ten for rank ten thousand to rank

158
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
one hundred and ten thousand in order to

159
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,199
ensure that our data set also contained

160
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
lesser known sites

161
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,040
having gathered this data set our goal

162
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
in our analysis was to be able to

163
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
measure third party tracking advertising

164
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,280
as well as potential fingerprinting

165
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
behaviors of websites to do this we took

166
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,240
the http request data from the proxy and

167
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,600
first categorized request as either

168
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
being first or third party and the

169
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
second classified request as being

170
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,479
potentially tracking advertising by

171
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,680
checking to see if the request was

172
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
matched by one of many block lists we

173
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
included in our crawl and then

174
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
associating a third party tracking

175
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
advertising entity with a request using

176
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
a tool called webxray which for example

177
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
would allow you to take a request to

178
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,400
google analytics and associated with the

179
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
entity google

180
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,199
next on the api access side we first

181
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
categorized apis into a set of sensitive

182
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
api categories by function such as audio

183
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
automation canvas and so on

184
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
and then we used a set of fingerprinting

185
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
heuristics that were sourced from power

186
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
work to determine whether potential

187
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
kinds of fingerprinting were occurring

188
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,639
on the page such as web rtc

189
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
fingerprinting audio font canvas or

190
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
webgl

191
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
having gathered this data set i want to

192
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
mention one thing which is that we used

193
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
a statistical testing methodology to

194
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
establish the significance of our

195
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,720
results

196
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
if over the next few slides i mentioned

197
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,560
a significant difference i specifically

198
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
mean a statistically significant

199
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
difference

200
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,080
okay i won't have time to go over all of

201
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
our results in detail so instead i'm

202
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
going to be presenting a summary of some

203
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
foreign results

204
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
first for our first research question

205
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,199
which asks how do mainstream mobile and

206
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
desktop browsers compare in terms of

207
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
tracking advertising what we found

208
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,600
surprisingly is that the mobile specific

209
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
or mobile-only and desktop-specific

210
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,800
third-party tracking advertising

211
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
entities only accounted for 0.45 of the

212
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
request in our crawl indicating a

213
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
surprisingly low impact

214
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
this as well as other data led us to

215
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
conclude that the ecosystems of

216
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,240
third-party tracking advertising

217
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,479
entities are actually more homogeneous

218
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,080
across mobile and desktop than was

219
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
previously thought

220
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
however what we found is that while the

221
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,919
third-party tracking advertising

222
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,199
entities are essentially the same

223
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
between mobile and desktop they actually

224
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
behave differently on mobile on mobile

225
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
we saw more accesses to apis that were

226
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
indicative of fingerprinting

227
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
such as a 54 increase in the screen api

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
accesses as well as a 21 increase in

229
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,720
fingerprinting here six that pointed to

230
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
potential web rtc fingerprinting

231
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
occurring on the page

232
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,280
next looking at our second research

233
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,639
question which asks whether it is

234
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
ecologically valid to use emulate

235
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
browsers in a web measurement study what

236
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,199
we found is that openwp mobile which

237
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
takes desktop firefox running on a

238
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
desktop device and configures it to look

239
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,599
like mobile firefox running on a mobile

240
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,120
device actually experienced

241
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
significantly more requests and api

242
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
accesses than the real mobile firefox

243
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,479
running on a mobile device in particular

244
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
we saw six percent more third-party

245
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
tracking advertising requests as well as

246
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
50 more accesses to the plug-in api

247
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
which is actually desktop specific

248
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
this as well as additional data allowed

249
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,199
us to conclude that emulator browsers

250
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,880
may not actually be suitable for web

251
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,080
measurement studies where that are

252
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
attempting to measure third-party

253
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
requests or browser api accesses

254
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
now shifting gears to look at our

255
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
privacy focus browsers we first ask how

256
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
effective are privacy focus browsers at

257
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
blocking tracker and advertising

258
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
and what we find is that while privacy

259
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479
focus browsers as a group do actually

260
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,400
reduce their by tracking advertising on

261
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,280
average they do not uniformly reduce

262
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,479
third-party tracking advertising

263
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,599
requests

264
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,280
in particular we found that they are

265
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
only most effective for the most highly

266
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,440
prevalent entities such as top three

267
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,759
google facebook and adobe systems where

268
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
for example we see a 60 reduction in

269
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,680
third-party tracking advertising

270
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,599
requests attributable to google

271
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
next looking at our last question which

272
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
asks what are the strengths and

273
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
weaknesses of the individual privacy

274
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,479
focus browsers

275
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,160
what we find is that while they are

276
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
generally effective at reducing third

277
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
party tracking advertising

278
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,759
they actually can vary widely in their

279
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
effectiveness for example looking at

280
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
third-party tracking advertising

281
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
requests we see that the torah browser

282
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,599
for example has 13 times as many of

283
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
these requests as firefox focus

284
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
considering api accesses we see that the

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
brave browser actually is 25 less than

286
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,320
the privacy focus browsers as a group

287
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
what we also found concerning

288
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
concerningly is that there were several

289
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
privacy-focused browsers that deviated

290
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,800
from what they said in their marketing

291
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
claims for example the tor browser and

292
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
sparking claims claimed to be able to do

293
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
tracker blocking however we found that

294
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,519
this claim was unsupported because at

295
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,200
the time of our study the top browser

296
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
did not actually include any add or

297
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,160
tracker blocking plugins

298
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
okay with these

299
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,279
answers to the research questions in

300
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,560
mind we developed a set of

301
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
recommendations both for future web

302
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
measurement studies and for privacy

303
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
focus browser vendors

304
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
first looking at our recommendations for

305
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
future web measurement study design

306
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
first we recommend that future web

307
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
measurement studies avoid the use of

308
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
emulated mobile browsers when mobile

309
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,600
specific measurements are required

310
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
emulated mobile browsers must emulate

311
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
all the hardware level characteristics

312
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
of real mobile devices which is

313
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
extremely difficult to do due to

314
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
hardware level variations and specific

315
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
components that these browsers use

316
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,959
as a result it's quite difficult to get

317
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
the emulation correct and there is a

318
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
high likelihood that there will be

319
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
differences in the api access results

320
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
that will lead websites to be able to

321
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
detect that the emulated mobile browser

322
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
is actually a desktop browser running on

323
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,040
a desktop device

324
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
second we recommend that future web

325
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
management studies modify off-the-shelf

326
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
browser drivers such as selenium before

327
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
using them we've found for example that

328
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
sliding will inject properties into the

329
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
web page

330
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
into the dom specifically that websites

331
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,000
can and do detect

332
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
this can lead to the website modifying

333
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
its behavior in a way that affects the

334
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,519
ecological validity of the study

335
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,440
next looking at our recommendations for

336
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
privacy focused browser vendors

337
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
first we recommend that they clarify the

338
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
concrete implications of all their

339
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
marketing clients

340
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
and not use unsubstantiated terminology

341
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
such as tracker blocking without really

342
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
explaining what the implications are

343
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
this will allow users to better pick the

344
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
browser that meets their specific

345
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
privacy needs

346
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
second we recommend that privacyforce

347
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
browser vendors offer users much more

348
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
fine-grained control over blocking

349
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
comprehensiveness we found several cases

350
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,079
where browsers will

351
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
select between the trade-offs between

352
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
performance and blocking

353
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
comprehensiveness for users without

354
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
really offering users a choice in how

355
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,519
that's configured however we suggest

356
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,200
that users be given more control so they

357
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
can pick

358
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,320
the right balance between those two for

359
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
their privacy needs

360
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,640
finally what i want to say is that we

361
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
have many more details available in the

362
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,160
paper so please check that out and we

363
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
also have an artifact available at this

364
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,040
url

365
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
using this artifact will allow you to

366
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
run omnicrawl with a selection of

367
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
browsers and replicate the results of

368
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,439
our management study

369
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,720
thank you so much for your time and

370
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
attention
