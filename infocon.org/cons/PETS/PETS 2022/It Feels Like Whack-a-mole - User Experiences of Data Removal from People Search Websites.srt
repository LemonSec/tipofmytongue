hi my name is casey taka and i'm a phd

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,520
student at new york university while i

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,360
really wish i could be there in sydney

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,440
today i'm very excited to present our

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
work remotely

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,799
and happy to answer questions in the

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,440
time remaining after the title of our

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
paper is it feels like guacamole user

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
experiences of data removal from the

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
people search website it's a

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
collaboration between authors at three

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
universities a new york university

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,238
technical institute at the university of

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,200
lisbon and drexel university

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
there has been a good amount of research

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
on users privacy right and the influence

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
of privacy regulation our research

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,800
complements prior work by studying user

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
experiences in the context of people

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
search website where information is

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
publicly available and easily accessible

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,360
other related work has studied internet

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
users risk perceptions as well as

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,079
factors impacting security and privacy

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,199
behaviors

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,280
some of the factors impacting security

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
and privacy behaviors are skill levels

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
and socioeconomic statuses as well as

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,520
psychological factors

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,479
but first what are people search website

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,119
while there is no formal definition for

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,439
people search websites prior work has

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,000
defined them as one of the services that

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,439
data brokers offer or as a separate data

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,759
broker type altogether

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,079
sources of information

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,799
typically are government records other

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,000
public records or commercial sources

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
more concretely if you've ever google

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,439
search yourself or someone else chances

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,759
are you have encountered these sites

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
they usually display individuals name

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
and physical location some of them

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,640
advertise themselves as reverse phone

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,439
number directories or even suggest more

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,240
specific use cases like intimate partner

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
surveillance

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
the proliferation of people search

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,840
websites that publicly display one's

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
private information has led to the

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
emergence of businesses that offer

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
information removal service for a fee

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,840
in this presentation from now on we will

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,560
refer to the companies as removal

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
services

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
with this work we set out to answer

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,920
three primary research questions what

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
are users perceptions of the people

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
search website what steps are required

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
to accomplish removal how is the

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,000
experience of using a removal service

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
these three questions help us come up

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
with suggestions and recommendations

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
about how the removal service can be

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
improved

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
before we get into our findings we will

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,080
briefly describe our method

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,720
this work is mostly based on qualitative

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
insight extracted from semi-structured

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
interviews with 18 participants we use

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
the pre-script inning survey to filter

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
out those with no removal experiences

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
and had a group representing almost all

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,760
ages

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
skewed towards individuals with higher

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
level of education

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
transcriptions of interviews were

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
analyzed using thematic analysis an

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
inductive intuitive approach to coding

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
with a goal of finding themes in the

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
data

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
the screening survey the stem is

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
structured interview script as well as

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
more detailed on our details on our

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,360
recruitment methods as well as analysis

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,519
process are included in the paper

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
moving on to our findings and results we

88
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,720
found that the participants

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
risks perceptions of having pii publicly

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
available were the primary motivation to

91
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,080
seek removal they perceived

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
the risks they perceived mostly fell

93
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,640
under two categories direct and indirect

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,760
use of publicly available pii

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
the most common risk perception

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
associated with direct use of publicly

97
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,360
available pii was online harassment

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
followed by identity theft concerns

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,959
online harassment was perceived to also

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
be a cause of reputation damage mental

101
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,840
health impact and loss of physical

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
safety

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
as the quote on the right describes

104
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
publicly available pii on the internet

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
closes the

106
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
geographical distance between the

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
attacker and the target and multiple

108
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,639
participants describe their fear of the

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
attacker finding their address and

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
harming them

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,039
physically

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
however perceived risks were also

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
associated with indirect use of the

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
information three participants mention

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
words related to the linkability among

116
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,800
different types of pi

117
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
one of them was particularly concerned

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
with the limited number of data points

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
necessary to identify a unique us

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
citizen

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,520
three participants mentioned the

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,080
cambridge analytica incident and one of

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,880
them explained how additional cues can

124
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,600
be inferred from what initially looks

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
like just superficial personal

126
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
information

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
some of the other themes that we

128
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,680
encountered during the interviews were

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
related to the perception of people

130
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
search website

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919
multiple participants explained thinking

132
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,240
that the sites have dubious information

133
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,120
handling practices and sometimes add

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
artificial pieces of information to gain

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
more user clicks

136
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,479
they also perceive that the sites have

137
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,840
comprehensive information

138
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,880
collection methods and are supplied by a

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,400
variety of sources of information

140
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
three of the participants described

141
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
being not surprised that their

142
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
information was there mostly because of

143
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
the ever increasing amount of data that

144
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
is gathered by our online activities

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,919
other participants expressed concern

146
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,680
that the online availability and

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
decreased cost make it easier to gain

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
access to an individual pii

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
this means that access is now accessible

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
to everyone on the internet among whom

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
also attackers with

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,919
malicious intent

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,639
we talk to participants about the

154
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
approaches they followed to remove

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
information while some of the opted for

156
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,759
removal services that we mentioned

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
briefly before most attempted to remove

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
information by themselves one of the

159
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
participants had been seeking removal

160
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
since mid-2000 and explains that the

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
removal process has evolved and gotten

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
easier through the years

163
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
however most participants describe

164
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
encountering usability issues when

165
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,960
seeking removal one of such examples is

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
id verification even though not very

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
popular and mostly common in the past

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
other dark patterns reported were

169
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,919
difficulties finding removal instruction

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
obfuscated or inactive removal form

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
links

172
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
which participants perceive as a

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
deliberate attempt to discourage them

174
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,720
from removal and aiming to maximize

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
profits of the sites

176
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
multiple participants explained that

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
removal is not final and in order to

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
guarantee a satisfactory level of

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
privacy one needs to continuously submit

180
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,039
to removal requests for this reason one

181
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,840
of them describes removal requests as

182
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,199
band-aids on the problem

183
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
as previously mentioned using a removal

184
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
service is also an option and six

185
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
participants opted for it

186
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
in general participants had good

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
understanding of the service being

188
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
offered and perceive the services as a

189
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
way of throwing money at the problem

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
while avoiding the time consuming diy

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,599
process

192
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
one participant describes the removal

193
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,599
service as harassment preventing tool

194
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,479
however removal services require many

195
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,960
types of pii as part of their signing

196
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,479
process

197
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,440
two of the participants we interviewed

198
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
described feeling uncomfortable when

199
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
supplying this information

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
another concern expressed by a user is

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
the lack of contextualization of the

202
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
regular removal report

203
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
similar to the experience of

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,759
participants doing the removal

205
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
themselves those using the service also

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
explained that the removal is not final

207
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,599
and they mentioned being aware that they

208
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,080
have to continuously pay for the service

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
if they want to keep their information

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,559
off of the internet

211
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
for more findings we suggest you to look

212
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
at the paper

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
now we want to outline recommendations

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
for user removal services and third

215
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,040
parties based on our qualitative

216
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,399
interviews

217
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
for users who are doing removal

218
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
themselves we recommend taking detailed

219
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,080
notes which can be helpful in going back

220
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
to a confirm if removal was successful

221
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,080
and dedicating uh and setting amount

222
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
significant and setting apart

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,320
significant amount of time for this

224
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
purpose for those who are not able to do

225
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,399
so removal services are a great way to

226
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,040
save time

227
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
for removal services to improve their

228
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,080
service we recommend increasing

229
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
transparency and contextualization in

230
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
their regular report as well as offering

231
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
privacy and security guarantees for

232
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
their customers

233
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,920
however also third parties could help

234
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
transform the landscape of people search

235
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
websites by creating and enforcing

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
regulation investing investigating dark

237
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,959
patterns and through regular audits

238
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
researchers and non-profit organizations

239
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,080
could work on automated removal methods

240
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,320
removal guides and sessions for

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
marginalized and at risk populations

242
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,079
to summarize through this study we

243
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
learned that participants seek removal

244
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
from a variety of reasons among which

245
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,959
online harassment and financial concerns

246
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,279
are the most popular but they often also

247
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,399
have other privacy concerns

248
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,680
uh we

249
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
discovered that removal is time

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
consuming and continues and information

251
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,800
is uh very likely to show again in this

252
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
site

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
therefore we conclude that

254
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
self-management of privacy by attempting

255
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,200
to keep information of the internet is

256
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,519
difficult and its success it's hard to

257
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,519
evaluate

258
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,480
um

259
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
thank you and i'm happy to take any

260
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
questions
