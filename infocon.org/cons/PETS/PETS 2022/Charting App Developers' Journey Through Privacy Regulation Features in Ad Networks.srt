1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,960
hi thank you very much for attending our

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,359
talk today my name is muhammad tahi i

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,839
did this research with marvin ramakopone

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,080
and owais rashid from the university of

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
bristol and tianjili and jason hong from

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,360
carnegie mellon university why did we

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,039
study advertising networks about 77 of

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,240
free android apps contain an app library

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
and that only includes ad libraries on

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
android apps considering this number

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,159
and thinking about the whole mobile app

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
development ecosystem

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
ad networks collect massive data from

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,879
users including sensitive data such as

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,719
location data

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,760
mobile app developers on one hand feel

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
like they have to use these libraries

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,480
because they enable them to make money

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
and on the other hand some users find

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,480
ads specially personalized ads creepy

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
because for example they search about

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
something on a website and when they go

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,960
back to a different website they see

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
some ads that are relevant to the to

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,159
their initial search

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
which creeps them out because they feel

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,799
like they are being followed and tracked

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,000
or some users find ads discriminating

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
because some ads might offer different

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
prices to different users and some

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,200
people find ads in general intrusive

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,759
because of laws and regulations ad

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,400
networks must provide options

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
in certain regions to limit ads

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
personalization for example in the us

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
and in europe they have to give users

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
options to make a decision between

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
personalized and non-personalized ads

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
there have been many research trying to

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
find out how these options should be

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
presented to users so that they can

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,880
understand them better and make an

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
informed decision

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
for example carnegie mellon university

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,840
researchers

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
designed this icon for ccpa

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
however when we look at the developer

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
side there are also many options given

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,360
to developers to turn off ads

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,959
personalization

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
yet there hasn't been many research to

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
study these interfaces

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
here you can see three interfaces

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
provided by admit works from facebook

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
twitter and google although twitter

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
recently sold their ad network to a

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
different company

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
there are multiple ways of showing these

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,480
kinds of options to developers with code

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
level interfaces or graphical interfaces

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,319
and choices

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,160
in our study we wanted to better

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,319
understand these options and information

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
presented to developers

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
in a short paper in kai 2021

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,280
we studied some of these interfaces and

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,519
found that these options can be very

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,680
tricky for developers to find and

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,959
understand

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
and some of them even contain dark

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
patterns

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
if you don't know what a dark pattern is

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,200
here's an example

74
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,560
this screenshot was posted on reddit so

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
the user saw these interfaces

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,720
when installing an hp printer hp in the

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,519
fourth option is asking users to turn on

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
their location services and allow

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
precise location

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
as you can see users aren't given any

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
options but just to share their precise

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
location

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
and they don't have any other options to

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,799
cancel or say i don't want to do this

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,720
if they don't want to do this they have

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
to just cancel the setup process and

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
return the printer

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,879
so this interface really feels

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,239
restrictive and limiting

90
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
we observe similar patterns in the ad

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,040
networks on the developer panels for

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
example the default options were set to

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
maximize data collection or the coloring

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
and the order of the options

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,640
were very much in favor of the platform

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,238
and maximizing data sharing

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
as a follow-up study in this research we

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
wanted to answer three research

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,439
questions first we wanted to understand

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,920
how do athlete works present information

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000
about privacy regulations in their

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
documentation so we wanted to understand

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,440
if we take gdpr ccpa and copa as some of

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
the common privacy regulations how are

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
these regulations presented in the

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
developer facing documentation

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,199
and then we wanted to understand how

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
developers find these ad networks

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
support for complying with privacy

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,199
regulations

111
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,240
and third we wanted to understand how ad

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,479
networks can improve their privacy

113
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,000
regulation support for developers

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
we did two studies to answer our

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,000
research questions in the first study

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,919
we did a systematic review of the

117
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
interfaces

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
in which we exhaustively tried to find

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
all the interfaces that contain some

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
information about the privacy

121
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,520
regulations

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
in the second study

123
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
with the think allowed with 11 mobile

124
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,039
app developers

125
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,680
to better understand developers concerns

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
confusions and recommendations to

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
improve ad network support for

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
developers

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
i'm going to talk about the findings

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
briefly

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
here you can see the results from the

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
systematic review we studied three

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,160
popular ad networks

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,479
google ad pop facebook audience network

135
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,960
and twitter mopop

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
here's an example of the charts that we

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
made this is from google admob all the

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
little colored circles show that there

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,199
is some information in that interface or

140
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
page about the privacy regulation so you

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,280
might notice the vast number of pages

142
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
and how scattered the information is

143
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,320
another point is that some of these

144
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
interfaces are buried under multiple

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,759
levels

146
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
which makes it very difficult for a

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
developer to find

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,039
here's a table

149
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,520
that we created from the charts

150
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
so the first thing that you might notice

151
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
when you look at this table is that

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
there are many inconsistencies between

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
these platforms which means that

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
developers have to do a lot of the work

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,120
themselves to find all the relevant

156
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
information

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
the information within each platforms is

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,639
also very inconsistent for example take

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
copa on twitter mob it has six pages

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
but for gdpr on the same platform there

161
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
are 18 pages some

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
with a code sample and some without the

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,199
code sample so overall all the

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
regulations are addressed very

165
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,520
differently on each of these ad networks

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,560
and even within an ad network each

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,639
regulation has been addressed very

168
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,280
differently

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
in the second study we did think about

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
the study with 11 mobile app developers

171
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
they find it very difficult to

172
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
understand the terms and the language of

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
these ad networks

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,319
around regulations and laws

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,720
sometimes there is just so much detail

176
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
on a page that no one wants to read

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
those pages and on the other hand

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,639
sometimes

179
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,120
there was just no detail at all on some

180
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
pages so finding the right balance

181
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
between the right amount of detail for

182
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
developers is a challenge

183
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,440
on top of that

184
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
as we also found in the systematic

185
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,840
review it's very difficult to find the

186
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
relevant information about privacy

187
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,479
regulations sometimes some of our

188
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,639
participants gave up and said i don't

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,599
want

190
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,720
i don't know where to find the

191
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
information about this a specific term

192
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
or topic

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
as with the previous findings sometimes

194
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
the information was buried under

195
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
multiple levels and scattered in many

196
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,239
different pages

197
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,639
some of the strategies that our

198
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,039
participants said that they will use to

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
make their applications compliant with

200
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,800
the regulations where for example

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,039
just following the documentation for

202
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,479
example p4 said google has given us two

203
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,360
keys or saving two values i would just

204
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,720
use those values in my app if it's just

205
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
children directed and i would just relax

206
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
which really puts a lot of the burden on

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
the documentation of these platforms and

208
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
how much trust developers put on these

209
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,799
platforms

210
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
for compliance checking

211
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,880
for example p9 said

212
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,600
it's impossible to check for compliance

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
because i want to make sure that my app

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
complied with ccpa and copa but they

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,240
haven't they hadn't given me any kind of

216
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
information like technical information

217
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,279
on how to do it

218
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
what do developers want

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
they want to see videos

220
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
there are videos on these platforms

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,160
about how to make an app functional or

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
how to integrate an ad

223
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
but none of these videos talk about

224
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,120
privacy regulations and privacy topics

225
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
they want to see more sample code of

226
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
course this is a classic developers want

227
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,760
to see more sample code because that

228
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
helps them understand what's going on

229
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
and potentially they can copy paste and

230
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
modify the few values and get their app

231
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,839
working

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
they want to see step-by-step

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
documentation for privacy topics very

234
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
very much like how ad networks currently

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
have for integrating an ad which is very

236
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
nicely laid out and everything is very

237
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,880
nicely laid out

238
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,600
it has all the details step by step

239
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
so it would be nice to have the privacy

240
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
information integrated in those

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
documentation as well

242
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
they want to see easily accessible

243
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,160
options

244
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,399
specifically graphical configuration

245
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
like a simple checkbox or some radio

246
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,440
buttons

247
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,760
so that they can just select instead of

248
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,959
changing something in their code

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,519
and finally most of them want to see all

250
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760
the privacy related information in one

251
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,279
place in a central panel

252
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,839
we find that overall the information

253
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,160
about privacy regulations can be very

254
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
hard for developers developers to find

255
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,519
compliance is a different topic for now

256
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
we are just trying to find out if they

257
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
can find the information or not

258
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,839
we find that understanding usability

259
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,320
issues in these interfaces and improving

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
them may facilitate performing privacy

261
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,800
tasks for developers

262
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
and take some of the burden of

263
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
developers

264
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,279
we argue that these interfaces need to

265
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,959
remove dark patterns and give

266
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
transparent options to developers to

267
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,839
enable them to make informed decisions

268
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,360
for their users and their apps

269
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,839
thank you for listening
