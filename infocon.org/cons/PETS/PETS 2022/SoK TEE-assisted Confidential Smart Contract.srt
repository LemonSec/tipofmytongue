00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,560
hi everyone i am jin today we are going

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,000
to talk about an slk on the topic of te

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,639
assisted confidential smart contract in

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
this work we will explore plenty of

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,560
existing related literature and in

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,840
production projects

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,039
specifically our work includes the

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,760
following contents we first introduced

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,240
the concept of de-assisted confidential

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
smart contracts we then propose our

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
evaluation from work to give a

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
high-level view of this work

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
we evaluate both the desirable

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
properties for the smart contractor

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,000
services and the potential issues for

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
the blockchain system lastly we point

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
out the research challenges and give

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
some research insights

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,559
the smart contractor is a computer

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
program stored on a blockchain and

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,680
running in a distributed network the

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,480
contract has two major properties of

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
automatic execution and non-impulcation

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
automatic execution means a smart

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
contract can force one entity to execute

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,640
operations based on predefined logic

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,240
non-equivocation means each distributed

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
nodes can hold a global view of the

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,439
state at a specific height supporting

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,320
more efficient settlement

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
however using smart contracts still

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,960
confront many challenges

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,920
the most identical drawback is the lack

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
of confidentiality

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
the operation code and the contracted

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
state are completely transparent and any

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,079
state and exchanges are publicly

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
accessible and observable

39
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
for instance smart contracts in ethereum

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,159
cannot be directly applied to the volume

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,360
to applications which is the

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,600
victory auction and the voting

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
application the bid and the vote

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,799
required to be hidden from the public

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,520
but this cannot be realized for

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,840
transparent on-chain smart contracts

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
different from the conventional smart

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
contract a confidential smart contractor

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
aims to help the contractor state so

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
that the public cannot see any useful

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,079
knowledge of the states

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
currently many technical privacy

53
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,560
preserving solutions have been proposed

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,959
such as the techniques of their

55
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,920
knowledge proof multiparty computation

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,319
and homomorphic encryption

57
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
however the solution requires an

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
increasing of computation complexity

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
making executions run slowly

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,360
in this work we focus on the trusted

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
execution environment technique which is

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
short for the tee

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
tee can protect the data in use by

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,200
performing computation in a hardware

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
based environment there are four major

66
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
features in te namely the confidential

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
execution sitting technology local

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,119
attestation and the remote attestation

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,519
we introduced the notion of te assisted

70
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,720
confidential smart contracts it combines

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
the hardware basically to existing

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
blockchain architecture especially in

73
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
its storage layer

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
the participants will equip the te into

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,400
their operating nodes ensuring every

76
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
input output and execution can be

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
physically sealed

78
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
although various tcsa protocols have

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,879
been proposed newly released projects

80
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
may fail to draw upon the experience

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
learned from existing protocols such as

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
repeating known design mistakes or

83
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,799
applying cryptography in unsecured ways

84
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,200
we in this paper aim to

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
obstruct a high-level framework to

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
simply and clearly systemize the

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,599
knowledge on current tcs6 schemes

88
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,319
we attempt to capture some comments

89
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,720
among this project regarding their

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,199
features properties and the potential

91
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,720
security vulnerabilities

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,199
here we introduced our unified

93
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,759
evaluation framework we consider two

94
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,880
parts the smart contractor used as

95
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
services and the underlying supporting

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
blockchain systems

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
based on their operating mechanisms and

98
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,639
the ways of combination will investigate

99
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,960
and the category

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
set off typical protocols into two main

101
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,639
classifications the layer 1 solutions

102
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,440
and the layer 2 solutions the framework

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
covers corresponding to a specs

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
desirable properties for contracted

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
services and the security consideration

106
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,080
for underlying systems specifically we

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
discuss the desirable properties from

108
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,919
typical properties that inherit from the

109
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,240
traditional smart contracts and the

110
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
featured privacy related properties

111
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
meanwhile we emphasize practical issues

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
pitfalls and the remedies in designing

113
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,320
te assisted blockchains

114
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,520
before diving into specific evaluations

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
we provide a lighting tour of how a

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
typical confidential smart contractor

117
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
operates

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
totally four steps i included

119
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
loading the inputs into the contractor

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
engine

121
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,039
computation inside the te

122
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,520
conducting consensus and returns the

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
outputs we classify current solutions

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
into lyra and layer 2 by investigating

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
whether the step 2 or step 3 are

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
accepted within the same pe

127
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,639
for layer run solutions all the

128
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,039
operations are operated within the same

129
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,240
te whereas for the layer 2 solutions

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,759
step 2 and step 3 are separate but still

131
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
within the same note

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
here we present our identified details

133
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
in terms of desirable properties we

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,120
evaluate each tcsc system from two

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,160
aspects mainly from its privacy

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
preserving property and the blockchain

137
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
intrinsic feature

138
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
the privacy preserving properties

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,280
include specification hidden input

140
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
output privacy

141
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
procedure privacy and the address and

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
linkability and the anonymity

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
the blockchain intrinsic feature

144
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
contains the immutability consistency

145
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,639
interoperability availability

146
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,160
decentralization automation

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,199
reliability and some specific mechanisms

148
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
as for the security consideration we

149
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
give out discussions from the following

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,960
aspects in terms of ote components t

151
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
hosts the security for punishment and

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
the incentive mechanisms and for

153
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
tolerance and

154
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,360
authentication this mainly targets on

155
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
the holster level

156
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,919

priority restriction and the chain data

163
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
confirmation and the output conflicts

164
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
this mainly targets on the code level

165
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,560
t key security for distributed case key

166

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,759
keys is mainly targeted on the key level

169
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,960
based on our evaluation framework we

170
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,520
provide detailed evaluation results

171
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
towards 17 in the world projects

172
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
we analyze each of them with our

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
evaluation matrix and summarize the

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,720
altitude with two large tables

175
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,120
here we give a very concise version to

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,080
compare the features of both layer 1

177
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,720
solution and layer 2 solution layer 1

178
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,680
solutions are mainly built on the top of

179
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
consortium blockchains where the layer 2

180
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,399
solutions are based on the public

181
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,039
blockchains the layer 1 solutions are

182
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
good idea is system availability and the

183
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,120
layer 2 solutions for performance will

184
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
add the scalability

185
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,600
lastly we point out the research

186
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,640
challenges of tcsc protocols we give

187
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
three types of disadvantages existing in

188
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
the current systems

189
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,320
the sad channel attack is inevitable

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,959
because all types of tea suffer from

191
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,839
such attacks this cannot be

192
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,240
avoided by the software

193
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
the key management designer refers to

194
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
two specs

195
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
firstly putting the application keys in

196
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,640
a single te

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,519
will contribute to the key security but

198
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
also increase the risk of single point

199
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
failure attack

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,399
secondly sharing the private key among

201
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,959
multiple tests offer

202
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,839
practical availability but increases the

203
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,240
key as filtration risk

204
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
the third issue is the transparency

205
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240
various

206
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,279
the precise architectures of chips are

207
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,000
still unclear for some tea products

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
meanwhile the attestation survey is used

209
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
to prove that a program runs inside tea

210
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,399
is non-transparent

211
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,839
finally we summarize this work as

212
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,880
follows

213
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
we provided a systemization of existing

214
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
tcsc systems driven from academic work

215
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,480
and in production projects

216
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,279
we established a unified evaluation

217
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,519
framework for confidential smart

218
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,800
contractor systems we consider two parts

219
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
the smart contractor used as services

220
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
and the underlying supportive blockchain

221
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
systems

222
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
we conduct a comparative analysis of

223
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,560
existing protocols based on our

224
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,440
evaluation framework we discuss the

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
systems

226
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
both from the their common designs and

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,320
the distinguishing features

228
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,399
we further give a comprehensive

229
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,680
discussion of current designs and

230
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,519
implementations comparisons between the

231
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,079
layer 1 and layer 2 systems from the

232
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
perspective of security

233
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
efficiency and easy adoption and the

234
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
common issues on

235
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,040
public variability we also point out the

236
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
research challenges in this field

237
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
here are the references used in this

238
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
work

239
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,000
we stand for your listening
