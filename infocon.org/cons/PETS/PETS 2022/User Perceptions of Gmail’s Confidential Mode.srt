00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
hi everyone my name is yusra javed and

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,480
i'm an assistant professor at illinois

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,480
state university today i'm going to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
present my findings on user perceptions

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
of gmail's confidential mode this work

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,880
was done in collaboration with

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
researchers at unc charlotte we're all

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,359
familiar with ephemeral communication

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,199
that is possible through social media

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,640
applications such as snapchat instagram

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
whatsapp and messenger we are

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
self-destructing chat messages and media

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,519
that expire after being viewed or as

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,719
stories that expire after 24 hours

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
this achieves the notion of privacy a

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
similar feature was introduced by gmail

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
in 2018 for ephemeral communication and

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
access control in email this feature is

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,239
known as confidential mode and its icon

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,719
is represented by a lock with a timer

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
symbol within the message composition

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
window users can turn on the

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
confidential mode by clicking on this

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
icon which leads to this window the

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
confidential mode does not perform

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
end-to-end encryption on the email

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
however it allows gmail users to set an

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,119
expiration date by specifying the amount

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,200
of time the email will be accessible to

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,600
the recipient the default option is one

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,680
week it also allows the sender to

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
require an sms passcode which is a

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
one-time passcode to verify the

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
recipients before they can access the

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
email content this mode also prevents

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,640
recipients from forwarding copying

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
printing or downloading email contents

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,759
or attachments here is a snapshot of a

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,840
user composing an email with gmail's

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
confidential mode we can see that there

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,320
are two photos attached with this email

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
and that the content expires on june

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
24th 2022 here is the sender's view

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
after sending the email the sender can

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,320
revoke access to the email before its

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,799
scheduled expiration date by clicking

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
here here is a snapshot of the

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
recipient's view of the confidential

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,040
email gmail removes the email's body and

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
any attachments from the recipient's

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
copy of the email these are replaced

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
with a link to the emails content and

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,360
attachments email clients then make the

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
linked content appear as if it is part

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,920
of the email upon clicking on the link

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
we can see the email content and that

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480
there are two photo attachments however

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
these cannot be downloaded to view them

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
the user will click on them and they

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
will open in the browser like this the

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
same applies for word documents as well

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,480
as pdf files etc if the sender has also

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
required the use of an sms passcode to

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,879
verify the recipient's identity before

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,959
they view the email content

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
then this window will appear upon

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
clicking on the confidential email in

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
case the sender deletes or revokes

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
access to the email before the set

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,599
expiration date then the recipient would

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
see this window upon clicking on the

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
confidential email this will say that

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
the email has expired now a wide amount

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
of literature exists on studying the

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
usability and effectiveness of

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
end-to-end email encryption tools

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
however to the best of our knowledge

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
user perceptions and motivations for

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,879
sending private emails using

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,519
confidentiality tool such as gmail's

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
confidential mode have not been explored

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
this paper therefore explores three

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
research questions number one what

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
motivates users to use the confidential

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,200
mode number two what are users

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,599
perceptions of the confidential mode and

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
number three do users understand the

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
features of this mode these include

89
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
expiration time passcode requirement

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
permission restriction and pre-expiry

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
access revocation in order to understand

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
the user's perceptions and motivations

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,080
of gmail's confidential mode we

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
conducted structured interviews with

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
gmail users who were aged 18 and above

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
and had used gmail's confidential mode

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
in the past we confirmed participants

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,000
eligibility before interviewing them our

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
participants were recruited from unc

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
charlotte through an email announcement

101
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,799
the interviews were conducted in person

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,200
as well as over zoom due to the ongoing

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
covet situation participants audio

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,680
responses were recorded in both settings

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
in person as well as overzoom however no

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,319
personal or confidential information of

107
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
participants or third persons was

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,879
captured in audio or during screen

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,439
sharing the audio data was transcribed

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,959
and quoted by two researchers

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
independently the two sets of coded data

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
were then compared and discussed to

113
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,079
produce final codes after resolving any

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
disagreements the quora data was

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,479
analyzed qualitatively using an

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
inductive approach the interview was

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,120
divided into three parts in phase one of

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
the interview the participants were

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,960
asked a set of demographic questions and

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
questions regarding their motivations

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
for using confidential mode in other

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
words whether they used it for specific

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
people or for a particular content type

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
and why they used it next the

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
participants performed a set of tasks

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,320
including composing a confidential mode

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,160
email and thinking aloud as they

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
performed the task we were interested in

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
knowing what confidential mode meant to

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
the participants whether they confused

131
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
it with encryption and whether they

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
understood the mode's features for

133
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
achieving confidentiality in the last

134
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
phase the participants were asked to

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
review their past confidential mode

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
emails and answer a set of questions

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
related to these emails we investigated

138
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
whether the participants understood the

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
features of this mode for achieving

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
confidentiality these include setting an

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
expiration date on the content requiring

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
an sms passcode revoking message access

143
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,960
before expiration date and preventing

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
the recipients from forwarding

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
downloading or printing the content and

146
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
attachments of the emails each interview

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
session lasted for an average of 25

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
minutes and the participants were

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
rewarded with a five dollar gift card

150
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
the study was approved by the

151
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,479
university's institutional review board

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
we recruited a total of 19 participants

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,360
from unc charlotte the majority of our

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
participants were females aged 18 to 39

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
years regarding the highest level of

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
education achieved majority of the

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
participants had at least completed high

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
school or bachelor's degree or

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
participants were mostly students but a

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
few of them had full-time employment our

161
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
sample therefore possessed a high

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
technical skill as a majority of them

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,199
were from stem major when asked about

164
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
the motivations for using confidential

165
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
mode in their emails a majority of the

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
participants 12 out of 19 mentioned that

167
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
they use it to share confidential

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
documents other reasons for which

169
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
participants use gcm email was to

170
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
prevent unauthorized access for

171
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
encryption due to curiosity as a

172
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
replacement of the physical environment

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
when sharing documents sharing

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,639
information via email securely during

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
pandemic and as a requirement when

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
sharing work documents we also asked the

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
participants about the type of

178
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,919
recipients for which they use gcm email

179
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,440
we found that a majority of the

180
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
participants 11 out of 19 send a gcm

181
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
email to their family members and close

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
relatives other type of recipients

183
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
include administrative team members

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
financial employees for sending

185
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
confidential financial documents team

186
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,599
members in a project at school or office

187
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,360
medical personnel for sending medical

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
documents and leasing office staff for

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,919
sending these documents in regards to

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
the content present in our participants

191
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,919
confidential mode emails we found

192
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
several types including both private

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
non-work documents and work-related

194
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
documents as well as other sensitive

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,440
documents such as financial tax legal

196
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
and medical documents when the

197
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
participants composed a confidential

198
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,919
email they articulated their thoughts on

199
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,080
how confidentiality is achieved in this

200
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
mode and whether the composed email was

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
encrypted or not a majority of the

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
participants mentioned that

203
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,520
confidentiality is achieved through the

204
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
expiration date feature or by preventing

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
the recipient from being able to forward

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
copy download or print the contents of

207
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
the email some participants also

208
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
mentioned authentication via the

209
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
passcode requirement as well as by

210
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,800
including confidential links or by

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
enabling a high level of encryption a

212
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
majority of the participants 11 out of

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
19 believed that the confidential mode

214
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,000
also performs encryption on the email

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,879
content via its security features

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
however eight of our participants were

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,120
either unsure or correctly mentioned

218
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
that it does not perform encryption on

219
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
the email content we also asked the

220
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
participants to evaluate their last few

221
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,599
emails that they sent in confidential

222
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
mode and answer a set of questions

223
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
related to their use of confidential

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
mode features we wanted to know how and

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,319
why they used these features and what

226
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
confidence they had in how to use these

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
features on a scale from one to five

228
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
where five indicates high confidence

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
first we looked at the expiration time

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,199
feature a majority of our participants

231
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
used the default expiration time of one

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
week and used this feature to send

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
attachments such as sensitive documents

234
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
the reasons for using this feature was

235
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
to prevent unauthorized access for

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
instance if the user's email account is

237
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,959
accidentally left logged in at multiple

238
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
devices or locations and to give

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
temporal access to the content the

240
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
participants did not choose a shorter

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
expiration time because of the concern

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
that emails might delete themselves

243
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,440
before they were read by the recipients

244
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
our participants average confidence

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,160
rating in using this feature was 4.1 out

246
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
of 5. overall our participants had a

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
high understanding of the confidential

248
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,519
modes expiration time feature next we

249
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
looked at the passcode requirement

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,519
feature eight of our participants used

251
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
the passcode requirement feature to

252
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
prevent unauthorized access to use

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
two-factor authentication and to ensure

254
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
email privacy and safety the remaining

255
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,320
participants did not use their sms

256
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
passcode feature in their email because

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
they were using another security tool

258
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
for authentication or they believed that

259
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
this feature was inconvenient or

260
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
unnecessary or they trusted the

261
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
recipient or participants average

262
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
confidence rating in using this feature

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
was 4.2 out of 5. our participants had a

264
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
high understanding of the sms passcode

265
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
feature most of them understood how this

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
feature works but half of them did not

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
use it for usability reasons next we

268
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
looked at the pre-expiry access

269
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
revocation feature only one out of the

270
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,240
19 participants used this feature when

271
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,000
they thought that the recipient might

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,839
not read their email the remaining

273
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
participants did not use this feature

274
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,480
because they trusted the recipients or

275
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
they deemed it unnecessary as setting

276
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
the expiration time on email was enough

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
other reasons included in fact that

278
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,079
email content was not super sensitive or

279
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
the participants were unaware that this

280
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
feature existed or they did not know how

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
to use it therefore our participants had

282
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
a relatively low understanding of

283
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
pre-expiry access revocation feature the

284
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
last feature is permission restriction

285
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
so the gmail's confidential mode

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,839
prevents the recipient from forwarding

287
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
copying printing or downloading email

288
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
content and attachments we asked our

289
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,160
participants about their experiences

290
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
with preventing recipients from

291
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
forwarding downloading printing their

292
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,200
gcm emails so 14 out of the 19

293
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,680
participants stated that gcm prevents

294
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
recipients from downloading forwarding

295
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
copying or printing email attachments by

296
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,279
default some participants also stated

297
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
alternative methods for copying email

298
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
contents while using this mode these

299
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,680
include screenshots taken from the

300
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,519
computer or smartphone screen

301
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
third-party programs to bypass security

302
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
and other screen recording tools our

303
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
participants average confidence rating

304
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
in using this feature was 3.7 out of 5.

305
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
so our participants had a moderate

306
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
understanding of the permission

307
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
restriction feature a few of them did

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
not know how the permission restriction

309
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,519
feature works but majority used it since

310
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,160
it is provided by default to conclude in

311
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
this paper we performed a qualitative

312
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
study on 19 gmail users to understand

313
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
their perceptions of gmail confidential

314
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
mode which was introduced in 2018. we

315
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
found that users used this mode to share

316
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
their confidential private documents

317
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,800
users perceived this mode to be

318
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,440
encrypted and confidential the most used

319
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
feature of this mode was the default

320
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
expiration time of one week and the

321
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
least used feature was the pre-expiry

322
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
access revocation thank you for your

323
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,480
attention

324
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
and i'm happy to answer any questions

325
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,120
you may have
