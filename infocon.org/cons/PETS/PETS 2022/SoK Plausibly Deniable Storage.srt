1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,879
good morning and welcome uh my name is

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,359
rod dusan i'm a professor in stony brook

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
uh this is joint work uh and actually

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
primarily the work of my students chen

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,160
chen

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,240
and xiao liang has also contributed uh

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,599
bogdan corbin is one of our

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,880
collaborators he's in florida

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
international university

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,240
um so in today's talk this is this is an

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,640
sok paper and it refers to this thing

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,119
called plasma ability and the problem

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,439
i'm facing with this is that it's just

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,680
not easy to describe the whole that's

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,679
okay a whole is okay paper in in 12

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,720
minutes

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,200
so my goal today would i would be happy

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,360
if we all go home understanding a little

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
more about plausibility ability and some

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
of the challenges that are faced here

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
i'm not going to use too many greek

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,399
letters here and i'm not going to talk

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,079
about proofs or security models or other

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,399
things just not enough time to do that

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
i'm just gonna try to focus on you know

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
getting you the essentials uh to to get

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
a little bit of info on this field

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
so let's see what's going on here so

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,239
what's the problem why do we need this

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,000
new thing what is this new thing well

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
the problem is this right you have

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,800
encryption

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,240
and use encryption for data privacy and

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
and the problem that happens right now

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
is that increasingly governments realize

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
that encryption is very very powerful as

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
a tool in protecting yourself and so

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
then there's increasing anti-encryption

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
laws in addition to oppressive

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
governments you see this in in western

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,920
governments like the uk government the

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,880
australian government the uh there's

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
hundreds and hundreds of examples where

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
courts have compelled disclosure and and

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,280
laws are enacted that are supposed to uh

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,799
you know protect the children but at the

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
end of the day weaken

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,400
significantly the uh the

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
infrastructure the backbone of privacy

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,119
uh uh techniques and tools such as

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,240
encryption

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
and so now the problem is uh what are

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
you is is there something you can do

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
about this

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
and plosive reliability aims to provide

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
an answer to that and the general idea

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,960
here would be uh that

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
you know when people try when people

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
have coercive power over you so let's

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
imagine you have a device here and on

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
this device you have some data so here's

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199
your data and this this data is

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
encrypted with some key right and so

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
what happens is somebody can coerce you

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,640
to provide this key uh so here's your

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,800
your oppressive government or your bad

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
guy and and

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
now you you're being asked for this key

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
and so you have to provide this key k

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
right and so the general idea behind

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,640
plausibility would be to build a

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
mechanism that allows you to still

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,519
uh respond to such rubber hose attacks

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,959
gracefully and

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
yes disclose key k and so on and

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
potentially you know potentially

77
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,440
fighting it a little bit and so on but

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
at the end of the day also allow

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
yourself to additionally uh

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,440
hide uh additional information i'm

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
talking about plus my ability for

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,200
storage deployed my ability has a bigger

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
story that has to do with with plausibly

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,280
denying actions or interactions or other

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
things i'm talking about storage right

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
now so you're going to have the ability

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,120
to also have some hidden data here

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
hidden data

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,040
and you're going to be able to somehow

90
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
store this hidden data on the same

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
device

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,040
and

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,959
while still being able to plausibly deny

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
that you actually have this hidden data

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
and so now uh and usually what you're

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
going to do is you're going to encrypt

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
this hidden data with another key with a

98
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
different key that you're not going to

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
you're not going to reveal to the to the

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,400
bad guy

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,159
and so basically what you're trying to

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,040
achieve here is the ability to still get

103
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
privacy guarantees potentially through

104
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
encryption somehow while at the same

105
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
time being able to be responsive to

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,000
rubber hose slash coercive attacks

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
that's the general idea of plasma

108
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,760
ability in the context of storage

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
and and the problem we're facing with so

110
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
and there's a bunch of challenges here

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
that are gonna that that are we're gonna

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
have to deal with so what let's look a

113
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
little bit at the adversary so what can

114
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
the adversary do if you want to build

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
systems like this uh you have to think

116
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
of the adversary obviously so obviously

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
the adversary knows the damage system

118
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,720
all right so we're not doing secure web

119
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
security uh the adversary can access the

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
device

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
and this is a key point once or multiple

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
times and we'll see where that becomes

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,639
important the adversity can coerce this

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
closure of secrets we already discussed

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,880
that

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
the adversity can question the very

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
reason for using the uh the the

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
plausibly deniable capable system and

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
this is a problem we'll see how

130
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
we actually we're not going to see this

131
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,600
but this is one of the things we

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,919
discussed in this case how can we uh

133
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,880
deny how can we provide a reason for

134
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
using the actual pd system why are using

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
the system that also provides political

136
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
ability you're suspect you can't

137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,840
convince me that you're not having

138
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
hidden data using the system asp.net oh

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
well my system also allows me to encrypt

140
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,320
data okay great but is that enough and

141
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
can you do better than that

142
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
and then uh but the adversary is assumed

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
reasonably so to be computationally

144
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
bounded obviously to be rational this is

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,199
an important one meaning that okay if

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,360
the adversary cannot prove the existence

147
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
of unrevealed data

148
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
or if you sufficiently convince the

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
adversary that there's plausible reasons

150
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
for for for using this device and for

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,280
responding to to a rubber hose attack

152
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
there's no further coercion so this

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,280
rationality will play out differently in

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
different scenarios

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,520
um

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
and then very often the adversary is

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,680
assumed not to have access to runtime

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
system state because otherwise uh you're

159
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
you're building you're fighting against

160
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,800
against god and you can't fight against

161
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
god so the adversary can be there on

162
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
your shoulder 24 7 looking at everything

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
that you do

164
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,880
it's going to be very difficult to build

165
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
any system where you can still hide

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
information and use that information

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,759
meaningfully while the adversity sits on

168
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
your shoulder even though in certain

169
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,000
cases that's possible so so these are

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
some of the important

171
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,039
uh uh

172
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,960
some of the important things that the

173
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
adversary that you have to consider when

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
you're looking at adversary in this

175
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,479
context and so now let's see what people

176
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,160
came up with so i'm going to show you a

177
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,240
thing that's called truecrypt you i

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
suspect most of you guys may be familiar

179
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
with truecrypt or many of you are if not

180
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
here it is as a 10 second summary on

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
truecrypt so truecrypt is one of these

182
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
systems is very cool it disappeared now

183
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
basically uh there's a bunch of uh uh

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,039
forks of it uh the the original team

185
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,280
disappeared under a very suspicious

186
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
circumstances i mean they disappeared

187
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,479
but they stopped working on it and the

188
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,000
idea of a trick group is this right you

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,479
have some device this is your your disk

190
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,000
and on this disk you have a bunch of

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
volumes these are your your public

192
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,520
volumes

193
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
uh public volume

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
uh another public volume

195
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
um and

196
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,319
and and when you're being coerced by the

197
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,560
by the by the bad guy you can provide

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
these things are encrypted obviously you

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
kind of provide

200
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
some encryption keys that you use for

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
these uh public volumes so so there's

202
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
some encryption here and there's some

203
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,199
more encryption here

204
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,199
with the other key right and that's all

205
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
fine and then so you can respond to a

206
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
coercive attack and then however

207
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,000
crucially what truecrypt does is says

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
hey look at all this free space here uh

209
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
why don't we store something in this

210
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
free space why don't we hide a volume

211
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,880
here

212
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
uh this is going to be something like an

213
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,000
encryption with some hidden uh and and

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,599
randomized so i'm going to have a random

215
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,840
number there and my data so this is

216
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,639
going to be the the the randomized

217
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,400
volume that i'm storing here and i'm not

218
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
gonna provide this key to to the bad guy

219
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
so this is what truecrypt does the

220
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
problem obvious problem with this and

221
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
many problems but one of the obvious

222
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,639
problems is wait a second if the bad guy

223
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
can see my device multiple times we

224
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,680
discuss that this is one of the things

225
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,199
the adversary can do

226
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
it may see that this region here is

227
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,240
supposed to be three has changed despite

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
uh the fact that there's no changes in

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
the public volumes at all and so that

230
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
alone will reveal the fact that there's

231
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,240
something hidden here so truecrypt does

232
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
not survive

233
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
uh truecrypt survived a thing called a

234
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,319
single snapshot single snapshot

235
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
adversary

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,960
but does not survive a multi-snapshot

237
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,039
multi-snapshot adversary right

238
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
and so there's been a lot of work

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,840
in people building systems for

240
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
multi-snapshot adversaries and so so now

241
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
this brings us to some of the challenges

242
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
that have to do with plasma and ability

243
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,520
right so here's a couple of the

244
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
challenges uh security efficiency

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,240
trade-offs exist all over the place uh

246
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
in anything you build in security

247
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
obviously but in this case specifically

248
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,760
one of the main trade-offs has to do

249
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
with single snapshot versus

250
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
multi-snapshot single snapshots are

251
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,479
usually fast

252
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,880
but your security is not very good

253
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
again why is this important well because

254
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
you cross the border three times the

255
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
adversary can see your device three

256
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,519
times or you leave your device in the

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,800
hotel room

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
it is encrypted so the adversity cannot

259
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
see the data but it could start breaking

260
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,600
your placement deniability mechanisms if

261
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
you'd want to do multi-snapshot you get

262
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
better security but you're much slower

263
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
you either rely on right-only orm as

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
you'll see in the paper or you have to

265
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
make all kinds of assumptions or relax

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
security requirements and that's that's

267
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,200
not uh as good

268
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
then you have a dependency on system

269
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
layers most of the

270
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
most of the existing work out there

271
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
builds flows my ability in some layer

272
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
out there oh this is my file system it's

273
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
it's possible great but then they the

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
the assumptions are that the underlying

275
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
sys the underlying layers behave

276
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,880
properly and

277
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
uh in in a way that supports this and

278
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
that's very rarely the case the typical

279
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
example is an ssd if you have uh you

280
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
build a software block device on top of

281
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,839
it or or you build a file system on top

282
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:42,560
of

283
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,880
some block device on top of an ssd and

284
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
then you assume that the ssd for example

285
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,440
honors an erase you say hey delete this

286
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
block why because later you want to

287
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,279
guarantee that the snapshot does not

288
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,720
include that block in that form or

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
whatever and you're assuming ssd will do

290
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
that for you but unfortunately as you

291
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
know because we're leveling a million of

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,240
things the ssd does not do that for you

293
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,000
and in fact it may keep that data lying

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
around so if you open up the ssd and

295
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
start reading eprom chips you can start

296
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,279
seeing all your transcripts and

297
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,800
everything else you wrote before

298
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
effectively breaking anything you've

299
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
done at this upper layer so you have to

300
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,399
be aware of this multi-systems layer

301
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
story and solve it you can't just say

302
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
i'm going to give you a plus an enable

303
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
file system when the underlying block

304
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
device will keep traces of everything

305
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,959
you've ever written

306
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
so you can't do that and we have to

307
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
solve that and we show

308
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
directions and ideas on how to solve

309
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,839
that and we're providing a general story

310
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
for that uh in in the paper and then

311
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
there's a lack of unified security

312
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
framework what that means is everybody

313
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,040
and their grandmother comes up with some

314
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
new ways of defining how secure their

315
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
stuff is which is usually what happens

316
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
in our community and and the problem is

317
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
it's very hard to compare things both

318
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
from a security point of view and also

319
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,360
from efficiency point of view because

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
mind you when you pay a lot for security

321
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,240
uh in security for a performance

322
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,279
trade-off you're going to get a very

323
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,720
efficient system

324
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
but it's going to have security and

325
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
vice versa

326
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
so here are some of the contributions of

327
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
the slk paper and again we don't have

328
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,240
time to dive deep but we're happy to you

329
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560
know please do read the paper and if you

330
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
if you're thinking of building plasma

331
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
ability using an existing system into

332
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
something that you build in a broader

333
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
system or you want to build your own

334
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
plot-deniable system you have some ideas

335
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
don't be shy please reach out so some

336
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
contributions have to do with we're

337
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,519
addressing the pencil system layers so

338
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
in this sok period we're not only

339
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
summarizing what happens out there but

340
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,480
we're also saying

341
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
uh can you address this dependency and

342
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
we're providing this trace-oriented

343
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
security

344
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,600
which basically says

345
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
you have to look at the full transcript

346
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
throughout all the layers

347
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,920
anything that ever moves on this device

348
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
has to be part of the trace

349
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
and based on that trace you define what

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
trace oriented security defined security

351
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
game that defines what security means

352
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,639
here it's a meaningful security game

353
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
that actually can you can use to prove

354
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,680
things and disprove things about

355
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
existing system but we we show that it

356
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
comes at the price equivalence to wrm

357
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,720
very slow we address the lack of unified

358
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
security framework so we build a unified

359
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
security framework that has flexibility

360
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
to capture a lot of stuff existing stuff

361
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
and new stuff and allows you to compare

362
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,160
things we provide you additional

363
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
insights how to achieve what is called

364
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
invisibility uh how to

365
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
hide data uh how to hide access patterns

366
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
to hidden data and also what other

367
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,680
future directions uh some people are

368
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,399
working on uh or you may want to work on

369
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,320
uh this is basically it i'm i'm at the

370
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
end of my 12 minutes if you want to

371
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
reach out please reach out to rgxr.io

372
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,320
or some any of

373
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,560
us you can you also have the full

374
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
version of the paper which is larger

375
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
online thank you very much and hope you

376
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
got something out of this
