i'm a phd student and member of sec lab

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
at the ohio state university advised by

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,840
professor ji chiang lin

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,200
i'm grateful and honored to present our

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
research to you all today titled replay

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,679
far away exploiting and fixing google

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,680
apple exposure notification contact

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
i'd like to thank my co-authors

anish aurora also thank you to the pets

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
chairs and organizers for this year's

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,960
symposium

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
in this presentation i'll be introducing

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,480
our enhancement to the google apple

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
exposure notification framework which

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
adds geospatial awareness to defend

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
against geographically distributed

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,600
crowdsourced replay attacks

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,360
so first a bit of background on contact

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,640
tracing and motivation for our research

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
digital contact tracing aims to be a

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
scalable solution beyond manual human

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
contact tracing it is often implemented

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
as applications for smartphones that

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,680
leverage both new and existing protocols

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,039
the three high-level functions of

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
contact tracing aim to determine

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,119
encounters with others whether or not it

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
is epidemiologically significant and to

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,520
communicate the encounter particularly

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
if someone tests positive

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,119
these functions can be effectively

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,720
characterized by centralized or

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
decentralized approaches though most are

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,720
some sort of hybrid that balance a

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
trade-off between data utility and data

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
privacy

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
and now to briefly introduce google

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
apple exposure notification framework or

44
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,479
gain

45
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,560
gain is a joint effort between google

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
and apple that is heavily based on dp3t

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,360
one of the many protocols introduced

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
relatively early on in the kovin 19

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
pandemic

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
this is a largely decentralized protocol

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
in the sense that it is effectively

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
using bluetooth low energy beacons to

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,799
determine encounters

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,399
algorithms at the edge or on the

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,880
smartphone to determine significance and

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
effectively a bent pipe public health

57
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
authority server to distribute anonymous

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479
data

59
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
it is open source with reference

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
implementations available on github

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
effectively approved public health

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
authorities must develop apps that

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
utilize the exposure notification

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,318
software development kit to take

65
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,318
advantage of lower level operating

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
system functionality

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
the high level concept of gain is as

68
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,520
follows

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
smartphones generate daily suit or

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
random keys known as temporary exposure

71
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
keys or teks then roughly every 10

72
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
minutes drive an ephemeral token to

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,040
broadcast known as a rolling proximity

74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
identifier or rpi

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
these rpis are then broadcasted and

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
captured over bluetooth low energy

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
upon a positive diagnosis users can

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
elect to anonymously upload their

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
pseudo-random keys to a public health

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
authority server

81
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,239
other users smartphones will

82
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,920
periodically receive these anonymous

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,480
keys and use them to derive tokens to

84
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
match with those they've already

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,720
captured

86
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
if there's a match and it meets an

87
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
encounter threshold with time in rssi

88
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
the user is notified of a potential

89
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
exposure

90
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,159
here's a look at the typical gain

91
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,319
scenario at 1 alice broadcaster rpis

92
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,280
nearby and within ble range at 2 bob

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
captures and stores them

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
out of range at 3 charlie does not

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
unfortunately alice is later diagnosed

96
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,959
positive and elects to send her

97
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
anonymous te cas to the public health

98
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
authority server

99
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,760
these keys are combined with other

100
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,159
positive case keys and periodically

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
distributed to all subscribers including

102
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,319
bob and charlie

103
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,599
both bomb and charlie's phone will

104
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
derive rpis from the teks but only bobs

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
will determine a match with an rpi

106
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
captured from alice prompting a

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,959
notification

108
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,400
whereas charlie will not match because

109
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,720
she never captured alice's rpi to begin

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,280
with not ever being within ble range

111
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
the existing gain framework is

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
vulnerable to replay attacks because it

113
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
only considers time for rpi validity and

114
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,280
therefore lacks geospatial awareness of

115
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,560
where the rpi was actually captured

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,360
as such and as an example an rpi is

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
equally valid in columbus ohio as it is

118
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
in brooklyn new york hundreds of miles

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
away

120
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
this is illustrating the following

121
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
workflow where in columbus ohio at the

122
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,000
ohio state university library alice once

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
again broadcasts her rpi but now both

124
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,799
nearby bob and malicious actor mallory

125
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
capture it

126
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,399
mallory transmits the rpi to a replay

127
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
attack server which then immediately

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
distributes it to other malicious actors

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
such as malachi in brooklyn new york

130
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,080
malachi broadcast the rpi at a hip local

131
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
coffee shop and nearby charlie captures

132
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,800
it

133
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
when alice is later positively diagnosed

134
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,040
and likes to upload her tek

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
bob will rightfully match an rpi but so

136
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
will charlie even though she was never

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
near alice

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
with an introductory background we can

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
now move on to our research and

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
contribution

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,919
the geographically distributed replay

142
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
attack and other related works motivated

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,080
three distinct research goals in the

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
development of our solution gain plus

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
the first to retrieve user locations

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,160
without compromising user privacy

147
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
then use this data to enhance gain with

148
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,880
geospatial awareness to defend against

149
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,960
the distributed replay attack

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
and finally to incorporate these

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
enhancements with minimal rework and to

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
preserve the essence of the protocol

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
otherwise we'd really just be creating a

154
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
whole new solution

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,199
we accomplished our first goal by

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
utilizing wi-fi and cellular positioning

157
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,199
that are provided by course location

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
services on smartphones

159
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
this offers significantly reduced power

160
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
consumption over a more precise gps

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
query

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
and further it does not violate gains

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
additional terms that prohibits using

164
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,000
precise locations

165
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
the second goal is achieved through the

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
use of hierarchical geospatial indexes

167
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,400
which effectively provide a grid overlay

168
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
for the entire earth rather than use

169
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,800
political boundaries like city state or

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,440
county lines a grid overlay provides an

171
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,759
agnostic uniform and efficient way to

172
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,600
determine location

173
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
fortunately there are many open source

174
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,360
solutions already available with

175
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,199
trade-offs and various approaches to

176
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
defining the parent child hierarchical

177
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,479
structure

178
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,800
on the left we have geohash which uses z

179
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
curves in the middle google's own s2

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
library using geodesic squares and

181
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,280
uber's h3 library using hexagons on the

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
right

183
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
each are shown here with some parent

184
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
level or resolution n

185
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,319
in solved in lines and resolution n plus

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,240
one in dashes

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,199
we chose h3 for its more uniform overlay

188
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,880
in the reduction in neighboring cell

189
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
calculations which i'll return to

190
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
shortly

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
and finally our third goal enhances gain

192
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
with minimal rework and leaves the

193
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,199
algorithms largely intact i introduced

194
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,440
teks and rpis earlier

195
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
but there is a third key that is derived

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,080
between these two called the rpi k or

197
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
rolling proximity identifier key the

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
rpik

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
is the 16 byte result of an hmac based

200
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,919
key derivation function or hkdf which

201
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,800
takes the daily tek in some null bytes

202
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
in a constant string

203
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
the null bytes provide a natural place

204
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,240
for the location index provided by h3

205
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
further when a user captures a nearby

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,639
rpi the h3 library is queried for a

207
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
location index and securely stored to

208
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,039
later used to derive and match rpis

209
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
this modification is perhaps more

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
clearly illustrated here where we can

211
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
see the new location-based rpik

212
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,479
derivation provides location context

213
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,960
with bi-layer in direction

214
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,720
in other words both the tek and rpi are

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
generated and transmitted as before with

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,520
the original gain framework however

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
neither contained complete information

218
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
to derive location

219
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
we implemented game plus on android

220
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
using the reference source code on

221
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
github provided by google effectively we

222
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
enable course locations include the h3c

223
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,080
library and use the h3 index as the salt

224
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,520
value to derive the rpi case for both

225
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
rpi generation and matching

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
and now for our evaluation of our

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
prototype

228
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
we measured the effectiveness

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
against geographically distributed

230
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
replay attacks in this experiment we

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
created nine user activity and user

232
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
density profile combinations here we are

233
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
looking at densities of 100 200 and 400

234
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
users who elect to upload their teks

235
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
upon a positive diagnosis

236
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
resulting in over two hundred thousand

237
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
four hundred thousand and eight hundred

238
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,839
thousand rpi's generated and broadcasted

239
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
over fourteen days respectively

240
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
they are randomly placed throughout 50

241
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
locations then we model a victim user

242
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,080
with a low activity profile who visits

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
five out of the 50 locations throughout

244
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,720
this period but captures three percent

245
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
of the total total rpis broadcasted

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,080
we observe that gain inaccurately

247
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,880
matches 100 percent of the captured rpis

248
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
even though the victim user only visited

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
5 out of the 50 or 10 of the locations

250
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
also that gain plus accurately matches

251
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
approximately 10 percent

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
this difference effectively gives a

253
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,519
false positive rate of the original gain

254
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
showing approximately 90 rpis matched

255
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,560
from locations the victim user had not

256
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
actually been present

257
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
next we evaluate the impact of the

258
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
resolution parameter using our

259
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
non-uniform distribution location data

260
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
set starting on the left we can see

261
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,399
brooklyn new york is almost entirely

262
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,560
captured in a single cell at resolution

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,839
4. at resolution 6 we now see about six

264
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,080
cells and then even more at resolution

265
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
seven

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
we now use a medium user in medium

267
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
activity profile that generates over

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
four hundred thousand rpis again with a

269
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
victim user capturing three percent at

270
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
resolution four through six game plus

271
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
performs like gain because the

272
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,959
resolution produces relatively large

273
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,399
cells for this particular movement

274
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,440
profile

275
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,760
at resolutions 10 11 we observe the

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,360
number of matched rpis converges to 1

277
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,959
454 as well as the number of cells

278
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
required to contain all potential

279
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,959
visited locations and the time required

280
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
for matching computation while this

281
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
represents approximately 12 percent of

282
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,320
the roughly 12 000 rpis captured we note

283
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
again the non-uniformity of our brooklyn

284
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,640
new york data set

285
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
we then evaluated game plus for its

286
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
power consumption on the left we

287
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,399
evaluated rpi derivation updating

288
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
location every 60 seconds for two hours

289
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
and see the difference throughout is

290
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,279
roughly one percent in middle

291
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
throughout 10 minutes of rpi matching

292
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
gain plus is again within one percent of

293
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,519
gain and actually performs better likely

294
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,920
due to the original gain making more jni

295
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,040
calls

296
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,760
on the right we see for an equal size

297
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
set of tdks gain plus continues matching

298
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
as expected requiring approximately nine

299
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
percent more battery

300
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,279
we compared gain cluster related works

301
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
and observe it hits the marks for adding

302
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,920
a location context without modifying or

303
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
directly including location in the

304
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
payload and without additional

305
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
third-party apps for infrastructure or

306
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
uploads to the public health authority

307
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
server

308
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
we'll now close with discussion and

309
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
future work

310
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,560
opportunities we utilize the

311
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,200
hierarchical characteristic of h3 to

312
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
handle the case where two individuals

313
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
are near each other across cell

314
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
boundaries and for any fuzziness and

315
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,120
course location we use a resolution r to

316
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,160
provide location context for the lrpik

317
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,959
but we use resolution r plus 1 to store

318
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
location for later rpi matching when it

319
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,880
comes time to match rpis for each r plus

320
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
1 location in blue we retrieve

321
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,279
neighboring cells and check its parent

322
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
if it's the same parent continue

323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
if it's different add the parent to the

324
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
set of additional location cells to use

325
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
for rpi derivation this reduces the

326
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,519
total number of neighboring cells in the

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,200
naive approach from 6 down to 2 or 0 in

328
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
the case you're located in the center of

329
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
a cell

330
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,639
we observe that game plus is effective

331
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
at defending against geographically

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,639
distributed replay attacks rpis can

333
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,240
still be replayed within the same cell

334
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
they are captured

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
the resolution can be tuned however with

336
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,880
performance trade-offs

337
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
we also observed location precision is

338
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,440
different across platforms as a solution

339
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
google and apple can you provide a

340
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,680
uniform option accessible only got by

341
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
game plus

342
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
and finally an opportunity for future

343
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
research for dynamic resolutions that

344
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,440
adapt to user densities

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
thank you again for the opportunity to

346
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,519
present our research
