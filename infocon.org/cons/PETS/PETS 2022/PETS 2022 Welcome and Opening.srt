you are probably

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
waking up super early anyway because of

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
the jet lag which is convenient maybe

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
for some

78
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
but i'll tell you about about the you

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
uh 307 registered participants

175
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,840
that's i think a record number for pets

176
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,039
this year

177
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,479
which is kind of really interesting

178
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,479
because it's split about half half right

179
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
about 140ish

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,720
online registrations and and the rest of

181
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
in-person registrations

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
and we're really represented across the

183
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,319
six different continents actually we

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,160
have people from asia of course in

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
australia

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
us

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,319
both

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,280
well

189
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
the south america as well in north

190
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,880
america

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
and europe of course but we also have

192
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
some

193
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,599
attendees from africa which is great

194
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,400
um

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
we do have the saturday hike as well

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,680
many of you have been asking about that

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
we are kind of sold out on that so we

198
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
have 49

199
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
register our participants we are trying

200
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,160
to get secure more seats

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
um i think we'll try to make a little

202
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,199
announcement

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
today or um the latest tomorrow morning

204
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
trying to grab a few more seats for many

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,520
of you who expressed interest in joining

206
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,319
the

207
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,280
the the pets hike

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,919
um

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
all right so i mentioned a couple of

210
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
times that we're running this hybrid

211
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,880
format

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,479
um and i like to think about it as a

213
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
hybrid in in both in in space and in

214
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
time really so

215
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
in space that's kind of obvious we're

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
really trying to

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
for the first time at pets connect both

218
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
the physical world to the to the virtual

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,639
world and that's gather town that we

220
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
used last year

221
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,400
so we'll try as much as possible to

222
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
really

223
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,400
um you know provide that

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,240
not real life experience to you know

225
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
people joining on the other town but we

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
really try our best and of course we

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
will have speakers um and participants

228
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
asking questions on gather tone

229
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,879
um so we'll you know the idea is really

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
to connect the the different rooms the

231
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,560
different physical rooms to the to the

232
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
gather tone and vice versa

233
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,240
now the other sort of you know um

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
difference compared to previous years

235
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,039
what we're trying to do here is

236
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,919
kind of split the day um

237
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,599
you know as two halves which are kind of

238
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,000
reasonably well aligned time wise for

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
other you know time zones in europe and

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,960
us

241
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
so we're starting very early and then we

242
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
have a really

243
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
you know comfortable lunch break um that

244
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,799
we're calling it

245
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,440
the lunch break plus explore sydney i'll

246
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,599
talk a little bit about it in a minute

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
um and those late late afternoon

248
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,080
sessions are really kind of european

249
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
time zones friendly somehow so you know

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
folks waking up

251
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
and uh and probably being able to catch

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
uh some of the talks in live talks in

253
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,360
you know without necessarily having to

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
wake up at 3am and so on

255
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
and the early mornings for us i really

256
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
aim to you know um offer a better

257
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
experience to our north and south

258
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,640
american

259
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,399
online

260
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
attendees and friends with with again

261
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
some reasonable times to join the talks

262
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
in case um you know

263
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
we still or even here actually people do

264
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,399
not or miss some of these talks we do

265
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,000
have catch-up sessions on the gather

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,959
town

267
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
so watch out for those uh catch-up rooms

268
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320
on the on the gather town platform

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
now because we're running this hybrid

270
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
format

271
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,480
there's a few things that i think are

272
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
really important and i'm sure that you

273
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
know many people don't read emails

274
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
because they were long emails

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
um i give it to florian we don't read

276
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,240
long emails

277
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
but we do have really important

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
instructions in those emails about how

279
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
to connect together town and how even

280
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,839
people who are in person in person

281
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
participants or in-person speakers in

282
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
particular who are interested in using

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
their own devices their own laptops for

284
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
presentations they need to to take extra

285
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
steps so that they connect to the gather

286
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
tone so that's basically for instance

287
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
moving your avatar

288
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
even if you're sitting here and talking

289
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
here in the gather town platform

290
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
um just that you you connect

291
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
um with with people and you know people

292
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
on online could hear you and could see

293
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
you

294
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
and of course you know for our online

295
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,839
participants

296
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
the question session is obviously going

297
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
to be managed and

298
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
hopefully nicely supervised by the

299
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
session chairs and we'll ask people from

300
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,839
online get a town platform to

301
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
jump onto that question area you know

302
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,320
the the green carpets out there in all

303
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,839
the different rooms

304
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,760
um a line up there waiting for

305
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,519
instructions from the session chairs to

306
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
you know instruct them to to ask that

307
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
question

308
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,200
all right so that that lunch plus

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
explore sydney part of it

310
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
um and i know that many people have

311
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,440
already started exploring sydney in many

312
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
different ways

313
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,959
um so we do have those long lunch time

314
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,240
breaks

315
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
you know typically it's between the 12

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
noon to to the 3pm

317
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
i've got a couple of suggestions for you

318
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,120
there

319
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
you know you could very well explore the

320
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
botanic gardens they're wonderful you

321
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
can make a little

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
walk around the harbour that's one of my

323
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,839
favorites

324
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,920
and the weather is cooperative i think

325
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,200
which is good

326
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
um hyde park is

327
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
you know very short walk from here

328
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,880
there's really the

329
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
museum there not too far um the science

330
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
museum

331
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
the rocks is about 30 minutes walk where

332
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
you can actually catch a light rail

333
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
there and have a drink or two

334
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
maybe not two you really have to come

335
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,399
back to the sessions

336
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,279
um but yeah um you could enjoy walk on

337
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,040
on the circular key and you know darling

338
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
harbor is not too far as well so it's

339
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,000
pretty really

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
central to uh too many different um

341
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,639
touristic not so touristic actually many

342
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,240
of these places are really lovely and

343
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
like you'll find lots of locals there

344
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,639
um if you're feeling like more into the

345
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,279
mood of arts and culture there's a bunch

346
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,760
of museums not too far as well

347
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
contemporary art museum is one of my

348
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
favorites

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
um the art galleries also at circular

350
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
key just just um you know feel free to

351
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
uh

352
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,600
to drop by there um if you're feeling a

353
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,079
little geeky and nerd which is probably

354
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,880
98 of the audience here there's the

355
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,399
powerhouse museum which is just two

356
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
minutes away from from this spot from

357
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
uts campus

358
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
don't mention to anyone else that i i

359
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
referred to catching a ferry to manly

360
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
and see the

361
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,920
resident penguins there

362
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
but you could do that it's just a one

363
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
hour and 10 minutes maybe one hour and

364
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
20 minutes sort of returned very by by

365
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
catching it very terribly

366
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
um but yeah

367
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,519
i never said that

368
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,760
um

369
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,519
affinity sessions and unconference

371
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519

372
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
discussions groups special interest

373
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160

technical and non-technical sessions as

409
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,880

410
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,160
and this year we're especially

411
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,680
interested in hosting affinity groups

412
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,079
for women and pets and a bypass in pets

413
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,959
we do have on the gather town

414
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,079
special

415
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,000
rooms for that of course as i said we

416
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
will be connecting the different rooms

417
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
to the gather town but we also

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
have the safe spaces

419
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
room and i think florian later will tell

420
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
you a little bit about the code of

421
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,839
conduct of pets

422
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
so please pay attention to these rooms

423
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040

424
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
they are available

425
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,199
very quickly um

426
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,279
i think we have much clearer skies this

427
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
this this week which is really

428
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,079
um good we will

429
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,440
tell you a little bit about how stressed

430
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
the organization committee was

431
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,880
about that that rainy sort of week we

432
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
had

433
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
um

434
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,959
many people reached out saying you know

435
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
how about the floods and the flooding

436
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
and all of that we were very safe here

437
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
but um you know coming today um with the

438
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
uber driver he was telling me that you

439
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,320
know

440
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,839
some areas in

441
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
new south wales the original air is

442
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
close to the rivers and you know god

443
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
knows that we do have plenty of rivers

444
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
in new south wales it was actually

445
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,199
pretty pretty serious stuff there

446
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,160
um

447
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
extreme weather i think it's been been

448
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,800
hitting uh this this part of the world

449
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,680
for

450
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
for different reasons that you can you

451
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
can probably explain

452
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
um but yeah we're we're

453
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,560

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,760
a round of applause and and florian is

687
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,740
here today

688
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,159
[Applause]

689
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,159
and that's going to be my very last

690
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
slide um

691
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,919
i think by now you figured this out it's

692
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,200
probably everywhere but uh the wi-fi is

693
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
that if you don't have a jerome if you

694
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
do have a jerome that's even better

695
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,919
and the password is that and i can't

696
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,240
believe that this tool i was trying was

697
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,679
giving this password the 47

698
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,240
security score i don't know gosh someone

699
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,720
has to do really proper research on that

700
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,559
oh hang on they've done it

701

thanks to all of those again i will not

744
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,400
ask for another round of applause but we

745
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
should all think about it

746
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,279
now

747
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,760
um

748
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,640
as

749
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
mentioned there is a code of contact you

750
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,039
find it on the web page

751
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,600
basically be open and respective to

752
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,640
everyone

753
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,440
um

754
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,080
and if there is anything that you

755
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,679
believe uh

756
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,400
that needs action uh andrei maybe you

757
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,640
raise a hand yes he's acting as our safe

758
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,320
spaces contact person for the event and

759
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,080
online you said there is some rooms

760
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
where people can go to maybe you want to

761
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
put your avatar also at some point of

762
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
time

763
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,840
in these places

764
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
right

765
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,200
a lot of people might if they have not

766
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
read the web page ask about the

767
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,720
statistics

768
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,679
so all together we had

769
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,159
more than 2 000 authors

770
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,600
we had more than 500 submissions

771
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,360
which again is a 23 percent increase it

772
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,279
is not as huge as the increase in

773
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,760
2021 but is still continuously growing

774
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,279
and sufficiently painful for reviewers

775
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,720
and

776
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
pc chairs and senior pc members alike

777
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
and

778
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,440
with now

779
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,320
other conferences picking up on the fact

780
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
that you need more reviewers

781
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,720
and gets even harder and harder for pets

782
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,830
so

783
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,880
[Music]

784
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
i don't know what to do about this

785
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,120
but it's a challenge i can tell you

786
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,799
we had a 24 acceptance rate 128 papers

787
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,279
presented over the next three days

788
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
uh i would like to really thank you the

789
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,960
the the pc uh 29 senior pc members 164

790
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,640
uh pc members regular pc members 148

791
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
external reviewers

792
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,440
made altogether more than 2 200 reviews

793
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,760
and posted more than 5 700 comments

794
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
okay you see the effort that goes into

795
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
deciding

796
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
these papers

797
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
and

798
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,440
you will see the numbers per issue here

799
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
again you see an increasing trend it

800
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,559
keeps growing pretty much every time

801
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,559
unfortunately it's not as exponential it

802
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,399
seems the last one is the total column

803
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,039
so so don't be too scared

804
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,720
but the numbers are

805
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
increasing

806
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,080
and

807
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
we actually have

808
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
a

809
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,039
a process where by now a majority of

810
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,080
papers

811
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,640
sees a major revision so the numbers of

812
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,120
accepted papers in in future issues will

813
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
go up as well

814
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,520
um

815
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
the next session is actually also

816
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,960
already our

817
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
keynote uh i believe that most people in

818
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
the security community will know moti

819
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,760
for a very long time

820
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,799
i'm very happy that he was willing to

821
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
join us for the keynote

822
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,200
uh he's unfortunately not here in person

823
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
because he was traveling

824
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,840
until

825
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,919
uh before the weekend and and couldn't

826
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,080
make it

827
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,000
to australia anymore um but he will uh

828
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,440
if you know moti

829
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
he has brought many cryptographic

830
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,720
techniques for into the privacy world

831
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,520
and he will give us a talk of how some

832
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
other technologies uh that he has

833
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,559
recently

834
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
brought into practical use

835
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,799
um

836
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,000
the

837
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,919
town hall is already mentioned we'll go

838
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,840
about the state of pets we will

839
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,959
introduce uh

840
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,080
what we did i made last last year i made

841
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,600
a few announcements of things that we

842
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
changed

843
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,760
and i want to tell the community how it

844
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,000
went and want to see your feedback of

845
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,679
how you think i did this wrong

846
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,679
and um

847
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,080
see what changes the new pc chairs

848
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,080
should do to make it right again
