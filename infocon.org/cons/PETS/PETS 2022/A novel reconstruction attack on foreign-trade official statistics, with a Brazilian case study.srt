1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,319
hello everyone my name is danilo favato

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,640
and i'm a researcher from universidad de

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,440
federal de menageries brazil

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,679
today i'll be presenting a database

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,920
restriction attack

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
that i've demonstrated to be effective

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
in re-identifying porters when it's

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
conducted against brazilian foreign

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,199
trade statistics

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,119
although my demonstration scope was

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,160
limited

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
i think the workflow all laid down here

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,679
can be applied to all the countries and

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
data sets

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
my explanation will be divided into

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,079
three phases

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,239
first i'll assume the data publisher

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,600
role and there goes restrictions and

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
choices for publishing their foreign

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
traded statistics

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,800
next i'll take the adversaries role and

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
explain the algorithm used

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
lastly i'll report my findings for the

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,199
real case that i have investigated

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
so let's start by pretending i'm the

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,319
brazilian tax and customs administration

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,280
and one of my jobs is to inspect foreign

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
trade transactions for tax collection

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
purposes

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,080
during this process importers

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
will be entering into my system

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
their import declarations

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
these important

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,759
declarations are like invoices here you

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,040
can see the australian example

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
they have all the transactions data such

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
as the importer exporter value weight

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
what was imported tax paid part of

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
entrance country of origin and so forth

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,119
periodically i the tax and custis and

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
administration government

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
i'm required to publish some data to

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,079
fulfill some public interests while also

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,880
respecting privacy requirements

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
on the public utility side the disclosed

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
data must allow this stakeholders to

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
1. access products

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
descriptions and verify if the price is

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
within an acceptable range so they can

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,599
spot damping practices for example

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,080
it must also help the tax and custod

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
customs administration in spotting other

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
illegalities

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,040
such as piracy and tax evasion

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,319
and third

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,280
it

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
must allow the development of economic

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
studies to support private entrepreneurs

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
or public politics

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,280
on the privacy requirement side the

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
disclosed data must protect the

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
importer's fiscal secrecy

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
this means that any data that could

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,000
reveal

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,879
specific details about a company's

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,599
business such as the value they paid the

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
amount they imported and from whom they

68
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,319
supplied

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
must be

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
not made public

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
from this setting i have to choose how

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,159
to meet these opposing requirements

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
as i am in a governmental agency i'm

74
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,000
more worried to appear right and simple

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
than being scientifically right and

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,040
complex

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,519
so i'll make some add-on decisions that

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
will sound reasonable

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
those are

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,480
i will split the data

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,798
into multiple different data sets

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
one of the data sets

83
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,720
will have all the transactions but i'll

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
remove all the business direct

85
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
identifiers such as name address and

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,519
city

87
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
other data sets will just have summaries

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,840
by city and state and product type for

89
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
instance

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,159
and in one last data set i'll just put

91
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
the company's registration information

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
i'll also omit from the database with

93
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,239
the transactions details all

94
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,640
transactions made for a product type

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
that was imported by less than four

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
companies

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
as a remark although my narrative here

98
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
is based on brazil's legal framework and

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
government decisions i think that this

100
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
scenario is similar for other other

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,680
countries

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
now let's put ourselves in the

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
adversary's shoes

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
three data sets are public

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
available

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,919
de-identified transactions contain all

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,240
the products imported their value and

108
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
weight

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,240
summary by city contains all the total

110
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,520
sum of weight and value by city

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
importers contain registration data

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,280
about the companies such as their city

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
i now the adversary know that the totals

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,440
shown

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,240
in the summary by city were produced by

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,199
partitioning the entrance scene in the

117
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,600
de-identifying transactions

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
so i can use these totals as

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
restrictions to an integer linear

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
optimization program

121
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
to find which partitions produce the

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
totals seen here

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
let's just make this more graphical so

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,400
we can visualize how this is done

125
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
i represent the transactions as

126
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,759
rectangles

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
their width

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
is proportional to their value and their

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
height is proportional to their weight

130
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,440
the total seams in the summary are

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,919
points in the cartesian plan

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,479
the dashed lines are boundaries that

133
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,440
signal

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
when overflown

135
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
that the solution is invalid

136
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
the idea is to stack the rectangles by

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
the border without overflowing the

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
city's totals as can be seen here

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,880
in a valid solution all rectangles

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,320
are stacked inside the region delimited

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
by the dashed lines

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,639
once i get a valid solution i can try to

143
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,280
swap some rectangles i can try to take

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
this green one here and place it in

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,479
other city as you can see if i do this i

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,960
will end up with an invalid solution

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,400
clearly shown by the overflow here the

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,199
algorithm used by commercial solvers

149
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
implements a backtracking strategy that

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,960
goes through all the possible states

151
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
once this is done i can gather all the

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
possible states where the solution is

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,479
valid

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,800
and check if some rectangles can only

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
produce a valid solution if they are in

156
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
certain cities

157
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,280
for instance i control all possible

158
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,919
states and find out that in every single

159
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,280
valid one

160
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,759
this green rectangle is placed in this

161
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
city

162
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
i can say that this transaction is then

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
locked into this city

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
this means that i have a mathematical

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,680
certainty that this transaction went to

166
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
some business based in the city

167
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,199
if this happens

168
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
and there is only one

169
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,919
business based on that city i can be

170
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
sure of my re-identification

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
the algorithm described which i think

172
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
has a broader usage

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
was used in our particular case study

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
to apply it to the brazilian official

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
foreign trade statistics we divided the

176
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,400
attack into phases and steps

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
the goal of these steps was to try to

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
lock the transaction into a single city

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
once this is done we just had to check

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,199
if there was a symbol important in that

181
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,199
city so a deterministic

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
re-identification could be performed

183
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
these are our results in the end we are

184
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
able to re-identify more than 2 000

185
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
transactions

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,879
although this represents just 0.9 of the

187
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,039
total number of transactions

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,199
the value of these transactions is

189
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,639
significant

190
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,960
more than

191
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,879
137 million dollars

192
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
we also use quantitative information

193
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,639
flow

194
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,599
to measure the information leakage

195
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
our multiplicative metric

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
shows that this attack increases the

197
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
chance of the adversary correctly

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,720
re-identifying a transaction by

199
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,160
168 times

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,599
some remarks

201
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,919
the results shown here only account for

202
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,160
a single month of data january 2021

203
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
the adversary we design

204
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
was computation computationally bounded

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
that means that we use the personal

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
computer and i intel i7 with 32

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,599
gigabytes

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
and the whole process took 62 hours of

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
active processing and we limited

210
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
uh trying to find the optimization

211
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,399
problem solution

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,240
for uh one minute for each instance

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,040
uh increasing that time could um give

214
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,080
some advantage to the adversary

215
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
the adversary that we designed

216
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
was as weak as possible and so it lacked

217
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
geographical understanding that means

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,399
that we didn't use any type of

219
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,040
geographical data that could uh aid in

220
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
the attack for instance

221
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
knowing that the business is near to a

222
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,560
port of entrance uh of that good being

223
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,360
ported could um give some uh

224
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
edge in on the adversary but we didn't

225
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
use that uh we didn't also use common

226
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,080
sense about commerce so for instance if

227
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
i

228
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,640
import of 2 000 tons of iron war was

229
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
going to a city

230
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,200
that

231
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
just had two business there a hospital

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
and i still knew

233
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
we didn't uh

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
the adversary wouldn't know which one

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
but for a real case scenario it's

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,880
obvious that uh steel mill was probably

237
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
the the imported behind the imported

238
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
behind two thousand tons of iron more

239
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
and also we didn't use any past foreign

240
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
trade data to aid in the knowledge of

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,040
the adversary but this data that we use

242
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
for january is

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,839
uh disclosed every month and so a real

244
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
world adversary could

245
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,120
do this exercise every month and gather

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
information that would help him

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
in attack

248
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
wrapping up with some conclusions and

249
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,279
discussion

250
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,160
uh the ad hoc disclosure control

251
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
techniques used by the brazilian

252
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,279
government are insufficient to protect

253
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,399
the business fiscal secrecy

254
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
after being formed about this

255
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,480
vulnerability the brazilian tax and

256
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
customs administration removed the

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
de-identified transactions data set from

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,160
their website and changed the importer's

259
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
data set periodicity

260
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
and lastly foreign trade statistics are

261
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,399
published by almost every country in the

262
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,160
world and they share some

263
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
standardization which means that

264
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,480
the attraction here

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
could be of broader concern but

266
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,279
the steps and phases that i've shown

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,000
previously would have to be adapted to

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,880
each case
