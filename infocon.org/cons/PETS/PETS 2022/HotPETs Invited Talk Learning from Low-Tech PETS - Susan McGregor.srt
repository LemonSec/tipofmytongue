1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,920
okay so our next speaker um really

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,160
especially in this audience doesn't need

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,960
much of an introduction this is our

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,200
invited talk for the morning session by

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,120
susan mcgregor who's going to be talking

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,840
about learning from low-tech pets um so

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
this will be about a half hour then some

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,800
time for

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,840
q a and then we'll break for our

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,800
lunch and virtual ice cream so those of

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,199
you that are

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
sorry

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
i shouldn't have said that quite that

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
way ice cream is not virtual if you are

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
here ice cream is very real and concrete

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
if you are here i was more saying that

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
uh to encourage the gather people not to

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,079
vanish as soon as susan is done speaking

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,120
um

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,280
so without further ado take it away

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
susan

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
hey thank you so much um i appreciate

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,199
the

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,440
in in real ice cream i was also going to

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
say that feels like a bait and switch

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,199
otherwise um

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,080
so hi everyone my name is susan mcgregor

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
i'm an associate research scholar at the

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,119
data science institute at columbia

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,720
university

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,600
and

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
today

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
i i was i was really torn about kind of

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
what to

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
what to present today um i'm sorry that

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
i can't be in australia with all of you

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
i definitely uh pondered

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
um or with so many of you i definitely

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
pondered the opportunity um

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,680
but

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
as i went back and forth on topics um i

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
really wanted to come back to something

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that actually i have been thinking about

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,439
since i got involved in privacy and

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,200
security about 10

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
10 years ago um and that was

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,799
doing what i do in the rest of my work

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,840
which is sort of thinking about

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,479
communities and how communities um

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,840
interact with

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
security and privacy technologies so

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
um the reason why i chose

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
learning from low tech pets is because

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
over the years i've come across a lot of

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
examples of different ways in which

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
communities and individuals have

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,159
taken steps to protect their privacy and

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
security and i want to be clear here

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,639
that when i talk about this a lot of the

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,878
principles that i am going to address i

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
think um

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,360
do inform a lot of the privacy enhancing

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,280
technologies that communities like this

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,840
are building um but i still think that

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
there's more that we can learn from them

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
and so that's kind of what i wanted to

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,040
address today so um when i say low tech

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,360
pets um i don't necessarily mean privacy

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
enhancing technologies um

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
that are

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,239
um

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,239
not complicated right because i think an

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
interesting thing about quote-unquote

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,480
low-tech pets is that very often they

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,239
are complicated and they actually take

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
quite a bit of effort to use

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
what i really mean in this case is not

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,720
using digital computers um and so

79
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
uh

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
what i want what i'm going to do is just

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
kind of take you through some examples

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,720
of

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
types of low-tech privacy-enhancing

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
technologies that have existed

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
throughout history

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
and then kind of reflect on what we

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
might take away from thinking about

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
these as designers of contemporary

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
privacy enhancing technologies

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
um and maybe some directions for kind of

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
research and development that this might

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
inspire so

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
um

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
sorry so i think one thing that i also

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
want to highlight here is that

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
you know privacy as we all know is a

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,360
complex is a complex idea right and it

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,799
doesn't mean the same thing to everyone

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,400
it doesn't mean the same thing to even

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,840
the same person

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,319
often uh depending on their context or

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,519
situation

103
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,360
but one thing i think we do know is that

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
privacy is not necessarily about secrecy

105
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,040
but it is about control right a lot of

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,959
the privacy enhancing technologies that

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
many of us work on and are interested in

108
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,280
are specifically about protecting the

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
ability to share information but being

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
able to control who it's shared with and

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,720
how

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
um and so i want to kind of

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
sort of put a point on that right now

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
and also to think about the fact that in

115
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319
many cases and obviously this is the

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
case in most

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,439
sort of

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
internet-based sort of network

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
technologies

120
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
privacy is also not necessarily about

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
being free from observation right so

122
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
depending on where you are i'm located

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,079
in the united states

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
there are notions of privacy that have

125
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
to do with not being watched right not

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
being seen by others and really

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,400
historically that's a very unusual

128
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
circumstance for people um in most cases

129
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
in history in human society having

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,080
actual privacy having the kind of

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,759
privacy where you were actually not

132
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
observed by other humans um is pretty

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,919
rare so in most cases the kinds of like

134
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,440
low-tech or community-driven

135
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
privacy-enhancing technologies that i'm

136
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
thinking of um

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
have to do with being able to have

138
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
control over information even when you

139
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
are being observed by other people

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
um and i think another thing that i that

141
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
that sort of emerges for me in thinking

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,280
about these examples is actually the

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
importance of destruction so this is

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
something that's sort of a perennial

145
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,160
issue

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
um and i would argue kind of a key

147
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
aspect of a lot of privacy enhancing

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,039
technologies outside of digital

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
computing um is the ability to destroy

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
um and that's not something that in the

151
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,479
case of low tech or sorry in the case of

152
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
digital technologies um is frankly

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
really feasible for most people to do

154
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
and i'm going to argue that that's a

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,560
problem and it's a problem that we

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
should work on

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
okay so uh now for i think sort of the

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
fun stuff which is just talking about

159
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,240
examples of uh low-tech pets throughout

160
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
history and kind of the strategies that

161
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
they employ um

162
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,199
so

163
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,680
again not these these strategies are not

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
going to be things that are a surprise

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
to probably anyone in this room right um

166
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
they these are common these are common

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
techniques that are used all the time in

168
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
digital and networked cuts

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,680
but again i just kind of want to lay

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
them out here for clarity so obfuscation

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,560
right which in which we disguise the

172
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
existence of information or sometimes

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
the mechanism of accessing it

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
what i'm calling physical ciphers which

175
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,520
are you know essentially unique locking

176
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
mechanisms which in many cases are going

177
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,479
to serve both to protect information

178
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
data artifacts whatever um but also kind

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
of serves an authentication mechanism um

180
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
in many instances

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,919
content ciphers again not not you know

182
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,319
not a unique idea or an unusual idea

183
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,520
here

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,039
but particularly when we're talking

185
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
about um

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,319
sort of community driven or low tech

187
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
pets we're usually talking about

188
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,919
often a kind of social steganography

189
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,560
right so a case where rather than sort

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
of um

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
there are cases where we see messages

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,639
are

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,080
physically obfuscated um but also

194
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
where the meaning of something is hidden

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,919
because

196
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
the sort of key to it is a kind of

197
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
out-of-band social knowledge right that

198
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,440
allows

199
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
the people reading the message to be

200
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
able to or unable to correctly interpret

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
um the content that they're seeing

202
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
um

203
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
and again of course strategic

204
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
destruction um and what destruction

205
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
looks like depending on the particular

206
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,960
technology in question will be different

207
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
um in some cases

208
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
um this is going to be really basic like

209
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
let's burn it all down kind of things or

210
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,160
let's burn specific items down um but

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
you know for example when we're talking

212
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
about social stigma it could also be the

213
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
evolution for example of a meme

214
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
so it could be something where the

215
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
context or meaning of something is

216
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
tweaked or adjusted in such a way that

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,919
it no longer means

218
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,400
what it used to mean and so

219
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
there comes this sort of in-group out

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
group function of

221
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,879
whether uh

222
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,759
whether

223
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
uh an outsider is up to date enough

224
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,639
essentially to correctly interpret um

225
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,319
a coded message

226
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,599
um so some of the fun examples uh i

227
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
don't know i think they're fun um of

228
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
obfuscations so

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
um

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
each of these is an example of a

231
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,240
different what i consider a different

232
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
type of obfuscation so on the left we

233
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,520
have a japanese puzzle box

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
this is a really fascinating practice

235
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
that originated in sort of the late 19th

236
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,560
century

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
with a few master craftsmen in japan

238
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
and it's thought that one of the

239
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,599
original

240
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
purposes of these boxes was actually to

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
hide tools and

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
you may have seen things like this

243
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
they're still sort of popular in novelty

244
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
shops um there remains one last living

245
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
uh master puzzle box maker

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
um today uh that sort of reached that

247
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
peak around world war ii um and it's

248
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
been uh apparently very difficult to

249
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
find different assistants um but the

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
puzzle boxes this is an example of a

251
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,160
seven of a seven step puzzle box um

252
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
you can imagine this box if not for kind

253
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,880
of the elaborate decoration it would be

254
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,160
hard to know that there was actually

255
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,519
supposed to be something in here which

256
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,440
is why i kind of put this in obfuscation

257
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
even though it fits into a couple of

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
categories

259
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,120
um

260
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
but they um actually the the currently

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
living craftsman has made up to 102 step

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
boxes and so different parts of the box

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
shift and slide in different directions

264
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
and in order to successfully open the

265
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
box you need to know not just the

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
direction but the order of the steps

267
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
that need to be completed

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
the middle the sort of middle picture

269
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,959
here is a a much more kind of petition

270
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
example uh this is i think not super

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
uncommon in um sort of like suburban

272
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,440
areas uh you wanna you know someone is

273
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
coming to visit or staying at your house

274
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
while you're away they're coming to

275
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
check on your plants or your pets um and

276
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,839
your your frozen your furry pets perhaps

277
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,680
um and

278
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,640
uh

279
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,399
the idea is that this is a stove this

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,880
looks like a stone but it is in fact um

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
you know a fake and inside of it is a

282
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
key

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
um

284
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,959
and the furthest right example is

285
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,680
actually a project that i did um uh

286
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
about i don't know sort of ten or more

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,839
years ago

288
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,320
my primary background is in journalism

289
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
and this was shortly after the snowden

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,440
leaks and there was an incident where

291
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
glenn greenwald

292
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
who sort of wrote the snowden story

293
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,280
um

294
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,560
[Music]

295
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
his partner was traveling through i

296
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
believe it was heathrow um he was

297
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
traveling through the airport and

298
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
airport security recognized who he was

299
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
and he was carrying

300
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,360
hard drives with him and they

301
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,040
confiscated the drives and it got me

302
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
thinking what if they didn't know that

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
he was carrying any data

304
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
and at the time i was traveling a lot

305
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,560
and i chose and

306
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,360
depending on your context

307
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
this style of necklace that had sort of

308
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,160
these big big rhinestones

309
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
was very very popular at the time it was

310
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
kind of everywhere uh and i thought

311
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,600
that's big enough to hide something in

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
and so i actually made a piece of

313
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,160
jewelry that i wore through an

314
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,920
international airport um that obfuscated

315
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
in this case just a small usb drive

316
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
right and so the idea that i wanted to

317
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,399
play with there was the i was the fact

318
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
that um you know

319
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
i could protect that data if it wasn't

320
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,920
recognizable as digital data right um it

321
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
would not you know if no one thought to

322
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,360
look um then it couldn't be invaded

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,399
um

324
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
so those are kind of like my examples of

325
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,040
obfuscation in low-tech pets

326
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,480
physical ciphers so these are some

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,200
really fun examples in my opinion on the

328
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
left we have an example which is

329
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
a

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
a number of years ago researchers

331
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
discovered a whole host of what they

332
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
call walked letters

333
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,639
and so this is an evolution of

334
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,680
um

335
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
especially sort of in the uh

336
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
when paper was very very expensive it

337
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
was not at all typical to actually put

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
things in an envelope right and so we

339
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
think about

340
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
like you know when i do um

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
you know education about privacy and

342
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,360
security right we talk a lot about

343
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
envelopes and protecting things and the

344
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,399
sort of male uh for me the male metaphor

345
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
is one that that i go to frequently but

346
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,839
that was actually really uncommon

347
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
because paper was extremely expensive

348
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
it was also very strong because it was

349
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
parchment in many cases

350
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
and so

351
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
in this example um and there's a

352
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,519
wonderful video set of links in the

353
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
slides that i can share

354
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,000
um

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
that demonstrates one one famous example

356
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
is mary mary queen of scots um on the

357
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,560
eve of her execution wrote a letter to

358
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,720
her brother um and she describes the

359
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
fact that she's been informed that she's

360
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
gonna be executed the next morning and

361
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
um

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
it shows the way in which she

363
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
essentially cuts a small slice of paper

364
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
um from the inside fold of her letter

365
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
and uses it to thread through in such a

366
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
way that in order to open the letter um

367
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
that that strip of paper would need to

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,519
be broken

369
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,720
and so it would both kind of

370
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
authenticate um the contents of the

371
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
letter to demonstrate that it hadn't

372
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,399
been opened or read in transit

373
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,519
but also served um as kind of a physical

374
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
cipher if you didn't know how to do it

375
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
or you didn't know how to undo it um you

376
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
might not successfully get to

377
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,639
get to the contents um the one on the

378
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,480
right the example on the right this is

379
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
um from a youtube channel that i imagine

380
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,839
many of you may be familiar with called

381
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,920
the lock picking lawyer

382
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,279
this was an interesting one that he

383
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
posted that initially he didn't know the

384
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,760
purpose of this is a bookmaker's lock

385
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
and so the purpose of this

386
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,880
device is actually to

387
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
record the last time that it was opened

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
um and so the mechanism itself is not

389
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
particularly complex but the important

390
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
thing about it is that it essentially

391
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,760
it times it time stamps it um and of

392
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
course because

393
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,399
uh if you were to open the lock to get

394
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
at the in this presumably the bag or box

395
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,920
of betting slips um you could place a

396
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,560
bet after the fact and so uh it serves

397
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,639
as an authentication mechanism that

398
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,639
there that the bedding has not been

399
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
tampered with by registering the last

400
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
time um

401
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
that that the lock was opened

402
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
um so those are some examples of

403
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,199
physical what i would call physical

404
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,800
ciphers of

405
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,279
a kind

406
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
i think one that's always really um

407
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,639
fascinated me

408
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,199
and that i always come back to when i

409
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,440
think about arguments that are commonly

410
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,519
made against um

411
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
people's or communities uh apparent

412
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
disinterest in privacy

413
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,120
and that is

414
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
the use of slang or community lexicons

415
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
for communicating so there's a few

416
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
different examples here

417
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
one on the left again some of you may be

418
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,079
familiar with this is the so-called

419
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,000
rogue's lexicon which was compiled by

420
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,760
george w matzel

421
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
he is most famous for being the first

422
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
police commissioner of new york city

423
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
and at the time that the nypd was

424
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
essentially founded

425
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,399
it was very common um and there are many

426
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,800
examples in many communities obviously

427
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
of this kind of thing where

428
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,639
essentially the

429
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
the thieves the criminals of new york

430
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,079
used a um

431
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,720
used a kind of lexicon that was

432
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,279
intentionally coded so that someone who

433
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,600
wasn't in on it uh overhearing their

434
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,519
conversations would not have any idea

435
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
any real creditable idea of what they

436
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
were talking about and so

437
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
one of mattzel's innovations was to do

438
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
was to actually compile

439
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
um to make an organized effort to

440
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
actually compile the contents of that

441
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
lexicon and publish them uh to

442
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
essentially break the code for uh what

443
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,120
would become new york's first police

444
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
force um

445
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
and again

446
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
some of these examples may well be

447
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
familiar to folks here um

448
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
i think many of us are

449
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,959
familiar with examples of

450
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,480
censorship-resistant

451
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
um

452
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
censorship resistance strategies using

453
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
uh again lexicons especially in

454
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,839
surveilled communications um so the use

455
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
of homophones and emoji

456
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,120
to

457
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
talk about taboo ideas in surveilled

458
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,279
chat systems and things like that um and

459
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,839
then the one on the lower right um is an

460
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,639
example a sort of recently uncovered

461
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,040
example of a um

462
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
of a cypher it's attributed to catherine

463
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
of aragon who was henry viii's first

464
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,759
wife um in which

465
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
uh a scholar recently sort of decoded

466
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
the message that suggesting that um this

467
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,199
was a this was a design for a piece of

468
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
jewelry in which she essentially

469
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
declared herself the true queen of

470
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,480
england even though she had been

471
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,959
overthrown for her sister aunt berlin

472
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
um and again an example where um

473
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,279
there's sort of a like a kind of

474
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,599
steganography there um

475
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,480
of interlocking letters and patterns

476
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,559
that are used to convey

477
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,199
meaning that um only recently sort of

478
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,079
has been

479
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,400
revealed by modern scholars again

480
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,199
probably was quite transparent to people

481
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
uh certain communities at that time

482
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
and then the last sort of set of

483
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
examples is just destruction so uh the

484
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,240
thing about low-tech pets is that

485
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,280
destruction isn't usually that

486
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
complicated it's something that almost

487
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
anyone can undertake without a lot of

488
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
difficulty burn it shred it smash it uh

489
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
whatever it is that you want to do melt

490
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,250
it um

491
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,559
[Music]

492
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
but i think a key again a really key

493
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
feature is the ability for not people

494
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,799
without special skills

495
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,120
uh to destroy information that they want

496
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
to get rid of um

497
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,240
and

498
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
as i say i think that that's actually a

499
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
much more important part of thinking

500
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,880
about

501
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
it is to me an increasingly important

502
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,120
part i think of thinking about um

503
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
privacy enhancing technologies that are

504
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,559
responsive to the needs and interests

505
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,200
and abilities of sort of large uh

506
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
communities

507
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,440
um

508
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
[Music]

509
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,320
so what can we take away from this um

510
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,160
in thinking about why low-tech pets work

511
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,280
uh in particular ways

512
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
um

513
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,240
for obfuscation one of the key features

514
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
for low-tech pets is that physical

515
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
access is required right and this is

516
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,840
again not an uh an unknown scenario in

517
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
digital privacy enhancing technologies

518
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
right where we create situations where

519
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
physical access is required to a device

520
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
um in order to access the data that it

521
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
contains

522
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,400
um

523
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,280
and

524
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
so there is

525
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
um

526
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,679
there's a and there's a limit to

527
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
resources right so

528
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
a human being can only try so many

529
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
combinations on a japanese puzzle box

530
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
right in a finite amount of time uh

531
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
someone who's looking to find the key to

532
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
break into a house

533
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
only will probably have a certain amount

534
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
of time um that they can

535
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
uh you know look for the special stone

536
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
before they're observed right or raised

537
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
suspicions um and so the reason why it

538
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,160
works is the reason why um

539
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
we can do obfuscation certain types of

540
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
association with digital data um which

541
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,679
is that

542
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,320
it is uh it requires some kind of access

543
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,960
to the device and the ability to and any

544
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
sort of time constrained in the kinds of

545
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,400
attacks that can be executed um but why

546
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
doesn't this work as well with digital

547
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
pets well

548
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,919
very few devices are truly offline

549
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,160
i remember many years ago actually at uc

550
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,360
security

551
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
there was a there was a panel talk or

552
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
something

553
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
about the security risks of iot

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
and

555
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
um a very

556
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
uh you know a question i raised at the

557
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
time which there was not particularly an

558
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,559
answer to and i think there's even less

559
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
of an answer to now is we just can't get

560
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
stuff that isn't on the internet right

561
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,039
um

562
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
you know it's more and more difficult to

563
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,679
find even you know to find you know sort

564
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,159
of just to find unconnected devices

565
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,840
right and this is a real problem i think

566
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,400
we all kind of recognize that um but i

567
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
think thinking about that strategically

568
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
as a limitation for

569
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
current digital pets and like how do we

570
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,080
do something about that um i think bears

571
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,200
reflection

572
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
um

573
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,799
physical cyphers so physical ciphers in

574
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
a low-tech scenario work because in

575
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
general there are a lot of people who

576
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
have the skills to customize the

577
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
functioning of

578
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,080
a lock or a box or what have you right

579
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
so if i want to secure my home i can put

580
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,559
you know three different locks and a

581
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
deadbolt and a floor bolt and a chain

582
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,679
and whatever uh you know over my door to

583
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
make sure that that people can't get it

584
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
right to protect whatever it is um i

585
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
have the skills to do that i have the

586
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
right to do that um

587
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
in many cases with digital technologies

588
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,760
you know one aspect of it is that the

589
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
vast majority of digital devices are

590
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
mass-produced and it's either very

591
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,520
difficult you need really specialized

592
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,039
skills and tools

593
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,440
or it is illegal to customize them in

594
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
any meaningful way so

595
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
um you know in i live in new york state

596
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,760
new york state just this year passed a

597
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,799
right to repair law um which obviously

598
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,400
applied that applies to digital

599
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
technologies and that's sort of a step

600
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,880
forward um but the reality is that in

601
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,360
many cases uh you know regular people

602
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
we're all kind of locked into

603
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,840
uh the devices that are handed to us or

604
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,080
made available to us and that's really

605
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
limiting when we think about

606
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
you know again what individuals or

607
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,000
communities might want or need um out of

608
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,159
uh privacy enhancing technology

609
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,080
content ciphers are effective because

610
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,919
natural language and communication are

611
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,360
constantly evolving it's just what

612
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
humans do

613
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,760
um

614
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
but also because in most cases when we

615
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,440
communicate with other people we have

616
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
multiple channels of communication right

617
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,919
so we have multiple spaces where we

618
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,720
interact um with the same people or

619
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
communities which makes

620
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,600
it possible to co-construct meaning and

621
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
also to adapt and evolve that meaning if

622
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
we need to

623
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,720
um

624
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,600
the when it comes to kind of natural

625
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
mechanisms for protecting privacy you

626
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,080
know i i think the main thing that i

627
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
think of is things like biometrics which

628
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,760
we all know are deeply problematic to

629
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,840
use as you know sort of authentication

630
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,320
uh our you know authentication devices

631
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
um and while we have made the progress

632
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,120
in terms of multi-factor authentication

633
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,400
and things like that um i think thinking

634
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,960
creatively about how we can introduce

635
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
more channels

636
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,640
into privacy enhancing technologies

637
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,880
is again just something that i think is

638
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,440
kind of interesting to think about

639
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
and then finally strategic destruction

640
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,280
again i think this is really important

641
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,520
um

642
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
you know when it comes to low tech stuff

643
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,280
i can always burn that letter you sent

644
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,919
me um i can always destroy something

645
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,960
i've been given um and when it comes to

646
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
digital technologies

647
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
this is pretty much what we've got right

648
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,919
um

649
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,720
so

650
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
uh if anyone recognizes this this is a

651
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,200
scene from the movie office space

652
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,880
where the

653
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
office inhabitants deeply frustrated the

654
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
behavior of their printer take it out to

655
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,159
a field and

656
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,520
uh bash it up at the base of all that um

657
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,200
but you know

658
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
as many as every as probably most people

659
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,440
here are aware you know we don't have a

660
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
way to selectively destroy digital data

661
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,559
and it's a real problem and i guess what

662
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,520
i'm saying is i think it's a real

663
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,480
problem

664
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
um okay so

665
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
what next uh so these are just some

666
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
ideas that i came up with in thinking

667
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
about this um

668
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,440
and

669
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
i am excited to hear what others what

670
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
others think um

671
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,120
i think one thing that i take away from

672
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,440
thinking about these examples is that it

673
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,880
makes sense to try to take things

674
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,039
offline um

675
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,960
you know we see some of this with the

676
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,200
switch to the evolution of physical

677
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
security keys um you know for

678
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,440
authentication uses a multi-factor

679
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
solution but i wonder if we can't get a

680
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,279
little bit more creative with this how

681
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
can we think about ways to take more

682
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,400
data offline more of the time

683
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
in such a way that it is just harder to

684
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,080
attack um and again i think that this is

685
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,159
um

686
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
you know i think that

687
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,559
what i would say is is

688
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,440
there are i think a lot of norms that we

689
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,400
work

690
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
there's a framework that we work within

691
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
or we think through

692
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
when we think about digital technologies

693
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,919
and digital technologies for privacy

694
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,760
that don't necessarily apply to most

695
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,279
people in other words

696
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,799
what i'm trying to do here is say let's

697
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
think outside what digital technologies

698
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
do and think instead about what people

699
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
do when they want to protect data and

700
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
what they're willing to do to protect

701
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,200
data and information and try to use that

702
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
as our inspiration for thinking about

703
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
even digital technologies um changing

704
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,520
the form factor uh you know

705
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
mostly we use touch screens number pads

706
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,960
keyboards like

707
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
can we do something other than that

708
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,880
right um can we think of different ways

709
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,159
of interfacing actually one of the

710
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,159
examples i meant to give for the

711
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,159
so-called physical ciphers

712
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,320
is one from my personal history so i

713
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
grew up in new york city

714
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
and at the time that i was growing up

715
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,600
car theft was extremely common now

716
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,360
apparently it's catalytic converter

717
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
unfortunately i don't have a car um

718
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,120
and

719
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,080
after some number of years um and we my

720
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
family had multiple

721
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
not nice cars stolen uh from outside of

722
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,039
our house

723
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,200
and um

724
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
our eventual solution was to have our

725
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
mechanic install something called an

726
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
ignition cutoff which was just an

727
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,760
interrupt on the electric uh ignition

728
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,480
mechanism in the vehicles and we had one

729
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,279
uh

730
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,240
we had one sort of relatively modern car

731
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,919
um where this was just a switch under

732
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,640
the steering column it was uh very small

733
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,919
you couldn't see it you had to really

734
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,360
just know that it was there and feel

735
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,799
around for it and that was the way that

736
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,320
you would then if you tried to start the

737
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
car without that or even hot wire it

738
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
without flipping that switch nothing

739
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
would happen

740
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,950
my favorite thing about it is that

741
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,600
[Music]

742
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
when my grandmother passed away we

743
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,440
inherited her car

744
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,559
which was a 1989 oldsmobile

745
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,720
98 model uh which was a huge huge car

746
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,440
did not even have power steering um

747
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
and there was no way to put an ignition

748
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,279
cut off of the kind we had in the more

749
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,919
modern vehicle into that car and so

750
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,279
instead the ignition cutoff was wired to

751
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,000
um the radio and the brights and so if

752
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,600
you got in this car and you did not

753
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,840
first power on the radio and flip on the

754
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,919
brights you would not be able to start

755
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,960
the car right so this is an example of

756
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,120
taking you know a known interface with a

757
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
known vulnerability and finding a

758
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,760
different way to interact with it

759
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,039
um

760
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,760
also i think just leveraging

761
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
human actual human behavior so i

762
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,279
mentioned this before like there are

763
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,559
things that people are willing to do

764
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,360
that they're happy to do um that may or

765
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,799
may not jive with the natural or easy

766
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,640
affordances of

767
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
um

768
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,399
of digital technologies and so i think

769
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,399
if we're willing to to kind of start

770
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,360
there

771
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
um and work through those needs and

772
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,799
those desires then we will be able to

773
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,000
come up with

774
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,679
more

775
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,440
creative and unique solutions that are

776
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,559
solving

777
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,159
more sort of real problems for real

778
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,039
people

779
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,640
um

780
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
and finally and i know this is a tricky

781
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,799
one uh we need to make it so that we can

782
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,880
delete stuff or destroy stuff

783
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
selectively or something right because

784
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,399
right now that inability is really

785
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,600
um is really hampering um individuals

786
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
abilities to control their information

787
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,919
right um

788
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,520
in preparation for this talk i was

789
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,720
rereading a paper by dana boyd

790
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,200
about the way that teens in the u.s use

791
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,679
social media um and some of you may have

792
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,720
heard of this strategy but um

793
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
she talked to a pair of women who talked

794
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
about their different strategies which

795
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
was basically one of them would just

796
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,600
delete their account every anytime that

797
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
they weren't actively online so as far

798
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,559
as it appeared to anyone else uh they're

799
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,840
simply

800
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
her account simply didn't exist unless

801
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
she was literally online reading

802
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
messages um and so again you know we do

803
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,080
have technologies that allow for that

804
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,720
kind of deletion um

805
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,080
but it's not in control of it is not as

806
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,720
it's only available to users when the

807
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
developer has made it available as

808
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,559
opposed to

809
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,520
um

810
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,200
as opposed to being accessible to the

811
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
individual and something that really

812
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,799
anyone can do and this goes for you know

813
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,960
basic stuff like you know hard drives

814
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,919
and thumb drives things like that um

815
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,360
and you know again i know that there are

816
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,120
some efforts out there this but like i

817
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,159
think we should i think it would be

818
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,919
interesting to try to pursue that a

819
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,000
little bit further um

820
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
and that is all

821
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
um i don't if there are any questions

822
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,960
i'd love to hear ideas et cetera et

823
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
cetera so thanks so much for your time

824
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
and attention and i will

825
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,890
turn off my screen now

826
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:40,080
[Applause]

827
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,399
okay uh thank you very much for the talk

828
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,799
susan i particularly liked the

829
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,639
story about pork knocking on oldsmobile
