00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,960
hello my name is christo wilson and i'm

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,400
an associate professor in the corey

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,759
college of computer sciences at

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,600
northeastern university

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,800
in this video i'm going to tell you

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,719
about our recent study entitled setting

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,960
the bar low our websites complying with

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
the minimum requirements of the ccpa

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
this was joint work with former

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,560
northeastern undergrad maggie van

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,400
norwick and this work was funded by the

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,039
u.s national science foundation

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,680
as of 2022 the united states does not

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,599
have a comprehensive federal level

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,439
online privacy law

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,880
this is why the california consumer

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,840
privacy act or the ccpa is so important

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
as the us's most populous state

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
california has an outsized role in

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
setting national policy

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
thus the ccpa is currently the most

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
important online privacy law in the u.s

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
at a high level the ccpa does two things

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
it requires that websites and apps

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
notify people about data collection and

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
it creates a number of rights for data

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
subjects including the ability to opt

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,079
out of data collection as well as access

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,480
modify and delete collected data the

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
ccpa went into effect in january 2020 so

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
websites available at californians

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
should be honoring its terms

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,560
furthermore as of july 2022 four u.s

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,240
states have passed laws that are similar

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,479
to the ccpa and six more states have

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,280
similar laws under active consideration

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
so across the us the ccpa's influence is

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
already being felt

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
lastly i will note that as of this

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
moment the ccpa is in the process of

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,159
being superseded by an even newer law

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
the california privacy rights act or

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,799
cpra which is for the most part even

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,720
stricter about online privacy than the

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,000
ccpa

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
rulemaking for the cpra is underway

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
right now and the law is slated to go

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
into effect in january 2023

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
given that the ccpa is currently in

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,439
effect we wondered whether websites are

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,600
complying with its provisions

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
this question was motivated in part by

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
many excellent studies that have looked

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
at compliance with europe's gdpr we

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
found the compliance was very much

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
lacking we wondered whether california

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
could be facing similar problems

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,759
especially because as of july 2022

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,920
regulatory enforcement of the ccpa has

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
not yet begun in earnest

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,759
this issue of enforcement is critical

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,318
because the ccpa and the cpra do not

63
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,400
include rights of private action it is

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
up to regulators in california to

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,400
enforce these laws thus understanding

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
whether the ccpa is being complied with

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
in the wild is critical because if it's

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
not measurement is the first step

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,040
towards triggering enforcement actions

70
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
finally i've already mentioned how other

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
u.s states are passing laws that emulate

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
the ccpa and california itself is

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
drafting new rules around the cpra and

74
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
it turns out that the ccpa is not being

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
complied with these insights may be

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,879
useful for other states that are

77
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
currently still drafting online privacy

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
laws and for california regulators

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,560
now the ccpa is a complex law with many

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
components rather than trying to measure

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
compliance with them all we decided to

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
measure compliance with what we thought

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
would be the simplest and most obvious

84
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
facet of the law

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,560
this little link right here the do not

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
sell my personal information link we

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
call this the dns mpi link for short the

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
ccpa requires that websites that are

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
covered by the law include a link on

90
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
their home page this link must say do

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,720
not sell my personal information or a

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,879
limited number of alternate phrasings

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,239
and clicking the link must bring the

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
user to a webpage where they can learn

95
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
about and exercise their rights under

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
the ccpa in other words the dns mpi link

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
is supposed to be an easily recognizable

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
one-stop shop for californians to opt

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,200
out of data collection and activate

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
their data subject rights

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
given that the dns api link is simple

102
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,360
for websites to adopt and relatively

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
straightforward for us to crawl on the

104
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
web we decided to make it the focus of

105
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
our study we treat the dns mpi link as a

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,519
bellwether for broader compliance with

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,319
the ccpa if a website doesn't have a dns

108
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,400
mpi link we believe it's unlikely that

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
they are in compliance with the more

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
complex aspects of the ccpa like data

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
collection opt-outs or data access

112
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,840
requests

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
so far so simple crawl websites and

114
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,879
identify one hyperlook easy study

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,080
well it turns out that things are not

116
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
that simple the issue is that the ccpa

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
has complex eligibility criteria it only

118
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,360
applies to websites owned by private

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
parties that meet one of the following

120
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
criteria they must have annual gross

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
revenue of at least 25 million dollars

122
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,238
uh selling they must sell the personal

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
information of at least 50 000 unique

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
californians or they need to derive at

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
least 50 of their annual revenue from

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,960
the sale of californians personal

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,759
information i'll note that the cpra

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,240
raises the second criteria from 50 000

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
to 100 000 unique californians

130
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
these eligibility criteria make studying

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
ccpa compliance very challenging if a

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
given website doesn't have a dns mpi

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
link is that because it's violating the

134
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
law or because the law simply does not

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,759
apply to it

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,880
this brings me to the goals and

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
contributions of our study

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
ours is the first study to study

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
ccpa compliance among websites we focus

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
on the dns mpi link as the bellwether

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,759
for compliance and we use market

142
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
intelligence data that we purchased to

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,520
try and distinguish lack of compliance

144
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
with the law from ineligibility under

145
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,479
the law

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,800
as i will discuss we also use the

147
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
presence of embedded ad tech on web

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
pages as a leading indicator of which

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
websites are potentially engaged in the

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
cell of data and thus implicated under

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,680
the law

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
we conducted three crawls which lets us

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,759
lets us examine changes in compliance

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,520
with the law over the over time

155
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
including adoption and removal of dns

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
mpi links and updates to dns mpi linked

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,039
text

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,960
we investigate the use of geofences that

159
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,440
dynamically show dns and mpi links just

160
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,080
to californians this practice is legal

161
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
under the ccpa but raises problems that

162
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
we discuss in the paper

163
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
lastly we investigate whether dns mpi

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,759
links are displayed in a clear and

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
conspicuous manner as required under the

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
law

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
this is a short video so i won't have

168
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
time to cover all of our results if

169
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
you're interested i urge you to read the

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
paper

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
let's briefly discuss our data gathering

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,199
approach we started with a frontier for

173
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639
our crawler composed of roughly a

174
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
million domains drawn from the trancotop

175
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
list and a list of well-known ad tech

176
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
companies

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
our crawler was able to capture

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
non-empty home pages for 733 000 of

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
these domains

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
after applying an english language

181
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,120
filter we are left with roughly 500 000

182
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,639
home pages of these only 10 000 included

183
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,479
a dns mpi link versus 220 000 that

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,800
included a link to a privacy policy

185
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
also for context 738 000 of these

186
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
websites did embed ad tech

187
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
we repeated our crawl three times in

188
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,759
summer 2020 late fall 2020 and spring

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,280
2021

190
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,639
at this point we have a lot of data

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,280
about which websites adopted dns mpi

192
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
links but we have no idea which websites

193
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
are actually covered by the ccpa

194
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
to address this problem we bought data

195
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,759
from a marketing analytics company

196
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,199
called semrush

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
semrush sold us estimates of the unique

198
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
number of visitors for 203 000 of the

199
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
websites in our corpus

200
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,599
recall that unique visitors from

201
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
california is the second eligibility

202
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
criteria for the ccpa

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,840
the data from semrush was for all u.s

204
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
visitors as we scaled the numbers down

205
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
proportionate to california's online

206
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,720
population

207
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
these are the numbers we use to estimate

208
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,479
which websites may be covered by the

209
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
ccpa

210
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,599
so let's go back to our original

211
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,560
question are websites adopting dns mpi

212
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,440
links

213
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
this scatter plot shows the 203 000

214
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
websites in our corpus for which we had

215
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,759
estimates of unique visitors we

216
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,599
organized these websites by popularity

217
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
along the x-axis and unique visitors

218
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
from california on the y-axis the vast

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
majority of websites are gray dots which

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
means they did not have a dns mpi link

221
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
on their home page

222
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
blue dots are websites that did have a

223
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
dns mpi link

224
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
let's start by looking at all the

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,720
websites in the lower half of the figure

226
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,599
these websites all fall below the cpra

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
eligibility criteria of 100 000 unique

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
visitors from california meaning it's

229
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
likely the cpra and for the most part

230
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
the ccpa do not apply to these websites

231
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,879
ninety-five percent of the websites in

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
our sample fall into this category this

233
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,599
helps explain why dns npi link adoption

234
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
is so low overall on the web the ccpa

235
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
simply does not apply to most websites

236
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
however 81 of all the websites in our

237
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,360
sample that do include a dns mpi link

238
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
are in this lower half of the figure

239
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
which suggests that many websites are

240
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
adopting the dns mpi link even though

241
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,599
they may not be legally required to do

242
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,720
so

243
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,639
now let's focus our attention on the top

244
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
left corner of the figure there are 10

245
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,200
000 websites in this area that are above

246
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
the ccpa's eligibility criteria of 50

247
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
000 unique visitors yet only 18 of them

248
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,519
have adopted dns mpi links

249
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
if we restrict ourselves even further

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
there are 5 000 websites that are above

251
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
the cpra's eligibility criteria of 100

252
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,040
000 unique visitors yet only 23 of them

253
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,160
have adopted the dns mpi link these

254
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,320
results are troubling they suggest that

255
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,399
the vast majority of the vast majority

256
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,480
of websites that the ccpa is meant to

257
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,800
apply to have not started complying with

258
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,760
the law

259
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,440
now you may be thinking hold on maybe

260
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,519
these websites don't have the dns mpi

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
link because they aren't selling

262
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
personal information well 97 of the

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,800
websites in this region include embedded

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
ad tech so yes these websites are

265
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,560
potentially involved in the data

266
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
business so it's likely they are

267
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
implicated by the ccpa

268
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,600
the ccpa states that dns mpi links must

269
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
be clear and conspicuous but it does not

270
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
define what that means here we've taken

271
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,839
the w3c web accessibility initiatives

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,000
guidelines as our criteria for assessing

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,760
conspicuousness

274
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
this cdf shows the contrast ratio of dns

275
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,640
mpi terms of service and privacy policy

276
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,120
links on the website's inner sample the

277
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,800
wa guidelines specify the two levels of

278
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
accessibility with double a being ok

279
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
contrast ratio and aaa being very clear

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
contrast

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
we see that 40 percent of websites in

282
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,839
our sample fail to meet the double a

283
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,200
criteria five to ten percent meet the

284
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,480
double a criteria and over fifty percent

285
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
do meet the triple a criteria

286
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
with a spike in the end corresponding to

287
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
websites that have high contrast black

288
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,279
on white text

289
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
these results suggest that roughly half

290
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
of the websites in our sample are not in

291
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,200
compliance or could at least improve

292
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
their compliance with the display

293
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
requirements of the ccpa

294
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,440
what about where dns mpi links are shown

295
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
this heat map aggregates the locations

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
of the dns mpi links on the home pages

297
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
we crawled scaled to a standard 1080p

298
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
aspect ratio

299
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
note that this figure is log scaled and

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,519
the vast majority of the heat is along

301
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,959
the bottom edge

302
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
this is unsurprising and matches our

303
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
findings for privacy policy in terms of

304
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,560
service link locations websites

305
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
overwhelmingly put these links at the

306
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
bottom of the home page

307
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
whether this counts as clear and

308
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,240
conspicuous is unclear on the one hand

309
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
this design pattern is so common maybe

310
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
people expect to find this information

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
at the bottom of web pages on the other

312
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
hand we know that people rarely scroll

313
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
to the very bottom of web pages so this

314
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,920
seems like a non-ideal place to put

315
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,000
legally required and critical privacy

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
information

317
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
if you are curious there is much more

318
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
interesting analysis in our paper we

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
find a small but significant number of

320
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
websites using geofences to restrict

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,279
access to dns and pi links we find that

322
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,160
over time compliance with the dns mpi

323
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,079
link requirement is barely growing at

324
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,200
all

325
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,360
we also find that over time websites are

326
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,760
not adjusting their dns mpi links to

327
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
reflect changes in the law this

328
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
unfortunately does not bode well for the

329
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,839
rollout of cpra in january

330
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,079
2023 we accept that dns mpi links are a

331
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,000
reasonable proxy for compliance with the

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
ccpa then we find that overall

333
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
compliance with the law is low even

334
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,760
accounting for the law's complex

335
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
eligibility requirements

336
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,839
that said one of our primary findings is

337
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
that measuring ccpa and cpra compliance

338
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
is very challenging given these complex

339
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,519
eligibility criteria

340
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,279
finally it is clear that much more study

341
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,519
is needed here we did not investigate

342
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
other aspects of ccpa compliance like

343
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
honoring opt-out requests or data access

344
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
requests

345
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
plus online privacy laws in the us are

346
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
changing rapidly so understanding

347
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
whether they are working is critical

348
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
if i have one ask for regulators it's to

349
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
please include more uniform disclosure

350
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
requirements in future online privacy

351
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,079
laws if we can't tell who the law is

352
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,160
meant to apply to we can't actually help

353
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
you assess compliance

354
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
thanks i hope you enjoyed this video and

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,680
