00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,160
hi my name is igor zavalishin i will

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,640
present the results of our analysis of

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
modern smart home systems and all of the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
privacy and high-tech technologies for

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
those proposed in the last decade

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,599
we specifically concentrate on systems

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,960
that rely on a local smart hub device in

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
their design and make use of its

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
capabilities

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
i will hopefully convince you that there

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,400
is little privacy in smart home systems

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
nowadays but there are ways to change

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
that for the better

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
this is a joint work with my colleagues

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
axel ague arunderas and etienne river

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
we are from uc level and series in

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,919
belgium

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
just to give you some context let me

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
first define what we are dealing with

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
nowadays there are millions of smart

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,000
home devices available on the market

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
they allow us to have better control of

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,719
our lives and automate daily routines

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,280
at the same time these very same devices

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,600
can also be used to spy on us

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
they can control the environment we live

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,080
in they can watch us and listen to every

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
word we say

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
as a consequence many smart home owners

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,439
both existing and potential ones raise

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,520
privacy concerns regarding sensitive

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
data collection and processing without

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,360
their awareness or consent

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,320
to understand this problem let's look

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,560
into how these devices operate as part

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
of a smart home live system

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,680
we have a sensor device on the left that

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
operates within a smart home and

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
collects sensor data

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
then we have a smart hub in the middle

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,159
that forwards sensor data to the cloud

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
server on the right

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
there the data is being stored and

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,560
processed by various automation rules

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
and third-party services

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
the cloud server can also respond back

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
by sending commands to local actuators

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
that are again forwarded by the hub

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,839
device

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,520
but between the hub and the cloud server

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,079
we have this so-called data control

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,119
border

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
that define the amount of control users

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
have over the sensor data collected by

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
the devices they own

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
while the data remains within a home

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
environment the users can still control

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
it even if it means simply disconnecting

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
the device from power or network

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
connection

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
but once the data is in the cloud the

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
users lose all the control and have no

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
way to verify how that data is being

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
used who it is being shared with and why

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,560
it is being collected in the first place

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
so a smart hub represents a single point

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
of control for users privacy

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
and it can be used as a foundation for

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
building systems that implement among

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
others

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
traffic confusion to protect for

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
instance the device and user activity

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
from inter internet service providers

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
data minimization to reduce the volume

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,159
of sensitive data being sent to the

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,599
cloud

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
access control both for app or user

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
activities

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,080
local computing node to offload some

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
privacy sensitive tasks

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,720
and a lot more

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
we wanted to understand how these hubs

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,239
are currently being used to protect the

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,120
user's privacy both in existing systems

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
and those that were proposed by the

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,518
research community

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
to answer this question we first defined

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
an analytical framework that helped us

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
to compare systems that often had

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
different design and threat models

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
implemented different privacy enhancing

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,159
technologies or even considered

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
different operational modes

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
we then selected 10 most popular smart

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
home systems among commercial and open

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
source ones and compared those side by

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
side

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,920
finally we collected a data set of 137

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
papers on smart home security and

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
privacy published at top conferences

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,720
workshops and journals for the last

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,760
decade

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,239
and use the same framework for the

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,000
comparison

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
and of course our selection includes a

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,679
generous amount of past papers

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,400
so let's start with existing smart home

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,798
systems

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
here is a table showcasing the results

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,639
of our analysis

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
the systems were compared based on their

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
system and threat models third party

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
application support access control modes

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
and stakeholders share

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,560
after our analysis several things became

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
clear

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
first commercial smart home systems are

118
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,720
still predominantly cloud based and use

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
cloud servers to collect process and

120
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
store large volumes of sensitive sensor

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
data

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
open source systems on the other hand

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
target local execution environment do

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
not depend on cloud resources and as a

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
consequence provide better privacy

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,479
control to their users

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,960
we also see a gradual shift towards

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
hub-centric design among a few

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
commercial systems

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
namely apple homekit and philips hue

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
that use hub devices for local first

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
data processing

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
with cloud servers being used for backup

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,160
or remote taxes

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
however such an initiative is still very

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
rare and it's vendor specific

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
secondly we notice an alarming trend

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,759
among commercial systems in which the

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,120
same entity acts as both device app and

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
platform provider and controls the full

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
cycle of data collection and processing

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
this way one single company gains an

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
unprecedented access to both device and

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
user activities and can aggregate a

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
latch volume of sensitive data that

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
would normally be impossible in a

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,160
multi-vendor setting

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
among open source systems this is not

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,759
the case

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,840
only the core platform is offered the

151
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
users are free to choose the devices and

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,599
apps of the hrs

153
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,039
finally we see that commercial systems

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
rarely recognize the threat of platform

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
provider and concentrate instead on app

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,240
or device provider threats

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
they offer no ways for users to verify

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
the platform before using it

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
nor to specify their preferences

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
regarding sensor data collection and

161
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,520
processing

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
open source systems generally have a

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
large community of developers that

164
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
collectively do code reviews and

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
security checks

166
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,759
aiming to minimize the privacy risk for

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,639
the users

168
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
expert users can also freely customize

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
the system according to their

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
preferences and needs

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,319
now let's look into the state of the art

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
in our paper we provide a taxonomy of

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,720
various privacy enhancing technologies

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
proposed for the smart home systems over

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
the last decade

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,440
again we group them based on system and

177
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
threat models

178
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,199
the type of paths they implement and

179
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
where those are applied

180
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,440
a significant number of research

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,400
proposals concentrated on protecting

182
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,639
vulnerable and often unpatched device

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
software components and communication

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
protocols from external attackers

185
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
however proprietary software and

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
protocols of modern smartcom systems

187
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,680
make it a challenging task

188
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
and often hinder the development and

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,759
application of privacy enhancing

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,599
technologies

191
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,319
due to this reason smart hubs are often

192
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
the only place where pads can be applied

193
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
some of those can be very effective

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
especially those that operate on network

195
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,720
or application levels

196
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
we see a rise of proposals for noble

197
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,599
privacy aware system designs and

198
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
programming models but their threat

199
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,280
models rarely consider the platform

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
provider as a threat and even less so

201
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,319
for a device provider

202
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,840
so

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
here let's make a stop for key takeaways

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
from our analysis

205
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,199
a large wall fraction of smart home

206
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,520
systems are still cloud based which

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
limits the use the user controls over

208
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
sensor data

209
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
however a local first model has gained

210
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,639
traction over the last few years and is

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
gradually adopted by the industry

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,759
leaders

213
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
we see a similar trend among research

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
proposals

215
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,440
early works on smart home systems

216
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
strongly advocated for a local

217
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
hub-centric design

218
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,159
but later switched to hybrid and

219
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
increasingly cloud-centric architectures

220
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
following the design of commercial

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,519
systems

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
to it today however we see a backward

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
trend with computation and storage

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,600
functionality moving back to the edge

225
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
where fine grain data flow control is

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
possible

227
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,560
overall the smart home market is still

228
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
very fragmented and lacks common open

229
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,120
standards for device connectivity

230
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
application development and data

231
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,480
transfer

232
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
such standards would not only allow the

233
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
users to easily migrate from one

234
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,399
platform to another but would also make

235
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,519
it impossible possible sorry to inspect

236
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
and customize a given system according

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
to user privacy preferences and needs

238
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
finally the threats associated with

239
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,760
device and platform providers are really

240
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
addressed in existing systems although

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
technologies exist for secure and

242
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
verifiable even

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,200
data processing and storage in untrusted

244
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,519
environments like sjx or trotsdom

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
power analysis results showed that there

246
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
is still a lot to be done to improve the

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
privacy properties of smart home systems

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
and we have tools and technologies to do

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,800
just that

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
what we are missing though is a common

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
vision of what privacy friendly smart

252
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
home systems should look like

253
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
we want to take this opportunity to

254
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
suggest a few ideas that may help to

255
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
make this vision a reality

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
we present our smart home manifesto

257
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
we would like to make a case for a

258
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
privacy friendly smart home operating

259
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
system that will bootstrap the

260
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
development of noble highly flexible and

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
truly distributed smart home services

262
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
we urgently need to rethink the ways we

263
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,959
design and build smart home systems

264
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,560
and offer a unified and most importantly

265
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,160
vendor-independent operating system for

266
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,839
those

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
the systems that would allow easy

268
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
development deployment and consumption

269
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
of various smart home services

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
and would have a built-in support for

271
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
privacy enhancing technologies that can

272
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,760
be easily activated when using a given

273
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
service

274
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
thank you
