1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,280
okay let's get started so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,439
welcome everybody to hot pets 2022 um

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,120
i'm very happy to be able to bring you

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
today's hot pets at least

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
with a bunch of you live here together

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,440
in the same room

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
so just like pets this has been an

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,400
interesting uh schedule to put together

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
with remote attendees in both north

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
america and europe the

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,840
challenge was even more difficult for us

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
because unlike pets we really want hot

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,440
pets to be a very interactive event

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,320
and

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
that is difficult when half of your

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,399
attendees boobs

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
are asleep at any given time i don't

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,480
know why my

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,839
share screen just stopped

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,320
let me reach

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,600
okay

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,039
i don't know

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
so um yes this is intended to be very

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,320
much an interactive sort of discussion

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
based thing we

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
rebecca and i spent a lot of actual time

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
this year trying to brainstorm ways to

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
bring hot pets back to being a highly

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
discussion centric interactive workshop

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
rather than a continuation of the

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,640
technical program of pets so we have

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
four really amazing invited speakers as

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,080
well as

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
five contributed

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,880
presentations we had a handful of very

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
very good

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
technical type

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,720
submissions that we decided not to

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
accept not on merit but because we

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,399
really wanted to facilitate things that

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,200
would be

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
sort of

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
discussion oriented so

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
uh please

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,759
take that to heart we've asked the

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
speakers who have 30 minutes to spend 10

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,759
to 15 of those minutes actually talking

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,360
with the goal of getting you guys

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
talking for the remaining 15 to 20

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
minutes and it will be very awkward if

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
you do not spend that uh 15 to 20

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,159
minutes talking with that said do not

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,080
behave like these kangaroos let's keep

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
things uh

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
civil in our discussions

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,760
so here's a brief overview of the

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
program we have sort of the scene for

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,680
north americans time in the first

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,400
session

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
beginning with our first keynote and

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
then two contributed talks and then an

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
invited talk by um so the

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
keynote will start right away by alyssa

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,360
redmiles the uh invited talk is by susan

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
mcgregor and then a fairly large gap in

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
the middle just like with pets followed

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
by

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
a session that is at a same time for

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
people joining us from um europe and

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,879
there again we have a invited talk by

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,760
vanessa teague and a keynote by uh tanya

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,599
lokat so those

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,560
should be quite quite good

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
and in the middle of course

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,200
we have ice cream

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,959
we have been promised that ice cream

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
this year will be a spectacle to behold

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
so i am counting on some sort of koala

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
appearing ice cream or something of the

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
effect

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
but we'll have to wait and see what

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
exactly what exactly transpires at

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,000
lunchtime and for those of you joining

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
us from gather town you are very much

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
encouraged to go to the ice cream

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
section of gather town and bring your

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
own ice cream and last year we had an

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
epic dance party i think we should try

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
to repeat that

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,519
so yes that's all i wanted to say for

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,760
these opening remarks our first talk is

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,159

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,319
good uh so hello everyone from a very

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
very early morning in europe

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
uh i'm going to introduce uh alyssa who

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
uh the faculty member at the max planck

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
institute

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,519
uh her work focuses on reputational

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
economic and social science methods to

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
understand users security privacy and

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
online safety related decision making

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
processes i'm very excited to hear her

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,360
talk about sex work and technology

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
lessons

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
for internet governance and digital

109
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,478
society so for that i'm gonna

110
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
pass over the

111
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,358
mic to alyssa

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,919
thanks for the kind introduction um let

113
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
me just

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,000
share some slides

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,080
wonderful um so as uh becca said i will

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
be talking about um sex work and

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
technology and what we can learn

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
or at least think about in terms of

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
internet governance and privacy as well

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
as kind of safety more generally um from

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
uh sex workers

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
and this work is um of course

123
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
collaborative

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
with a number of different folks um

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
uh both from inside of and outside of

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
the sex working community

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
so sex workers make up a sizable portion

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
of the global workforce an estimated one

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
in every 200 people

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,919
will have worked in the sex industry in

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,919
their lifetime

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
and sex work is both criminalized and

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
stigmatized and so in australia sex work

134
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
is regulated but in much of the rest of

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
the world

136
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
it is criminalized um or

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
kind of operates under unusual

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,160
legal regulations

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
and as a result

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
that can create a lot of stigma and

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
marginalization

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,840
not just because of the legal landscape

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
but because of the general kind of

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,520
social landscape toward talking about

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
sex and sex work in particular

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,199
um technology is used in sex work in a

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
variety of ways and so there's online

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,639
only sex work where you have platforms

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
like say chatterbeat where people will

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,600
do

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
virtual kind of strip shows

152
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,319
or platforms like only fans that have

153
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,880
gotten a lot of attention recently

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,840
where people will sell a digital sexual

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
content um so this can be

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
videos images um even kind of sexting

157
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
services where you can talk to the

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
person who creates that content

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
and then of course for in-person sex

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
work there's also

161
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
a digital component where people will be

162
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
doing digital advertising or

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
communicating with their clients or

164
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
using safety technologies and we'll talk

165
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
about that a bit today

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
um so today's focus is on the

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
intersection of sex work and technology

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
and particularly kind of the role of

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
safety and what safety means in this

170
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,759
context

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,400
and the reason that i want to talk to

172
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,479
the pets community about sex work and

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,680
technology

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
is because if we design for people kind

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
of at the margins we

176
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
are better able to design for safety and

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,199
for everyone and also

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
allow ourselves not to exclude those who

179
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,000
are already being excluded um

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
you know even further by the way that we

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,000
create our technologies

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
so i'll start today by talking about

183
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
work

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
with in-person sex workers and that was

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
a two-year-long research project um in

186
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
three countries where sex work is

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,199
legal and regulated um and then

188
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
toward the end of the talk i'll talk

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,280
about how things changed with the covet

190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,639
pandemic

191
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,599
and talk a bit about how the risks that

192
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
folks face changed as they went

193
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,000
completely online with the kind of work

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,840
that they do

195
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
so in this first part of the talk um

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
i'll talk about the results of this this

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
research project

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
and in this project we did both

199
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,680
interviews and surveys with sex workers

200
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
um and when working with this population

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
because of uh the sensitive nature of

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
the work

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
even though we were studying um folks

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
who were working in countries where sex

205
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,639
work is legal um there's still a lot of

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,960
stigma a lot of marginalization and

207
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
different

208
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,400
kind of layers of migration status and

209
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
etc that can be involved and so

210
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
we thought

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,400
in a lot of detail about

212
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,599
the protection mechanisms um that we

213
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,240
would use in doing this research right

214
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
and so these interviews um were

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
conducted

216
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
with uh end-to-end encryption and people

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,960
could do phone or video interviews as is

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
typical or chat based interviews so that

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
we never saw their face never heard

220
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
their voice none of that was recorded

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
um part of why the project was a two

222
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
year long exercise

223
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,839
was because recruitment of course

224
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,880
requires a great deal of kind of trust

225
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,320
and the sex working community is uh very

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
kind of tightly knit and very reasonably

227
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
um not necessarily super open to

228
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
outsiders

229
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
coming in especially as they've been

230
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
very kind of over researched and over

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,600
regulated

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
and so a lot of time was spent um

233
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
building up relationships with the

234
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
community building up trust um and doing

235
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
in-person you know recruitment so forth

236
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,880
uh we also wanted to ensure

237
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
that we had a sex working consultant um

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
who was the active member of the sex

239
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
working community who could ensure that

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,959
the work that we were doing

241
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
and the way that we were going about it

242
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,880
was kind of comfortable appropriate and

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
ethical beyond the conventional ethics

244
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
board review because of course folks on

245
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
the ethics board um may not be from that

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,279
community

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,760
so i before getting into this lifting

248
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,399
piece i want to talk briefly about the

249
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,360
ways that in-person sex workers use or

250
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
desire to use technology

251
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,959
um the first is for advertising

252
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
uh the second is for vetting

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
and this is actually a safety behavior

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,680
where if i'm an in-person worker and i'm

255
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
gonna have a client i've never met

256
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,079
before um and i'm gonna meet with them

257
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,279
potentially in a hotel or in my own home

258
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
i want to make sure they are who they

259
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,440
they are they have harmed other workers

260
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,160
in the past um and that if something bad

261
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,959
were to happen there is some record of

262
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,040
who i was interacting with um so that

263
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
there can be justice

264
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
uh folks also want to use technology to

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
communicate with clients of course you

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
have an in-person interaction um but

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
just like any business you want to keep

268
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
up with your clients over time

269
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
and build that relationship

270
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
folks also want to be able to accept

271
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,839
digital payments

272
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,800
um to be able to connect with community

273
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
to get support and education and be able

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
to engage in

275
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,000
activism as well so there's both sort of

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
business purposes and then community

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,399
building purposes that folks would like

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
to be engaged in

279
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
the trouble that we find that people

280
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
face is that despite the fact that

281
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,240
they're doing legal work in

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
regulated work they're paying taxes on

283
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
that work um the technologies that they

284
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
seek to use

285
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,240
really encode american views and values

286
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,560
and impose those on

287
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
folks globally so we heard a lot of

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
reports that you know it'd be great to

289
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,079
be able to use paypal for example but

290
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
sex work is forbidden there

291
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,279
and if you go ahead and you use paper

292
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,000
you might get blocked

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
um you know someone else said you know i

294
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
had

295
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
many many followers on instagram and at

296
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,200
some point i hadn't even posted nudes or

297
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,399
anything at some point it was just

298
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
deleted

299
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,279
and so that definitely hurt my business

300
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,160
and

301
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
one participant put this experience very

302
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,680
well

303
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,519
and they said as someone who offers

304
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,399
proactive erotic services you're clearly

305
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,160
at a disadvantage in the american

306
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,120
dominated internet there's censorship

307
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
and restrictions

308
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,880
and

309
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
a key

310
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
a key theme that came up in

311
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,880
this work was that the technologies were

312
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,600
regulating not just the work right they

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,279
weren't just regulating hey you can't

314
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,959
send that particular kind of payment or

315
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,639
you can't post that particular kind of

316
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,760
content

317
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,639
they were regulating people's identities

318
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,959
so we had workers who said you know i

319
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
have one device for work i have totally

320
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
separate

321
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,519
pictures

322
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,480
emails etc i never show my face yada

323
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,920
yada

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,959
i have a phone for personal and then i

325
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,360
have a third phone and that phone is

326
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
just to be able to try to use something

327
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
like airbnb

328
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,279
and even with that level of protective

329
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,000
mechanism and i'm not using airbnb for

330
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
work i'm still getting banned from

331
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
airbnb

332
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
and we're not the first to find this um

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
vice and rolling stone have reported

334
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,040
about it and airbnb actually has a

335
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
patent

336
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
for um doing what appears to be

337
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
potentially facial recognition also some

338
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,279
scraping and some prediction to try to

339
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
figure out who are the people they don't

340
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
want on the platform this includes sex

341
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
workers folks who may have mental health

342
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
issues etc there's very little

343
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
transparency about how it's working

344
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
so people's identity is being regulated

345
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
not just their work

346
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,880
and it doesn't matter you know if

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,680
they're doing that work legally or not

348
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
similarly on instagram um sex workers

349
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
including those that are even doing work

350
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
that's legal in the us

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
may not be able to create community with

352
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,959
each other because any kind of

353
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
conversation that facilitates encourages

354
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,959
or coordinates commercial sexual

355
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,360
services of any kind is banned on

356
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,639
instagram

357
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
and as all of us know particularly

358
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
during the pandemic area but in general

359
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,240
um you know digital community is how a

360
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,399
lot of us find our communities we create

361
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,320
connection especially when they're at

362
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,120
the margins and so taking that away

363
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,639
really limits

364
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,959
people's safety and just general welfare

365
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
and it's not just sort of mainstream

366
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,279
technology that's the only kind of

367
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,680
technology that's causing harm

368
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,079
so even in the adult industry people had

369
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,639
experienced harms so

370
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,279
one person reported you know a

371
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,279
online adult platform

372
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,000
copied my ads out of newspapers and put

373
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
them on the internet without asking and

374
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
so all of a sudden they were getting

375
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,480
phone calls um from people who said oh i

376
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,320
found your ad online and they were like

377
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,959
what ad online

378
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
similarly um there are other websites

379
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,959
that have scraped

380
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
sex workers websites and made an ad

381
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
and this is both like a violation of

382
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,519
privacy

383
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,160
and in some cases they were

384
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,720
um posting services that people didn't

385
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
offer which can be quite dangerous if

386
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,160
someone comes in

387
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
thinks they're going to get one service

388
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
and that's not something you offer and

389
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
they decide to kind of push it

390
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
additionally

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
a lot of the technology in the adult

392
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,600
industry is not particularly inclusive

393
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
of the breadth of folks who are in the

394
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
sex industry um so one participant

395
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
reported that they're trans masculine

396
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
and so most of the clients and the

397
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,560
resources are set up for cis women and

398
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
so they weren't even able to advertise

399
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
on many advertising platforms because

400
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
they just were not features available to

401
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,839
describe them

402
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
and this creates um financial harm right

403
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,079
because you cannot advertise yourself

404
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,839
online

405
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,320
okay so we've talked a little bit about

406
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,480
how sex workers use or want to use

407
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
technology the kind of harms that they

408
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
can face and sort of the breadth of

409
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
those harms right

410
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
let's talk a little bit more in detail

411
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
about sex workers digital safety

412
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
uh our first research question focuses

413
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
on how sex workers define safety what

414
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,759
does it mean to be safe as a sex worker

415
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
the second is what are the major

416
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,759
barriers to staying safe online so we

417
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,079
already talked about um this kind of

418
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,320
american dominated internet and being

419
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
de-platformed right being kicked off of

420
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
platforms for your identity or for your

421
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,639
work but what are the other barriers

422
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,320
particularly particularly technical ones

423
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
and finally what are the strategies that

424
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,560
these folks are using to stay safe

425
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,519
um and as a small aside people often ask

426
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,959
me you know

427
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
how did you end up kind of studying this

428
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279
topic um and the answer is really in

429
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
kind of the first and the last question

430
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,639
that are here

431
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,279
um often in the security and privacy

432
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
community i would hear folks say well

433
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,639
if only people understood the risks then

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,320
they would do the behaviors then they

435
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
would you know use all of these tools

436
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
these pets that we need for them

437
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,399
and i started was thinking about that

438
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,839
and i was like well

439
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
i feel like often when i talk to

440
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,279
participants even those who aren't at

441
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
the margins they have a pretty good

442
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,680
sense of the risks and

443
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,759
they don't want to use these strategies

444
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,199
sometimes

445
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,360
but maybe i'm wrong

446
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
and maybe maybe it's just i'm not

447
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
talking to people who have salient

448
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
enough risks and that was really how i

449
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,119
ended up

450
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,480
coming to

451
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,599
work with

452
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,079
this community was to say well this is a

453
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,160
community with really

454
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,039
really stark risks they get no

455
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
specialized training um for safety

456
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
unlike say you know journalists who

457
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,400
might

458
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,359
um and you know what what are these

459
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
folks experiences what strategies are

460
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
they using and what can we learn um

461
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
from what they're doing and how can we

462
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,559
make it better

463
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,679
okay

464
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,919
so let's start out with what does it

465
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,320
mean to be safe

466
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
in this work what we found is that there

467
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,720
are seven forms

468
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
boundaries

469
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,799
being treated with respect

470
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,840
having access to community

471
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,240
having legal protections

472
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
and having access to privacy

473
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,080
and i'll give examples of a few of these

474
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,160
first is physical safety so one

475
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
participant said you know this means

476
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
being able to work without fear of abuse

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
or aggression

478
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,080
um

479
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,520
physical safety can intersect with other

480
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,039
you know forms of safety and all of

481
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,799
these forms of safety can intersect with

482
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,760
each other

483
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
so one participant said when speaking

484
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
about physical safety and privacy

485
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
privacy is when clients don't know my

486
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,840
name or address an unannounced visit

487
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
from a friend would be nice an

488
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,679
unannounced visit from a client would be

489
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,400
a catastrophe

490
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
when we think about financial security

491
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
right in security and privacy we often

492
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,400
think about scams but even having access

493
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
to money is a form of safety

494
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
so one person said if i had financial

495
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,720
pressure to accept jobs against my

496
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
better judgment or there was someone

497
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
demanding services i don't offer i would

498
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
be unsafe

499
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
and we'll talk about a bit later if you

500
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,039
don't have access to any kind of digital

501
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,600
payments right this also forces you to

502
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,679
use cash and carry cash in large

503
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,880
quantities

504
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
that makes you

505
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,520
both

506
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,640
at risk of assault robbery

507
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
and raises a lot of questions when you

508
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
go to pay your rent

509
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
so there's a lot of forms of financial

510
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,799
security that can intersect with digital

511
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
safety

512
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,679
finally for respect one participant said

513
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,600
you know being safe means not feeling

514
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,760
that society thinks it's normal for me

515
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
to get hurt

516
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
and as we'll see a lot of the ways that

517
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
digital platforms can operate kind of

518
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,160
embeds this concept that we do think

519
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
it's normal

520
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,280
for folks to get hurt whether it's

521
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,639
digital or physical

522
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,919
okay

523
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,160
so we know how sex workers are defining

524
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,840
safety what are the barriers to

525
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
achieving that safety

526
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
one barrier is that clients can be

527
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
aggressive or invasive

528
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
right so one person described an

529
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,400
experience

530
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
of being blackmailed um and others you

531
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,360
know other clients showing up at their

532
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
place of work looking for them

533
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,559
um and you know the participants said

534
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,360
well

535
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
it's unsettling but with the right

536
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
precautions i've learned to avoid it i'd

537
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
much rather lose money than meet someone

538
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,320
with the potential to cause problems

539
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,200
and you know one participant had sort of

540
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
a digital security experience of this

541
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
and many participants had this but i'll

542
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,840
describe this person's

543
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
story they said well my partner is a

544
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,360
photographer and photographed me a

545
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
couple of times i wasn't very smart and

546
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,559
i published my photos with his tag on a

547
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
relatively public forum

548
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
then a client of mine who was also very

549
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
fond of me which i didn't realize did

550
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
some research and figured out who my

551
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,240
boyfriend is

552
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
he found our places of business and then

553
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,840
of course knew what we do in our free

554
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,679
time what our names are

555
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,919
since then i pay very close attention to

556
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,880
what tag is on the pictures

557
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,360
so clients can be very motivated

558
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,080
to find to find workers

559
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
as we already talked about sex work

560
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
advertising websites can be predatory

561
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
and can create boundary violations as

562
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,039
well as privacy violations

563
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
and even the laws that regulate sex work

564
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,760
can create exposure risks

565
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,840
for example in germany there's a

566
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,760
requirement that websites have what's

567
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,520
called an impressum

568
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
so you must disclose the name address

569
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,000
and contact information of the person

570
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
who owns the website somewhere on the

571
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
site and this has to be the legal

572
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,080
information of this this entity

573
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,880
and so sex workers with

574
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
you know personal websites have to

575
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
either disclose this information or risk

576
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
violating the law

577
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,320
and so sex working um collectives or

578
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,400
unions in germany have actually bonded

579
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
together to create like legal entities

580
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,360
that they can put on their websites

581
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,720
instead of their own personal

582
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,360
information

583
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,919
also as i mentioned right online

584
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
platforms discriminate against sex

585
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
workers and this can create

586
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,520
numerous interpersonal risks

587
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
and as we discussed a bit these risks

588
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,880
are intersectional right so

589
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,960
lack of access as i said to digital

590
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,520
payments can reduce physical safety and

591
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
threaten financial security

592
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,760
and this is one of the reasons that

593
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
greater access to the internet can

594
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
actually improve physical safety and

595
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,400
we'll talk about that a bit more later

596
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,720
additionally right banning

597
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,480
communities from discussing sex work

598
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
online means that people don't have

599
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159
access to harm reduction information

600
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,080
whether that's about kind of public

601
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,480
health issues or how to deal with a

602
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
client who's become violent or dangerous

603
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
or just how to effectively market

604
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
yourself and

605
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,320
earn money to get out of say

606
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
homelessness

607
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,720
uh finally you know theft of ip

608
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
scraping um of this content which is

609
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
done not just by adult platforms but

610
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,400
also by uh say anti-trafficking

611
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
organizations that want to

612
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
reach out to people depending on how

613
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,520
they use that information could lead to

614
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
someone who has access to a worker's

615
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
phone finding out that they're a sex

616
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,360
worker when they didn't know that

617
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
or as i said to having clients show up

618
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,039
who think they're going to be able to

619
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,799
get a particular service

620
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,760
and they can't and they force the issue

621
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
so these kinds of you know privacy

622
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
violations digital thefts of content can

623
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,039
lead to very real physical harm

624
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,320
okay so what are the strategies that sex

625
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
workers use to stay safe

626
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,000
um what we find is um

627
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,799
a lot of kind of vetting and in-person

628
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,960
safety practices so

629
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
um covering is a technique where um you

630
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,760
will tell a friend or a colleague um you

631
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
know details about your appointment this

632
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
is who i'm going to see this is when i'm

633
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
going to see them this is how long the

634
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,960
appointment should be i'll text you

635
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
after the appointment

636
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,880
if i don't text you here's what you

637
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,640
should do

638
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,120
this is a technique that um folks who

639
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
are doing online dating

640
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
or other forms of gig work also do

641
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
but not to nearly the level of

642
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,600
prevalence that we see in our sex

643
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
working participants

644
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
um you also have vetting which i

645
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,480
described earlier um and that is also

646
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,279
extremely prevalent um among sex working

647
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,520
participants as well and is done by some

648
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
other groups like daters

649
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,360
so often uh security and privacy folks

650
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
will ask me okay what about things like

651
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,320
security and privacy settings

652
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,640
not so many people were using them

653
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
and the reason for that was as someone

654
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
said i don't think it matters if you put

655
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,960
settings on or off when i have to talk

656
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
about something i mind there isn't a

657
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,480
phone in the room and we had numerous

658
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
participants who said well i did have

659
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,960
privacy settings and then you know it

660
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
suggested a friend uh on facebook or

661
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
twitter who is a client or it had a bug

662
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,679
and then it didn't work

663
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,240
these are folks in situations where a

664
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
software bug

665
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,039
can lead to very big physical safety

666
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,960
issues they're not really willing to

667
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
risk it on oh let me try a setting

668
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,279
um ins and similarly

669
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
um folks are not necessarily using

670
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,480
security tools but the reason for this

671
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
is a bit different

672
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
as one participant put it i would gladly

673
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
do all of the above use encrypted chat

674
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,880
use vpn using cryptid email etc that

675
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,799
only really works when the customers

676
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,640
participate

677
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,880
and we heard from numerous

678
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,120
workers well it has to be cooperative

679
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
with clients right i can no more

680
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
force max planck to pay me in

681
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,760
cryptocurrency then a sex worker can

682
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,039
force their client to pay in

683
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
cryptocurrency or

684
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
converse with them over encrypted email

685
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
some folks who are at the most

686
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
privileged kind of levels of the work

687
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,159
are able to do so just like in any other

688
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,279
industry

689
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,120
but most cannot

690
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,080
and so

691
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,960
this raises questions about kind of

692
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
usability what might make it easier

693
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,880
for folks to have clients use these

694
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
tools or do we just need more widespread

695
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
awareness and adoption such that that's

696
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,159
normal we can kind of discuss um some of

697
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,400
those options in a bit but we see

698
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,559
relatively low adoption not because of

699
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,480
awareness but because of that need for

700
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,039
cooperation

701
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,440
instead what we see a lot of folks doing

702
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,840
is identity management and they're doing

703
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,279
it manually

704
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,720
so folks are trying very hard to

705
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
separate their work and personal

706
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
personas

707
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
and there

708
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,279
a lot of them are using an alias

709
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,760
and a great number of them are using

710
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,960
completely separate devices

711
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,360
but you know as one participant said

712
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,520
it's time consuming and it's annoying

713
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
it's stressful having all of these

714
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
phones and personas and things i have to

715
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,440
remember and i'm like did i mess

716
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
that up when i put this up all the time

717
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,559
and people talk about you know

718
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,919
this kind of resignation right i crap i

719
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
went and i checked my work email one

720
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,320
time on this device and now you know i

721
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,559
know that they're probably forever

722
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,520
linked because of that one mistake

723
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,679
um and folks work in this industry for

724
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,399
10 20 years right that's a long time to

725
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,159
be doing this kind of manual separation

726
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,799
um related to this manual separation

727
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,120
right people are also doing quite a lot

728
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,240
of self-censorship um so very carefully

729
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,760
curating kind of a persona for the work

730
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,080
um that is completely different from

731
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
their personal persona um can include

732
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
covering up tattoos it can include

733
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
changing hair color it can be very very

734
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,520
deep in terms of changing this persona

735
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,799
um and

736
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,960
you know some folks who work in person

737
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
never show their face in an ad ever um

738
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,000
or any kind of identifying feature a

739
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,039
mole a tattoo whatever it is um we'll

740
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,880
talk about in a bit that gets a little

741
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
harder when you're working only online

742
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,880
um to be able to do that kind of thing

743
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,919
um

744
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,039
you know

745
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,919
people also kind of delete their content

746
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,159
or destroy devices

747
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,399
and one person said you know i'm legally

748
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,159
allowed to work but i'm scared of

749
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,000
getting banned from certain countries

750
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
just for being a sex worker

751
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
so i remove all of my information

752
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,120
everything and wipe my phone before i go

753
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,679
traveling

754
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,600
as i mentioned right there is this kind

755
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,000
of resignation and regret um and a very

756
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
clear understanding of you know the

757
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,200
issues that could happen when mistakes

758
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,840
are made um as one participant said this

759
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,240
stuff could get me killed or deported

760
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,520
i'm not prepared

761
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,640
okay

762
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
so we've talked about kind of this was

763
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
the world of in-person sex work digital

764
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,919
safety experiences

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,640
prior to the copen 1910

766
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,159
what happened when the pandemic hit

767
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,480
well people couldn't do in-person sex

768
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
work for two reasons

769
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,440
the first is even in countries where sex

770
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
work is regulated or legal

771
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,039
um lock down laws and regulations meant

772
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,440
that doing work in person was no longer

773
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
legal it eventually

774
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
would return but it was not legal at the

775
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,000
time

776
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,520
um and of course covid was a risk for

777
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,919
both sex workers and their clients

778
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,200
as one participant said i'm

779
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
immunocompromised so is my housemate

780
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
neither of us are vaccinated because at

781
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,399
that time there weren't vaccines

782
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,960
available so it's too much of a risk to

783
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,600
do in-person work

784
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
and so folks shifted to online sex work

785
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
kind of end mass

786
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
and of course it wasn't just in-person

787
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
sex workers who made this shift it was

788
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,640
also folks who hadn't been working in

789
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
the sex industry

790
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
and so there was a lot of

791
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
competition all of a sudden the market

792
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,760
the online market got very saturated

793
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,440
and what people found

794
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
was that shifting to online sex work

795
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
from in-person work required a much

796
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,000
larger online footprint

797
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,960
so

798
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,320
clients were expecting a much richer

799
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,080
digital persona

800
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,279
um for online sex work so that meant um

801
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,679
being on more platforms so you could get

802
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,080
yourself more visible you could appeal

803
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,679
to clients who like liked different

804
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,039
platforms

805
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,520
it meant being more explicit

806
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,640
because folks were kind of expecting

807
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,440
the

808
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
explicitness of in-person services to

809
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,039
move online

810
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,600
and also the online industry with porn

811
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,960
with caming has a tradition of being

812
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,840
more explicit in the digital content

813
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,440
and you had to have more information out

814
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
there right they wanted to see you at

815
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,919
the cafe or know what movies you were

816
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,080
watching or really have this like

817
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,519
parasocial relationship uh with the

818
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,080
person who is doing digital sex work um

819
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
and while that can be true with

820
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
in-person work it was definitely not a

821
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,559
requirement and many folks felt you know

822
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,480
as they moved online that in order to

823
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
make any money or compete they now

824
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,960
needed to kind of be

825
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,480
online in more places and give more of

826
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
themselves

827
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,840
online whether that was more explicit

828
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,600
images more information about their

829
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,440
interests etc they had to build out a

830
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
richer

831
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,200
persona

832
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
and one person said well the worst

833
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,159
thing that i like think about is that

834
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,760
you have to have in mind that those

835
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,159
videos will be leaked and all the people

836
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,000
around you are going to get them at some

837
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
point and they will be forever on the

838
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,120
internet

839
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,760
in face to face sex work i didn't have

840
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,320
my intimacy compromised if i had

841
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,480
troubles they were going to stay there

842
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,360
with online work people will have photos

843
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,760
and videos of everything and i won't

844
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
ever be able to delete that they will

845
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,159
stay floating around forever

846
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
also if i stop doing sex work that may

847
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,960
affect me in the future too

848
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,120
so in addition to

849
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,279
um the risks we already talked about and

850
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,159
in magnification of some of them

851
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
we already know that there's this you

852
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,320
know discrimination from online

853
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,399
platforms now you're on even

854
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,960
more online platforms

855
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,039
so you have even more kind of

856
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,960
opportunity for deep platforming you

857
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
have changing rules about what can be

858
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,679
posted et cetera it magnifies the

859
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,360
relevance of this in your life because

860
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,559
you're even more online

861
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,640
there is also more risk of stalking and

862
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,559
doxxing because you're putting out more

863
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,080
information online

864
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,799
so one participant said well i i took a

865
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,039
selfie in a bathroom and i uploaded it

866
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,559
to twitter

867
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,120
and a guy went to the same

868
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,679
bathroom and posted a selfie of him in

869
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,320
that bathroom in reply to mine

870
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,559
like trying to tell me i know where you

871
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,600
are

872
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,760
those stalker things are the ones that

873
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,120
make me more scared

874
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
you also have kind of concerns around

875
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,840
the privacy of explicit personal content

876
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
most of the folks who are doing in

877
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
in-person sex work previously um

878
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
were not you know posting explicit

879
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,559
content of themselves online um that was

880
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,919
not kind of part of their marketing

881
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,159
strategy and their main concern when it

882
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,760
came to explicit content was that

883
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,080
someone might like secretly record a

884
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,120
session um but as some folks described

885
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
you know you could kind of go in and out

886
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,799
of sex work you could you know if you

887
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
needed to you could go do some work so

888
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
to reset up your ads and then go away

889
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,559
and most of the time you know you had to

890
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
be concerned about outing you know being

891
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,039
found out but mostly you could kind of

892
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,200
do this a little bit anonymously if you

893
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,159
wanted to

894
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,080
digital sex work sort of took that

895
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,679
feeling away

896
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,480
um and so one participant said obviously

897
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
there's always that concern that some of

898
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,280
my content is going to pop up on pornhub

899
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,879
that's always a risk and part of the

900
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,960
reason i prefer in-person sex work to

901
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,800
online but it's a risk you live with

902
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,599
so

903
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,359
how did this change people's safety

904
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,719
strategies

905
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,159
so as folks were doing digital sex work

906
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,560
um they started as i said right there

907
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
the platforming was an even bigger

908
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,520
problem

909
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,719
and so folks um started finding tools

910
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,800
for censorship evasion

911
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,639
so one participant said well there's

912
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,040
this website where you put a photo like

913
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,320
a photo that you want to upload to

914
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,359
instagram

915
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,839
and the website claims that it uses the

916
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,599
same machine learning that instagram

917
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,399
uses

918
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,239
and the website will tell you if this

919
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,960
picture you want to upload is too sexy

920
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
and whether you can upload it to

921
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
instagram or not

922
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
so people are using these kind of ai

923
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
tools to predict ahead of time whether

924
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
content would be censored and the reason

925
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
they want to do this is that platforms

926
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,839
have like a hierarchy of banning you

927
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,200
right so the first time you do a

928
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
violation maybe they ban you for 24

929
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,359
hours the next time you do a violation

930
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,640
it might be three days the next time

931
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
seven days next time a month

932
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
this can really take a bite out of your

933
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,680
business you lose clients etc

934
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
um because people were hyper aware of

935
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,560
the chance of being de-platformed they

936
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
also did their own client management so

937
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,400
if they had a bunch of followers on

938
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,040
instagram or twitter they were um

939
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,359
collecting those folks email or other

940
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,160
contact or making a discord so that they

941
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,800
could ensure that if or when as some

942
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,119
people described it they lost that

943
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,280
account they still were able to have

944
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,359
access to their clients

945
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,599
um we also see spencership strategies

946
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,400
right like nesting of links so tick tock

947
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
wouldn't allow you to say go directly

948
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,720
link directly to your only fans which is

949
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,800
known for being a big sex work platform

950
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,079
and so instead you're going to use a

951
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,240
link tree that links to only fans well

952
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,000
this wasn't true when we did this

953
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,599
research but now

954
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,520
tick tock will even screen out the thing

955
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
in the link tree so you have to go three

956
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
layers down there's always kind of this

957
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,400
cat and mouse game around the censorship

958
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,480
um people are also doing much more

959
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,640
advanced strategies around ip and

960
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
content protection

961
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,560
and people sometimes ask me like well we

962
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
have solutions for digital rights

963
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,200
management kind of how is this different

964
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
and i'd say it's different in two ways

965
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,839
so

966
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,760
the first is of course resourcing um so

967
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,200
you know the

968
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,280
blockbuster and warner brothers and so

969
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,760
forth they have a lot more resources to

970
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,720
do this kind of work both in terms of um

971
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
protecting it tracking it requesting

972
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,520
takedown they have a lot more authority

973
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,320
in getting people to take them seriously

974
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,040
and there's no issue of provenance no

975
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,359
one's gonna kind of question if warner

976
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,760
brothers owns you know this particular

977
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
movie

978
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
when it comes to content of yourself

979
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,680
sexual content of yourself then there's

980
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,320
a question you know is it really you

981
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,920
who's requesting takedown or is it

982
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,160
someone else and it kind of can get very

983
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,920
complicated and platforms don't always

984
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,320
want to deal with that

985
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,480
so what are folks doing they're doing

986
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,359
watermarking um so they might put the

987
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,760
name of a client on a picture they might

988
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,200
say the client's name often in a video

989
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,680
in hopes that this will prevent them

990
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,520
from wanting to spread it

991
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
um they will go

992
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,200
and use particular adult platforms that

993
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,440
do a good job of tracking the content

994
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,960
that's uploaded on them and that

995
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,640
automatically send

996
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,920
um what are called dmca takedown notices

997
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,119
which is a a regulation in the us

998
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,800
in particular

999
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
that offers copyright protection

1000
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
and so one person said well i use this

1001
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,480
particular platform because of the fact

1002
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,440
that they do these takedown notices

1003
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
other people would set up google alerts

1004
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,200
for their name and just kind of

1005
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,440
constantly track um whether their

1006
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,880
content was being uploaded

1007
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,760
um you know people also had stalking

1008
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,839
prevention strategies so there was still

1009
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,960
people who tried having like no face or

1010
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,359
adding or removing tattoos

1011
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,760
no face got very challenging and just

1012
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,359
because of the kind of competition in

1013
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,800
the market

1014
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,040
people also had a lot of strategies

1015
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,000
around uploading photos um so people

1016
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,320
would try not to take photos in easy to

1017
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
identify locations um so some person

1018
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,960
said you know i have worries because my

1019
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
room has an unusual

1020
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,359
shape and for a while i was worried that

1021
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,640
if someone went through a real estate

1022
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,240
listing and found that my room looks

1023
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,800
like that that's a concern of mine

1024
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
people talked about not

1025
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,760
filming in anywhere where you could tell

1026
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,800
what time of day it was for them

1027
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,440
posting content out of order or once

1028
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
you've already left a location so you

1029
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,520
don't have um like that concerning

1030
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,480
incident with the bathroom etc

1031
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
um and these aren't kind of just fears

1032
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,000
that people have right these were

1033
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,960
sometimes realized where someone did um

1034
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,640
look up information on a real estate

1035
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,760
website and et cetera

1036
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,640
all right so we know kind of what are

1037
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
what does it mean to be safe

1038
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,040
what are the threats how do they change

1039
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,280
when everything is online versus when

1040
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,200
it's offline

1041
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,320
what can be built right

1042
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
well

1043
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,599
these are the four kind of you know

1044
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,640
three top types of tools and the one

1045
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,200
tenant uh for how how we should be

1046
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
building them

1047
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
so we need tools that accommodate

1048
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,520
multiple personas um this is something

1049
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,000
that's been raised in the literature um

1050
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but not necessarily something i'd say

1051
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,760
that we've made amazing progress on

1052
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
at a very deep level right these are

1053
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,079
folks who need hardware level separated

1054
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,560
personas but mai wouldn't it be nice not

1055
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
to have as one participant put it so

1056
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,400
many phones

1057
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
how can we accommodate really deep

1058
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,599
de-linking of personas in a way that's

1059
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,640
usable

1060
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,079
and this would be helpful not just for

1061
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,160
sex workers but for folks who are

1062
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,200
transitioning gender identities for

1063
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,680
folks who are uh you have multiple

1064
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
people using a single device but you

1065
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,480
don't want this kind of interplay

1066
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,200
for folks who are undergoing um

1067
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
situations of domestic violence there

1068
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,599
are a lot of folks who need um you know

1069
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,319
a single device that can be multiple

1070
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,319
completely separate non-linkable

1071
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,000
personas

1072
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
that's a big need

1073
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,319
a second big need is algorithmic

1074
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,720
transparency not just privacy

1075
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
transparency and that's not to say that

1076
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,000
privacy transparency isn't very

1077
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,760
important it is

1078
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,680
algorithmic transparency is important

1079
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
too right so we have folks who are

1080
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,560
using these kinds of um

1081
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,880
you know mysterious predictive tools to

1082
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,920
try to see if content will be banned

1083
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,560
ideally platforms should be offering

1084
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,720
that right like instagram doesn't want

1085
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,280
the content that's too sexy

1086
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,880
sex workers don't want to get banned

1087
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
from instagram

1088
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,720
why don't we have pre-screening tools

1089
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
maybe it's unlikely that platforms will

1090
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,599
make those certainly something um that

1091
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,800
we can try to create as a community

1092
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
tools that better support this track

1093
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,560
tracking and production of content and

1094
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,839
particularly

1095
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,319
um kind of identification of content

1096
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,079
being able to you know have a chain of

1097
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,079
trust to say i'm really the one who took

1098
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,680
the picture i'm really the person who's

1099
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,200
in the picture and i really want it

1100
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,800
taken down from this website because

1101
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
this is not where i posted it and

1102
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
consented to it

1103
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,680
we also see um not on the slide but we

1104
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,800
also see

1105
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,200
um options for kind of better um privacy

1106
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,760
technologies as well so we had folks who

1107
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
were um

1108
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,520
going to the level of depth and this was

1109
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,920
among um not folks who had done

1110
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,760
in-person sex work in the past but among

1111
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
folks who had never done sex work but

1112
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
started doing online sex work in the

1113
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,359
pandemic one of the things we saw those

1114
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,800
folks doing

1115
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,200
was if they wanted to keep people from

1116
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,119
finding out they were doing sex work

1117
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,200
they would create a new instagram or

1118
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,480
twitter or whatever

1119
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,520
for their sex work person

1120
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,960
they would go to their personal

1121
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,160
instagram

1122
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,240
and they would you know go through the

1123
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,160
list of people they followed and the

1124
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,680
list of people all of those people

1125
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,640
followed and they would manually block

1126
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,800
all of those people on the new sex work

1127
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,960
persona and in some case this was like a

1128
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,400
thousand people that they went and

1129
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,079
manually blocked

1130
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,560
these are the kind of tools

1131
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
perhaps we can build at least we can

1132
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,040
measure how far down the tree do you

1133
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,720
need to go where is there more or less

1134
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,440
privacy gain etc

1135
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,839
but with all of these tools the key is

1136
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,000
to have their construction led by or in

1137
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,480
collaboration with the populations they

1138
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
serve

1139
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,800
right so it's very important that

1140
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,079
the communities are kind of driving the

1141
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,480
technology because they understand their

1142
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,680
use case

1143
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,240
best they understand their risks best

1144
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,359
and there's kind of no use in taking

1145
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,880
what's already

1146
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,520
a marginalizing situation and making it

1147
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,640
more disempowering or more paternalistic

1148
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,480
and that doesn't mean kind of offloading

1149
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,520
the labor right it means partnering so

1150
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
that

1151
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,000
the labor that we do to build things

1152
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,960
is useful empowering not extractive not

1153
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,760
exploitive not making things worse

1154
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
and so we want to empower communities to

1155
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,319
be able to design and build and evaluate

1156
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,640
the technology that serves them

1157
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,200
and as one participant said honestly i

1158
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,520
would say one of my biggest pet peeves

1159
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,599
is that almost all of the platforms that

1160
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,480
sex workers use as far as advertising

1161
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
and keeping ourselves safe none of them

1162
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,160
are run by sex workers or even in

1163
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
collaboration with sex workers many of

1164
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,920
them are run by older white dudes who

1165
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
are profiting off of the workers and i

1166
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,680
find that problematic in many ways

1167
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,599
so to summarize

1168
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,720
kind of key next steps in this area

1169
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,040
are to regulate against kind of

1170
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,440
globalized tech censorship of work and

1171
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,720
identity

1172
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,440
and that's affected not just sex workers

1173
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,400
but trans folks drag queens um

1174
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,359
different

1175
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,680
minority populations in the u.s we

1176
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
shouldn't have technologies that are

1177
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
regulating what identities are and are

1178
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,520
not allowed to exist

1179
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,359
and we want to be sure to incorporate

1180
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,200
and listen to marginalized voices in

1181
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,599
this kind of policy development

1182
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,960
and in developing technologies

1183
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,520
and i'll add sort of a fourth ad-lib

1184
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,000
point which is we want to start thinking

1185
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,880
about

1186
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,640
um at least i want to advocate for

1187
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,480
starting to think about safety in this

1188
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,520
kind of broad way right that it isn't

1189
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
just privacy it isn't just security it's

1190
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,000
also things like being able to set

1191
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,920
boundaries which really relates a lot to

1192
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,839
privacy but can even be

1193
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,920
you know

1194
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,760
broader than that in the kinds of

1195
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,000
boundaries we want to be able to set

1196
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,040
in having respect in having physical

1197
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,280
safety financial security this is all

1198
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,520
very intersectional and to me forms what

1199
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,280
is safety

1200
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,240
and security and privacy um digitally

1201
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,880
really underpin that um but we can think

1202
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,960
a little bit broader about the kinds of

1203
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,880
things we can create to facilitate

1204
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,200
safety that go outside maybe some of the

1205
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,400
things we traditionally think of

1206
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,720
and i'll close with a participant quote

1207
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,480
which is that i want technology that

1208
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
considers me a person

1209
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,400
and not a product but that's really

1210
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,480
asking for a lot from the anonymous

1211
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,560
virtual world

1212
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
thank you and happy to take questions or

1213
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,520
discuss now

1214
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,440
[Applause]

1215
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,520
you
