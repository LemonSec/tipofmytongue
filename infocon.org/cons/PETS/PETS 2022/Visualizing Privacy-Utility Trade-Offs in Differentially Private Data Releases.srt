00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,319
hi my name is priyanka naniyakara and

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,000
today i'm going to present our work on

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,720
visualizing privacy utility trade-offs

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,599
in differentially private data releases

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,840
in this work we designed built and

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,320
evaluated an interactive visualization

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,480
interface for data curators making

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
privacy budget decisions in a

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,759
differential privacy context

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
to begin let's say there's a data

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,080
curator at a hospital who's looking to

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
publicly release some aggregate

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
statistics about the hospital's patient

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,920
data

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
specifically they plan to release rates

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of hypertension for subgroups according

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,360
to ethnicity

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,239
age group race and zip code so for

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,239
ethnicity this means releasing the

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,160
proportion of people in the database who

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
are hispanic or latino who are diagnosed

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,840
with hypertension

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,360
and the same proportion for people in

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
the database who are not hispanic or

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
latino

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
the data curator also knows that the

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,000
release statistics will likely be used

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
to make inferences about a larger

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,199
population

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,119
so they want to also release confidence

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,200
intervals for the population proportions

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
they don't want to inadvertently release

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
statistics however that compromise

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,159
patient privacy in other words it should

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
be difficult for a future viewer of the

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
release statistics to use these

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
statistics to figure out information

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,640
about individual patients like who

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
specifically was diagnosed with

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
hypertension

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,640
for this reason the data curator decides

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
to use differential privacy in releasing

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,400
the statistics

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
they quickly encounter several

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,079
challenges which will be made more clear

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,680
after we look at the definition of

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,880
differential privacy

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
if an analysis is conducted under

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
differential privacy or dp then we

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
expect roughly similar outputs whether

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,399
or not any given individual's

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,520
information is included in the analysis

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
the strength of privacy protection is

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
determined by the privacy budget which

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
we see as epsilon in the definition

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
epsilon is a knob that can be tuned to

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,840
different levels of privacy protection

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
in practice oftentimes mechanisms

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,000
satisfy differential privacy by adding a

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
calibrated amount of random noise to the

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
underlying statistic

62
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
the amount of added noise is controlled

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
by the privacy budget

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
the data curator must choose an

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
appropriate value for the privacy budget

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
however there's no formal guidance for

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
this task which makes it especially

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
challenging

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,200
for starters in order to find an

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
appropriate balance between utility and

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
privacy the data curator needs to keep

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
track of probabilistic relationships

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,080
between epsilon utility and privacy

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
moreover when considering utility they

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,560
also need to keep in mind how a given

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
privacy budget will impact confidence

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,000
intervals that can be released

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
and because the data curator is making

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
multiple queries to the database they

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,480
might also need to split a total privacy

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
budget among queries

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
the same privacy budget applied to

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
different queries could have different

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,440
utility implications

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
further complicating this task of

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,399
setting a privacy budget

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
those are some of the challenges we kept

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
in mind when designing our interactive

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
visualization interface for data

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,760
curators setting privacy budgets

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
more specifically we had four design

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
goals for design goals one and two we

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
wanted the interface to help a data

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
curator understand relationships between

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
epsilon utility and privacy

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
for the third design goal we wanted the

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
interface to help a data curator

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
understand statistical inference under

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,560
dp

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,640
especially how sampling error and dp

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,879
noise combine in confidence intervals

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
constructed under dp

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
and fourth we wanted the interface to

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,720
help in the budget splitting task

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
we felt that if an interface could

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,959
achieve these goals the data curator

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,959
could make more informed privacy budget

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,720
decisions that take into account their

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
domain knowledge about weighing privacy

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
and utility in a particular context

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
our interface is called visualizing

112
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,478
privacy or vip for short

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,798
before we walk through vip we'll go

114
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,040
through where vip sits within the larger

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
data sharing context

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,680
the data curator makes queries to vip

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,840
and sets the privacy budget

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,080
vip then accesses the private data from

119
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
the data provider in our case that's the

120
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
hospital and vip then visualizes the

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
privacy utility trade-off under the set

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,639
privacy budget

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,960
the data curator can iteratively choose

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,520
different values for the privacy budget

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
and see the resulting privacy utility

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
trade-off to make a decision about what

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
an appropriate privacy budget is in

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
their context

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,919
once the data curator decides on a

130
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,400
privacy budget for each query vip

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
calculates privacy preserving results

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,800
that can be made available to the public

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
shown here in the diagram as a data

134
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
consumer

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,960
now we'll walk through a demo of vip and

136
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
how the data curator might use it to set

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,840
privacy budgets

138
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
here we see queries about rates of

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
hypertension across subgroups by

140
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
ethnicity age race and zip code

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,479
note that each panel on the left is

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,758
labeled with the query name

143
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
the privacy use panel on the upper right

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,199
hand corner allows the data curator to

145
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
set privacy budgets for each query

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
there's a slider for each query and

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
changing the value on the slider changes

148
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,600
the privacy budget applied to that

149
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
particular query

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,919
the data curator can also use this panel

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
to set a total privacy budget

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
then as they set privacy budgets for

153
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,039
each query the remaining budget updates

154
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,720
to show them how much of the total

155
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,600
budget is left

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
on the left there are panels depicting

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,199
the expected accuracy of each release

158
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,880
to better see what's going on in one of

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,039
these panels we'll explain expand the

160
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
panel for the ethnicity query

161
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
we see expected accuracy for each

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,520
subgroup hispanic or latino and not

163
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
hispanic or latino

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
the static black lines show the

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,759
proportions for each subgroup with no dp

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,280
noise added

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
the animated red lines or hypothetical

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
outcome plots show potential privacy

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,639
preserving releases under the privacy

170
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,199
budget set by the data curator

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
these are draws from the dp output

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
distributions

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
hypothetical outcome plots make clear to

174
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
the data curator the probabilistic

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,639
nature of making releases under dp

176
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,120
under the hypothetical outcome plots we

177
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
show quantile dot plots discretized

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,479
versions of the dp output distributions

179
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,280
since there are 25 dots in each dot plot

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
each dot represents roughly 4 chance the

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
data curator can count up the number of

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
dots in a given range and multiply by

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
four to figure out the chance that a

184
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
privacy preserving release will fall in

185
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
that range

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,240
as the data curator changes the privacy

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,479
budget applied to this query both the

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,560
hypothetical outcome plots and quantile

189
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
dot plots update

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
this is also shown in the box on the

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
lower right hand corner

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,039
the data curator is also interested in

193
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,039
releasing confidence intervals

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,400
the static gray bars represent 50 80 and

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
95 traditional confidence intervals with

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,759
no dp noise added

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
the animated blue bars are hypothetical

198
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
50 80 and 95 percent confidence

199
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680
intervals calculated under dp

200
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,199
showing both sets of confidence

201
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
intervals allows the data curator to see

202
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
how much dp noise impacts the privacy

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
preserving confidence intervals

204
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,199
on the lower right hand corner we show a

205
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,080
graph with disclosure risk and epsilon

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,599
on the curve there is a dot

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
corresponding to each query

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,599
as the data curator updates the privacy

209
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,919
budget applied to a query the queries

210
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,000
dot on the disclosure risk curve also

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
updates

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
the attack model under which this

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,360
disclosure risk is calculated assumes an

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,599
adversary has access to all records in

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,520
the database and is trying to guess

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
whether a record was included in the

217
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
analysis based on a sensitive attribute

218
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
the curve shows an upper bound on the

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
probability that the adversary guesses

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
inclusion in the analysis correctly for

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
each query

222
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,919
to evaluate the effectiveness of vip we

223
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
conducted a controlled user study with

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
16 participants

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
all participants had experience

226
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
analyzing private or sensitive data but

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
none had any dp expertise

228
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
we asked participants to complete a set

229
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
of tasks with both the spreadsheet and

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,160
vip

231
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
we counterbalanced the order of tasks

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,399
and the spreadsheet in vip

233
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,160
we designed the spreadsheet to mimic the

234
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,399
types of information data curators might

235
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
currently have when making releases

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
under dp for example participants could

237
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
set the privacy budget and the

238
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
spreadsheet would update the maximum

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
distance the privacy preserving release

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,640
would be from the query result 95 of the

241
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,959
time

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
the study's results showed that vip

243
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
helped participants more correctly

244
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
answer cdf judgment and confidence

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
interval comparison questions

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
we also found some evidence that vip may

247
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,279
help with the budget splitting task

248
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,120
let's go through examples of these three

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,000
task types details on the other tasks

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
are in our paper

251
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
cdf judgment tasks asked participants

252
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
for the probability that a privacy

253
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
preserving release would fall into a

254
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
particular range at a given privacy

255
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
budget

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
to answer this question participants

257
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
used the quantile dot plot to make quick

258
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,880
calculations

259
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
for the confidence interval comparison

260
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
task we asked participants to estimate

261
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
how many times wider a privacy

262
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,519
preserving confidence interval would be

263
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
compared to a traditional confidence

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
interval

265
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
using vip participants could compare the

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
widths of the animated confidence

267
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
intervals constructed under dp and the

268
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
static gray traditional confidence

269
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
intervals

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,000
the budget splitting task asked

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
participants to split a total privacy

272
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
budget while satisfying a set of

273
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,079
accuracy and disclosure risk

274
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,839
requirements

275
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,240
for this task participants had to rely

276
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
on both the accuracy visualizations and

277
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,160
the disclosure risk visualization

278
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
through our user study we found that vip

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,480
may help practitioners understand dp by

280
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
helping them keep track of relationships

281
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
between epsilon accuracy and privacy and

282
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,360
may also help them make relevant

283
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,240
calculations

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
looking forward we're interested in

285
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
integrating context appropriate

286
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
information into vip for instance this

287
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
might mean showing anchor points on the

288
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
privacy budget sliders so this might

289
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
mean saying something like in the past

290
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
your organization has released a similar

291
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
aggregate statistic under this privacy

292
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,959
budget

293
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,480
we also think it would be useful to

294
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
create normative frameworks for

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
evaluating dp interfaces moving forward

296
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
thank you so much for your time we're

297
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,079
looking forward to hearing any questions

298
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,920
