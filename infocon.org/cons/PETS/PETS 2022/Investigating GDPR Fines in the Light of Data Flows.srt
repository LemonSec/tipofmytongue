1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,720
good morning everyone my name is daniel

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,040
thais i am working for the institute for

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,919
internet security in gesenkee in germany

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,480
and today i will present you the paper

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
investigating gdpr fines in the light of

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,559
data flows

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
so first off let me give you a short

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
intro the gdpr is now over four years in

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
effect and while it surely impacted

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
businesses and customer related

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
processes all around the world we are

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
still well away from having privacy by

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
design or even complete data protection

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
management systems everywhere

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
often we focus just on the big players

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,280
like amazon facebook or google and while

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
they play a critical role as they have

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
tremendous amounts of users there are

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
still a lot of other institutions that

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,680
need to comply to the gdpr

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
by now we have over 1 200 imposed fines

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
and especially those violations to the

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
gdpr might give us the knowledge we need

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,879
to help institutions not just those that

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
have been fined but any to improve their

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
data protection management

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
so we wanted to look at the fines and

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
that is what we did in 856 cases

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,840
as we have a look into privacy

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
regulations we know finding privacy

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,720
preserving solutions for companies big

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,360
infrastructures and multiple interwoven

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
processes is not just a matter of

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,960
finding and applying a technical

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,159
solution like a software

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
instead it is an interdisciplinary task

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,759
that has to include yes the technical

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,640
aspects but also a wide range of

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,720
organizational challenges

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
this may include a redesign of an

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,839
existing system

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,079
as we obviously know there are at least

43
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,880
856 violations against the gdpr we want

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
to know what challenges did these

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
institutions face what did they wrong

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
but first off a quick note on related

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,280
work in this talk i just want to mention

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
that our paper relied on the enforcement

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
record by cms law

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
what they did was accumulating the files

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,360
imposed by the data protection

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,399
authorities

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,800
which resulted in a list of files with a

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,040
summary about what happened the

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,680
controller or processor the general type

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
of violation and a list of related

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
articles of the gdpr as well as some

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
metadata

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,720
so here is what we did we developed a

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,400
systemization scheme to categorize the

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
gdpr files of the enforcement trigger

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
for extended analysis

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,319
the scheme covers a detailed

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,959
categorization of the find issue why

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,599
dpas investigated it and whether the

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,840
issue was rooted in organizational or

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,480
technical problems

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,959
based on the data lifecycle model we

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
group the analyzed files into different

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
processing phases

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
and finally we analyze which gdpr

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
principles are commonly infringed in the

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,519
analyzed cases

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
we do so by performing a word frequency

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,800
analysis and manipulate stems to the

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
definitions given in article 4 of the

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,800
gdpr

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
so let me give you a short overview over

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
the data in about 3 years we have a

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,440
total sum of fines of around 1.8 billion

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
euro and as you can see amazon has a

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
huge share with about 40 percent

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
the mean lies around 2.1 million euro

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,599
and the lowest fine is in fact zero euro

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,239
now that we have our data we want a more

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
detailed coding on what was find aka the

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,959
violations

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,440
so we started an iterative coding

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,000
process based on the violations found in

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,640
the summary and the type of violation

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,239
that was given by the enforcement

92
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,680
tracker

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,159
let me give you an example for any case

94
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,599
starting with an insufficient

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,239
fulfillment of data subject rights we

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,480
refined the category to describe which

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
data subject rights were violated for

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
example the right to access or erasure

99
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,799
these refined categories give us more

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
information about why an institution has

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,239
been fined

102
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
rather than just a rough direction

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,200
here you see the distribution of

104
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,760
violations by the top level categories

105
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
we have the most common violation with

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,279
over 750 cases with the unauthorized

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,519
access followed by insufficient security

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
measures with just half as much

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
we even have almost 100 cases where

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
institutions failed to report a data

111
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
breach or to cooperate with a dpa and

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
more than 150 cases that failed to

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
accommodate the information obligations

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,320
set by the gdbr

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
as you already know we just analyzed 856

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
cases yet we have more than double the

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,120
violations so it's safe to say one

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
violation comes rarely alone

119
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
moreover 58 have an underlying technical

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,919
problem and about 79

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,880
can be related to issues in organization

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,120
so obviously we have an overlap of

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
technical and organizational issues

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
but how are these problems reflected in

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,759
fines although we have over 300 files

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,479
more related to organizational fines the

127
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
amount of files is about 25 percent

128
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,199
lower than for files of technical origin

129
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,520
we all wish our private data was not

130
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
leaked we want to say keep your secrets

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,440
but we already know that did not work so

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,280
let's have a look at the causes for

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,000
investigations

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,479
there are basically four groups that may

135
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,039
trigger an investigation one the data

136
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,440
controller two a third party that is

137
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,320
involved in handling of personal data

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
three a data subject and four any dpa

139
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,520
but most likely a local dpa

140
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,840
unfortunately we can reliably assign

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,479
only 29 of the violations to one of the

142
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,800
previously mentioned groups

143
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,199
data publication seems to be the reason

144
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,199
number one for investigations with a

145
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,000
share of 45 percent

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,919
moreover just 12 percent of the

147
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,000
investigations can be tracked back to a

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
report by the data controller

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
this low number may be an indicator to a

150
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,000
problem with the reporting requirements

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,080
as you remember unauthorized access and

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,160
insufficient security measures were the

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120
most violated top level categories

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
here we have the most fined categories

155
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
although they may not be the only reason

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,199
for a fine

157
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,560
48 of all fights included processing of

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
personal data without legal basis

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
moreover 26 percent of all cases

160
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,120
included an unauthorized disclosure

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
which ranged from a disclosure to the

162
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,840
wrong person up to publicly distributing

163
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
data on websites

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
and last but definitely not least 21

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
percent of the fights included a failure

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
to fulfill data subject rights like

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
granting access to the processed

168
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
personal data

169
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,319
so let's head on to the data lifecycle

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
according to the abstract personal data

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
lifecycle model we have a total of 8

172
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,840
phases personal data can go through

173
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,280
these phases are initiation collection

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
retention access disclosure

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
usage review and destruction

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
we applied our codes respectively the

177
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
categories to these phases

178
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
let me give you an example

179
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
the initiation phase describes the

180
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,319
development of a processing plan which

181
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,479
includes the definition of the purpose

182
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
and how personal data is collected and

183
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680
processed this is the phase where

184
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,919
privacy by design and default are

185
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,560
applied which is why we attributed the

186
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,440
categories privacy unfriendly design and

187
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,120
the privacy policy to this phase

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
according to our attribution the

189
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,039
collection phase holds the largest

190
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,840
number of files moreover this phase is

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,319
the only where we found more files being

192
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
rooted in organizational issues than

193
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
technical

194
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,879
in the retention access and usage phase

195
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,879
we identified a higher number of

196
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,560
technical issues compared to

197
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
organizational violations

198
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
but let's get into further detail with

199
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,919
word frequency analysis

200
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,080
we already know we have more technical

201
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
issues than organizational when it comes

202
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,039
to accessing personal data

203
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
thus following our word frequency

204
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,599
analysis of all fine summaries showed

205
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
access to be clearly the most frequent

206
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,880
world as it appeared 67 percent more

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
often than the second most frequent word

208
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
use

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
just a side note on the process of the

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,320
analysis we use word stamps like shown

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
here in order to ensure we catch the

212
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
meaning and don't build up piles of

213
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
words with the same meaning

214
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
so let's have a more in-depth look at

215
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
axis the two main issues that correlate

216
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
to axis are in fact that too much data

217
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,040
was disclosed

218
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
the problems here are that personal data

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
is accessible without any authentication

220
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,800
procedure in place as well as flawed

221
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
access management

222
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,600
moreover there are cases of unnecessary

223
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
access through third parties

224
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
on the other hand not enough data was

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
disclosed to be more precise access

226
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,600
relates to the failure to comply with

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
access requests by data subjects to

228
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
their personal data as well as an

229
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
insufficiently accessible privacy policy

230
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
or information regarding the processing

231
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
of personal data

232
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
our last step of analysis was to map the

233
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
word stems we extracted to the

234
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,519
definitions in article 4 of the gdpr

235
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
and i would like to share some of the

236
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,320
interesting findings with you here

237
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
for restriction we have found adequate

238
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
appropriate and sufficient respectively

239
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
the word stems which indicate the fined

240
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,000
institutions tried to fulfill the

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
requirements but were not able to

242
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
for controller we have found enough

243
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
occasions of vodafone to be listed

244
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
individually as opposed to more general

245
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,839
terms like bank or

246
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,600
hospital speaking of hospital we found

247
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
at least 18 percent of personal data to

248
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
be attributed to the well-being of an

249
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
individual which exceeds the most

250
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,959
frequent word stem name by two percent

251
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
to end this presentation i would like to

252
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
give you our conclusions

253
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
the dpas issue most fines for reason of

254
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
an organizational origin

255
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
we revealed area of cooperative research

256
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
security and legal as 409 fines are

257
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
related to processing data without a

258
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
legal basis

259
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
moreover there is a need for rigorous

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
data protection management and privacy

261
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
by design

262
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
we also showed that a high number of

263
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
files is attributed to the early phases

264
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,240
of data processing which indicates

265
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,959
widespread data processing issues

266
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
finally many violations are related to

267
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
issues in access control management

268
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,839
there is a need for refined

269
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,720
organizational processes and continuous

270
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,440
monitoring to avoid unwanted data

271
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
disclosures

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
if you have questions feel free to ask

273
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,880
them here or after the session stay safe

274
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
and thank you very much
