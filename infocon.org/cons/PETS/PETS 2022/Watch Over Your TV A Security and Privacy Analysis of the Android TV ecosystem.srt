00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,600
hello my name is marco tilleria and i'll

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,759
be presenting this paper watch over your

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,320
tv a security and privacy analysis of

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,719
the android tv ecosystem this is joint

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
war with jorge vlasko from royal

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
holloway

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
i bet that most of you have one of these

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,119
devices in your home either a built-in

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,560
smart tv or an ott device like an amazon

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
fire stick

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
and if you are from the us the chances

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
that you are reachable by connected tv

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
advertisers goes up to 90 percent

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
the connected tv landscape has

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
experienced an explosive growth in the

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,559
last couple of years

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,960
the popularity of streaming services

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
affordable prices and enhanced user

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
experience has contributed to the wide

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,600
adoption of smart tvs

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,239
smart tv rely on channel or apps to

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
deliver streaming content over the

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,280
internet

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
this allowed users

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
to interact with the app unlike

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
traditional televisions where the

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
experience was mostly static now there

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,600
are two important works that have

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,479
recently analyzed smart tv platforms in

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,680
terms of security and privacy this works

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,119
mainly focus on roku and fire tv

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
while in this world we analyze the

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
android tv platform so

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
why is that

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
now android tv is highly compatible with

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
other android platforms

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
in particular with the home assistant

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,119
and google also claims that there are

39
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,640
110 million active smart tv devices and

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
more than 10 000 tv apps in the play

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
store

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,439
the android tv platform has experienced

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,720
an 81

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,200
increase of billion per time since 2020

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
and is available across many brands now

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
tv apps are similar to mobile apps in

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
the sense that both are based on android

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
so they share the same structure and

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,840
developers use the same tools to build

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
the apps

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
but tv apps also present unique

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,920
characteristics such as the data they

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,040
handle

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,760
the library they use one example is the

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
the leanback library

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
and the user experience

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,200
now tv apps must declare a tv activity

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
in the manifest and other custom

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
configurations

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
so then google uses this information to

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
enable one app in the android tv play

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
store

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
there are also different types of tv

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
apps as we can see in the screen on the

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
top we can see popular streaming apps

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
but lower we also see many general

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,959
purpose apps

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
and in particular fitness and education

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
apps have tripled in the last two years

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
in the play store so this is the first

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
important difference that we want to

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
highlight in android tv when an user

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
wants to install one app

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
the information is almost non-existent

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
they only have available a short

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
description and that's it

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
and considering that tv apps have

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
similar capabilities to mobile apps we

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
expect similar threats however there is

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
no way to read permissions user reviews

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
last update or even the privacy policy

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
in android tv and this is a big

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
difference with the android mobile

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
platform and with this in mind we

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
decided to do a systematic analysis of

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
this ecosystem to better understand

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,239
these threats in android tv and to

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,159
understand the difference with the

89
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,760
mobile platform

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
we did a systematic analysis of tv apps

91
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
that include information flows inter

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
device communication external

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
dependencies and bad development

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
practices so first we collected around

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
5000 tv apps from the play store and

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
apk mirror and we analyzed the

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
repository metadata

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,239
we also use static analysis to analyze

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
permissions libraries information flows

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,319
and more

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
all of these complemented by reverse

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
engineering and manual analysis of

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
selected cases we also run a traffic

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
analysis experiment using a small subset

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
of 65 popular streaming apps

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
in this experiment we execute the tv and

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
mobile version of the apps then we

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,400
analyze the decrypted network traces

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
so a couple of things to mention

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
android tv is more limited than android

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,479
for smartphones for instance it's not

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,680
possible to install custom certificates

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
so we relied on instrumentation to force

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
the apps to use our men in the middle

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
certificate

116
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
the instrumentation also removes

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
certificate pinning checks and write a

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,240
couple of lines to log

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,199
potential identifiers and sensitive data

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
before recompiling the app

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
regarding the execution

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,880
we log in on each app before exploring

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,639
to get better results

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,039
the exploration time is around 15

125
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,240
minutes

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
and after that we search for any leak

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
identifier or sensitive data in the

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
network traces

129
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,680
now time for the results now

130
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
due to time limitation it is not

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
possible to show all our findings here

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
so i encourage the audience to read the

133
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
paper for a better understanding of the

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
problems we found in android tv

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,039
our static analysis results show

136
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,840
potential sensitive data exfication in

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
more than 70 percent of the apps

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
if we look only at tv streaming apps

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
this number goes up

140
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,210
to 83 percent

141
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,400
[Music]

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
most sources

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,720
are reading static identifiers

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
in contrast sources from google ads

145
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
identifier library which provide

146
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,000
resettable identifiers are almost

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319
non-existent

148
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
the results also show many streaming

149
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
libraries potentially collecting

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
sensitive data sign libraries even

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
mention in their website their invasive

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
behavior such as the collection of

153
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
installed applications and constantly

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
scanning networks

155
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
one example is bisbee that claims the

156
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,080
position of a graph of available devices

157
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,800
across millions of homes in which they

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,039
can distinguish between private homes

159
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
and public places

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
these results show potential invasive

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
behavior now the question is can we

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
confirm this finding with our traffic

163
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
analysis experiment

164
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
and the answer to a large extent is a

165
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
yes

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,240
we can see in this slide the figure of

167
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
contacted domains and traffic analysis

168
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,000
results

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
so we first classified traffic to first

170
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,520
party

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
content delivery networks and trackers

172
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
and it is already clear from the plot

173
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,840
that traffic to trackers are quite

174
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
prevalent

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
with this classification in mind we

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
consider that a data link represent a

177
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
privacy issue if the destination is a

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
tracker

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
and we were able to find that trackers

180
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,319
are collecting most types of sensitive

181
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
data from static identifiers to viewing

182
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,479
history

183
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,800
in this capture we can see the title of

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
a program being leaked to a well-known

185
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
tracker

186
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
and not only the title other metadata

187
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
such as the description and the category

188
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
are leaked alongside the title

189
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
the results of static analysis and

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
dynamic analysis complement each other

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
for instance for detecting media

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
metadata like viewing history the

193
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
dynamic analysis was more effective

194
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
this is probably because the developers

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,400
are using libraries to manage streaming

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
content and it's very difficult to have

197
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
a complete list of sources for static

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
analysis

199
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,759
but for other types of sensitive data

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
like location the static analysis gave

201
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,720
better results

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,599
in general static analysis results gave

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
us a guide on what apps should we

204
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
explore and what type of data should we

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
look in the traces

206
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
our results show that multiple cases of

207
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
trackers collecting static identifiers

208
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
and sensitive data

209
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,560
we consider that this is problematic

210
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
because the user has no option to read

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,199
the privacy policy in android tv before

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
installing an app

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
this clearly showed that there is a lot

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,519
to do regarding user privacy in android

215
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,479
tv

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,719
we note difference when analyzing the

217
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,120
mobile and tv version of popular apps

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,080
for instance mobile apps receives more

219
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
frequent updates

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
looking at the information flows we

221
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
found different sources

222
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
and when analyzing permissions and

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
libraries there are also many different

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,680
and most notably tv apps contact

225
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
different domains than mobile apps from

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
trackers to content delivery networks

227
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,279
this shows that even though both

228
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
versions are android apps their behavior

229
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
and configuration are quite different we

230
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,839
also note a significant degradation of

231
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
user rating for the tv version as seen

232
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
in this table

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
the android tv documentation mentioned

234
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,440
that is very easy to port mobile apps to

235
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
android tv

236
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
however it is clear that it's not that

237
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
easy to publish good quality apps

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
during our different evaluations we

239
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,920
found many cases of permission

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
inconsistencies non-existent

241
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,800
functionalities and a lot of complaint

242
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,519
in the play store about user experience

243
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
and user interface as as a result of

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
buggy apps

245
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,399
this showed that developers are not

246
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
making the effort to maintain good

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
quality apps and google is failing to

248
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
provide

249
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
a proper guidance

250
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,240
to conclude trackers are collecting all

251
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
sorts of data that goes from viewing

252
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
history to static identifiers

253
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,720
and this

254
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,959
not only means the ability to track

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,680
behavior across apps but also means that

256
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
the new google policy of restricting

257
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,839
advertising ids will have limited impact

258
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
in the android tv ecosystem

259
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,200
also porting mobile apps to android tv

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
generates problems that are not being

261
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
considered properly neither by the

262
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
developers nor by google

263
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,079
as a recommendation to improve the

264
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,959
ecosystem we suggest a more privacy

265
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,600
aware user interface that allows android

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,560
tv users to review permissions in

267
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,519
privacy policy before installing apps

268
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,000
and better guidelines for tv apps

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
developers port mobile apps to android

270
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
tv

271
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
thank you very much you can find the

272
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,440
link of the repository in the slide and

273
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,399
now i'm open to questions
