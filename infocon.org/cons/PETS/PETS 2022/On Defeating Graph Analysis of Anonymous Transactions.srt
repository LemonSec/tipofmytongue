hello everyone my name is avi wu and i'm

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,120
going to talk about defeating graph

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
analysis of anonymous transactions

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,000
this is a joint work with christophe

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,719
egger russell ly victoria gronge and

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,960
huffa yin

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
our work is about ring-based anonymous

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,480
transactions

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,199
in a ring-based anonymous transaction a

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,439
user signs a transaction without

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,760
revealing its identity

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
this is done by forming an ad hoc group

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
with some other users and proving that

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
designer itself belongs to the group

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,000
for historical reason this group is also

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,559
called a ring and those other users in

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,280
the ring are called the decoys

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,680
in this case the public only knows that

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,000
the transaction is signed by one of the

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,399
ring members but they don't know who the

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,320
actual signer is

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
given this mechanism a natural question

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
would be how these rings should be

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
sampled which is the central focus of

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
our work

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
to formalize this concept in a previous

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
work grange adult introduced the notion

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,760
of ring samplers

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,320
let u be the set of all users a ring

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,560
sampler is a probabilistic polynomial

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,439
time algorithm which inputs assign a i

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,640
in u and outputs around r such that r is

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,439
in r and r is a subset of u

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,520
we see that the real signer i is hidden

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,439
within the rank r

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,159
typically for efficiency reason we want

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
the ring size to be much smaller than

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
the number of users

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
the authors further introduced a class

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
of ring samplers called the partitioning

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,360
samplers a partitioning sampler will

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
partition the set of all users into

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
chunks then samples some number k

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
decodes uniformly randomly from the

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,880
chunk that designer belongs to

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
the authors showed that the partitioning

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
samplers achieve near optimal local

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,799
anonymity where local here refers to

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
anonymity at any individual time

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,320
moreover a partitioning sampler has the

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
advantage that it is simple to implement

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
in practice

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
given this background we are therefore

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
interested in further investigating the

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
partitioning samplers

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,319
specifically we ask what if we consider

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,040
the global anonymity of rank samplers

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
whereby global we mean the anonymity

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
throughout time

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
for this we define the graph based

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,239
anonymity of ring samplers that is how

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
well can a ring sampler resist the

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,879
anonymization at text that are based on

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,200
graph analyzing the ring memberships of

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
all the transactions in the history

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
next with this global anonymity measure

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
in mind we further ask what is the ring

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
size that one should pack

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
we know that on the one hand anonymity

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
increases with the ring size but on the

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
other hand efficiency decreases with the

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,959
ring size

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
therefore we want to know what is a good

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
middle ground and this will be the

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
question that we attempt to answer

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
to formalize our question we define the

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,680
notion of transaction graphs which is a

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
graph representation of the ring

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
memberships of transactions

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,159
a transaction graph is a bipartite graph

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
g represented by the tuple u r and e

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,319
where u is the set of uses r is the set

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
of rings and e is the set of edges

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,040
representing ring memberships where an

85
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
edge i j means that user i is in ring j

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
on the right i give an example

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
transaction graph with five uses and

88
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,440
three rings and for example the edges

89
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
one one and two one here means that

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
users 1 and 2 are members of ring 1.

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
in a transaction graph there must exist

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
at least one maximum matching and

93
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,319
without loss of generality we can assume

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,440
that all edges ii are in the graph

95
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
as an example here i have highlighted

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
one maximum matching in red

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
the reason that there must exist a

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
maximum matching is that a maximum

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
matching here has the semantic meaning

100
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,720
that it represents a possible signer

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
signature assignment

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,879
that is for example the maximum matching

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,519
that is in red now says that user 1 is

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
the real signer of ring 1 and user 2 is

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,439
the real sign of rank 2 and so on

106
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,200
and now i'm showing another maximum

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
matching and this one says that user 2

108
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,600
is the real center of rank 1 and so on

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
now to model graph based the

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,600
anonymization attacks we introduce the

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
following security gain

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
in the experiment here gsm inputs the

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
set of uses and the number of rings and

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
outputs a transaction graph g together

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
with a maximum matching m in g which

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
represents the true signal synaptic

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
assignment

118
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,440
note that the randomness of the output

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
graph g depends on the rank sampler that

120
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
is used

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,720
given the graph g diversity wins if it

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,440
can output an edge in g which is also in

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,919
m that is it guesses the real sign of a

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,840
ring

125
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
correctly with this experiment now our

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
goal is to look for a ring size which

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
can lead to a low winning probability

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,479
for the adversary in this experiment

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,639
which also means a high anonymity for

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
the users under graph based attacks

131
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,639
so what can a graph analyzing adversary

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
do with a transaction graph g

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
to answer this we consider the dm

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,680
decomposition which decomposes g into

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
two parts the first part is called the

136
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
core of g equals u r e prime which is a

137
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,840
sub graph of g and the e prime here is

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
the union of all the maximum matchings

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
in g and the second part is just

140
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
everything else

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
for example in this transaction graph on

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,759
the right the red edges are all the

143
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,720
edges in call g

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
now a graph-based de-anonymization act

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
tag is simply to rule out the edges that

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,199
are not in call g which are also the

147
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
edges that cannot correspond to a true

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
sinus lecture assignment

149
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,600
for example on the right we see that the

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
edges 1 3 and 2 3 they are not in call g

151
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
and therefore we conclude that user 3

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
must have been the real signer of rank

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,319
3.

154
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,479
from this we can see that if g does not

155
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,639
equal to call g then some users will

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,880
have decreased anonymity in the sense

157
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
that their effective ring size is

158
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,120
reduced

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
our first result is on relating the

160
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
security game that we just introduced

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
and called g

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
for this consider the trivial attack

163
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
where the adversary the anonymizes

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
assigner by random guessing with winning

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,479
probability being equal to 1 over k plus

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
1 and k here is the number of decoys

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,039
we proved that this trivial attack is

168
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
optimal when using the partitioning

169
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
samples and g equals call g in the sense

170
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
that the winning probability of the

171
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
adversary is upper bounded by the

172
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,639
probability of g not equal to call g

173
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,360
plus the fraction 1 over k plus 1.

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,479
in other words if g must equal call g

175
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
then the adversary cannot do anything

176
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,960
better than random guessing

177
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
with this inequality to upbound the

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
adversary's winning probability it

179
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,319
remains to upon the probability of g not

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
equal to call g

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
we achieve this by proving some

182
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,160
relations about graphs and also

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
proposing two conjectures which i'm

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,759
going to walk through next

185
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
first we map the problem of a

186
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,840
transaction graph to that of a directed

187
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,039
graph

188
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,520
given the transaction graph g we define

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
the induced directed graph of g and is

190
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,199
denoted by id of g here

191
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
the induced directed graph has the same

192
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,160
edges as the original graph g but with

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
the edges being reinterpreted as

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
directed edges and the self edges are

195
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,680
removed

196
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,759
on the right i'm showing an example of a

197
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,680
transaction graph and its induced

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
directed graph

199
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
and then based on some results in the

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,160
graph theory literature we proved that

201
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,639
first the probability of g not equal to

202
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
chord g is the greatest when the number

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
of uses equals the number of rings and

204
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
second this probability is upper bounded

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
by the probability that the induced

206
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,800
directed graph of g is not strongly

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,759
connected and therefore from here on our

208
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,680
problem becomes to upbound this

209
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,919
probability that the induced directed

210
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
graph is not strongly connected

211
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
now consider the induced directed graph

212
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
of a partitioning sampler

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
record that a partitioning sampler would

214
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
sample some k decals uniformly randomly

215
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,520
within the chunk we observe that in the

216
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,840
induced directed graph of a chunk each

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,719
of the notes has in degree k and the k

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
incoming notes are sampled uniformly

219
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
randomly from the other notes

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
in the literature of random graph theory

221
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
graphs with this type of randomness is

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
called the k in degree regular random

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
directed graphs and is denoted by curly

224
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,279
g rag here

225
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
and therefore now we ask what is the

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
probability that this type of random

227
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
directed graph is strongly connected

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,920
unfortunately this problem seems to be

229
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
quite hard and has been opened in the

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
math literature for over 40 years

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
already and we were also unable to solve

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
it

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,839
to circumvent this issue we turn our eye

234
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
to another type of random directed graph

235
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
called the binomial random directed

236
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
graphs and is denoted by curly g being

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
here

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
in this type of random graph each of the

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
possible directed edges would exist in

240
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
the graph with some probability p

241
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,720
independently

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
is called binomial random graph because

243
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
the in degree of each of the nodes here

244
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,160
follows the binomial distribution

245
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
to relate the distributions g rec and g

246
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,760
bean we propose our first conjecture

247
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
which says that for fixed number of

248
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
nodes n and the probability p being

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
equal to this fraction shown here the

250
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,160
probability that a directed graph g is

251
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
not strongly connected when sampled

252
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,279
under g reg is upper bounded by that

253
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,080
when sampled on the g bean

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
although we couldn't formally prove this

255
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
relation we note that this is

256
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,959
intuitively true since for all graphs in

257
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
the support of g rec each node must be

258
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
weakly connected to k other nodes while

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
this is not the case for graphs in the

260
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,480
support of g bean

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
we also conducted empirical experiment

262
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
and the result shows that this

263
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
conjecture holds for all graph size

264
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
greater than or equal to 16 and for all

265
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
values of case tested

266
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
taking this conjecture now our task is

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
to look for an upper bound for this

268
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
probability that g is not strongly

269
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
connected when sampled under g bean

270
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,399
for this we make use of an existing

271
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
result on the limit of this probability

272
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,839
when the graph size n tends to infinity

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,680
we tweaked the formula of this limit a

274
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
bit and obtained our second conjecture

275
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,000
shown here which is a closed form upper

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
bound for the probability that we want

277
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
again we conducted empirical experiment

278
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
for this relation and same as the

279
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
previous one this conjecture also holds

280
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
for all graph size greater than or equal

281
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
to 16 and for all values of case tested

282
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
now we can put everything together

283
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
recall that we want to up about the

284
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,839
probability of g not equal to call g

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
we related this to the strong

286
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
connectivity of the induced directed

287
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
graph of g

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
and for a partitioning sampler the

289
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,880
distribution of its induced directed

290
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
graph follows the distribution of the

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
regular random directed graphs

292
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
then using the two conjectures that we

293
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,760
introduced we obtained closed form upper

294
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
bound for our probability of interest

295
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
finally going back to our security game

296
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,760
which is also our global anonymity

297
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,839
measure of rank samplers

298
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,440
we want to upbound the winning

299
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,160
probability of the adversary and earlier

300
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120
on we had this relation here

301
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,519
if we set the probability of g not equal

302
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
to call g to be at most this fraction

303
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,880
here then we see that a graph analyzing

304
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,000
adversary is at most twice as successful

305
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
as with the trivial attack

306
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,240
in order for this to hold if we assume

307
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,399
the two conjectures then using our

308
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,200
results we can derive that it suffices

309
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
to set the number of decoys k to satisfy

310
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
this inequality here which is just

311
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
logarithmic in the total number of users

312
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
and we say that with this number k it

313
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
suffices to resist graph based

314
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,399
anonymization attacks

315
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
here is a summary of this talk and also

316
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,040
the link and a qr code to the e-print of

317
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,319
our work thank you very much
