00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,760
hello i'm ali assad on behalf of my team

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,600
i thank you for joining the presentation

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,080
on our work titled privacy scout

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,760
assessing vulnerability to shoulder

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,120
surfing on mobile devices

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,799
previous work showed that shoulder

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
surfing the act of observing content

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,800
shown on device screen without users

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
consent has a serious impact on users

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
privacy security and even safety

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
consequently a large body of research

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
has investigated means to understand and

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
mitigate this event

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,559
in this work we present privacy scout a

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,399
novel method that predicts shoulder

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,399
surfing risk based on the visual

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,559
features extracted from the observer's

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,399
face as captured by the front-facing

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
camera

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,879
to that end we considered in our study

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,280
design two independent variables the

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
shoulder surface location relative to

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
the phone and the content type

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
to overcome the limited field of view of

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,360
the front-facing camera in most of the

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
market available smartphones we attached

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
a wide angle camera with this attachment

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,400
both cameras had an identical angle

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
starting with the observer's location as

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
seen here we placed the phone on a table

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
simulating the height of a phone and use

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
of a sitting user we specified four

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,320
distances

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
15 150 and 200 centimeters from the

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
phone and three angles on the y-axis

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,920
zero front facing 30 and 60 degrees

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,240
resulting in 12 different locations we

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159
used a rotating prototype to control the

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,479
y-axis rotation of the phone

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
regarding the content we selected the

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,000
sensitive content types that are

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,079
reported to be shoulder served according

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
to a previous survey the first content

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,040
type is the pins we recorded 12

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
different videos of pin entry with no

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,399
repeated digits

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,479
we selected 12 texts from an available

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,320
data set similar to the font of a

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
messaging application

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,079
finally 12 photos were also selected

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,320
from an available data set all contained

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
between two and four people

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
the participants or the observer were

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
only asked to move between the four

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
different points and the order of

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
locations was counter balanced using

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
latin square design the content and the

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
angle of the phone was controlled by the

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
experimenter

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
16 people voluntarily participated in

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,239
our study 15 males and one female

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,200
age

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,319
ranged between 22 and 34 and height

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,080
between 169 and 202 centimeters

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
all participants had a normal or

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
corrected to normal vision

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
the contributions of our work are

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
twofold first we present the first

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,760
detailed analysis on the success of

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,360
shoulder surfing beyond user

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
authentication against commonly attacked

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
content types

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,239
pin photo and text on mobile devices

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,800
our fine grained analysis for distances

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
versus three observation angles are

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,360
based on 16 participant user study and

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
simulated shoulder surfing attacks in

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
the lab which is in line with other

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
shoulder surfing studies

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
second we present privacy scout a novel

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
computational method that leverages

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
visual features extracted from an image

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,599
of the potential attacker to then

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
regress a score that represents the

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
shoulder surfing risk

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
let's have a look at the first

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
contribution

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
we discuss our results for the different

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
types that we analyzed starting with the

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,560
pins

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
in the pin condition study participants

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
that played the role of an attacker were

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
asked to reproduce the pin that was

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
shown on the screen at different

95
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
distances and viewing angles

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,519
we then use the edit distance or

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,680
livenstein distance to compare the

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
actual ground truth pin and the one

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,159
observed by the study participants it's

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
a distance metric between two input

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,239
strings that associates a cost

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,799
to a single character edit insertion

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
deletion substitutions and also

104
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,799
transposition

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
as such the added distance is a metric

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
that indicates how close the pin

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,319
observed by the attacker is to the

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
actual one a score of zero indicates

109
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
that the two pins are identical where

110
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,799
while a score of 4

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,040
the pins length means the attacker

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
cannot observe any of the digits our

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,319
main finding is that pins are vulnerable

114
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
independent of distance or observation

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,000
angles

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
our analysis did not reveal any

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
statistically significant results

118
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,680
neither of the main effects of distance

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,399
angle or interaction

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
to assess the vulnerability of photos

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
during shoulder surfing attacks on

122
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
mobile devices we calculated five

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
different evaluation metrics success

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
rate indoors versus outdoors success

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
rate of correctly counting people in the

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
photo success rate of recognizing the

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,479
facial expressions in the photo and the

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,240
success rate of fully or partially

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
recognizing the activity in the photo

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
there was no intense incentive to lie as

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
there was no compensation or reward to

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
do so

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,880
using a two-way repeated measures anova

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
we found that the influence of distance

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
on success rate facial expressions and

136
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,199
success rate activity was statistically

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,759
significant

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
the angle played a significant role on

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,919
success rate count people and success

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
looking at the interaction effects

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
between distance and angle we did not

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
find any statistically significant

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
influence

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
we assess the vulnerability to shoulder

152
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
these were our main findings from our

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
studies for detailed analyses and

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
additional results please refer to our

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
paper

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
our second contribution is privacy scout

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
a novel computational method that

158
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
leverages visual features extracted from

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
an image of the potential attacker to

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
then regress a score that represents the

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
shoulder surfing risk

162
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
we use the same images from our data

163
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
collection study in which we collected

164
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
images of the attackers using two

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,960
devices

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
a mobile phone and a gopro with a wide

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,639
angle camera

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
here is an example of the collected

169
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
images

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,039
what does our privacy scout actually do

171
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
using different combinations of the

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
image features we mentioned we train

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
support vector regressors to request a

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
shoulder surfing risk assessment score

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
we did this for the two conditions that

176
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
we saw the distance and angle played a

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
significant role for the photos and

178
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,479
textural content

179
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
however given the time constraint i will

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
only cover one example which is the

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,319
photos

182
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,199
based on the data from our user study we

183
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,960
derive each score as a sum of the

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
individual characteristics for each

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
content for instance for the photos the

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
score is calculated as the success rate

187
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,319
indoors versus outdoors the success rate

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,240
of counting people the success rate of

189
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,160
recognizing the facial expressions and

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
the success rate of recognizing the

191
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,639
activities

192
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
so how well does such a model work we

193
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,080
evaluated our models and reported the

194
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,400
mean absolute error which is commonly

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
used in regression tasks

196
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,400
all the evaluation results are from

197
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
leave one subject out cross validation

198
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
concretely we report results for one of

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
the two use cases the photos

200
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
we compared our method with three naive

201
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
bayes lines the knife constant is a

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,520
method that would always report a high

203
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
shoulder surfing risk if a second face

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
is detected using the front facing

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
camera as seen from the evaluation

206
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,520
results any method either ones that use

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
more complex feature sets

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
like using all features or even simple

209
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
ones that only use the phase position in

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the image can predict the shoulder

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,479
surfing risk more accurately

212
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
note that some of these feature sets

213
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
have very different computational

214
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
requirements for instance face detection

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
can be performed on many current

216
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
smartphones in real time however

217
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,360
estimating the user's gaze direction

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
requires more complex

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
models or neural networks that may not

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
run on current devices in real time

221
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
while our work is the first to assess

222
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
the shoulder surfing risk based on

223
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,199
visual features extracted from the

224
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
observer's face as captured by the front

225
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
facing camera in combination with the

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,560
content it also has several limitations

227
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,199
first our method is only as good as the

228
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
underlying face detection algorithm if

229
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,759
no phase can be detected

230
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
our method cannot be used to predict the

231
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,680
shoulder surfing risk

232
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
while most of the current generation

233
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,080
devices have limited field of view wide

234
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,200
angle cameras are much more promising as

235
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,159
they capture the user surrounding better

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
moreover there are already smartphones

237
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,559
that have a wide-angle front-facing

238
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
camera

239
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
second another limitation may be due to

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,839
the difficulty of acquiring a diverse

241
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
training set for our method for privacy

242
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
scout to generalize it needs a wide

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
range of observation and viewing angles

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
the results that we saw earlier used

245
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
images from our user study four

246
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
distances by three angles however in

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
real world some of these images cannot

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
be used as the user may occlude the

249
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,760
shoulder surfer

250
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
for instance when the shoulder surfer is

251
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,839
standing behind the user

252
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,880
as such

253
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
future work should investigate how many

254
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
images and from which angles and

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,959
distances are necessary to make our

256
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,599
approach more robust

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
a take-home message we introduced a

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
novel approach to analyze the impact of

259
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
distance and angle on the success of

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
shoulder surfing attacks our findings

261
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,959
show that while pins are vulnerable

262
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,440
independent of the locations distances

263
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
and angles played a role for photos and

264
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,720
text based on the earlier findings we

265
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
could request a shoulder surfing risk

266
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,199
score thank you for watching
