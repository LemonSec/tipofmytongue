1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,439
hello everyone next i will show you some

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,399
results about the construction of zika

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,320
snacks

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,480
now let's restart what's there knowledge

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
proofs basically you have two parties

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,280
one is the approval another is verified

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,279
the pro want to convince the verify that

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,800
some cement

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
through some numbers or wrong

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,560
interactions at the end of the

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,519
interactions not verify the

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
investor decides to accept or reject and

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
also the proverb doesn't want to reveal

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
its secret information here is an

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
example the prover ice and the rubber

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,040
ball you get some vietnamese taco

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
to prove some acts

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,160
through some

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
number one interactions

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
certainly we are introduced to those

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
protocols that have some

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
special practices was

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,480
first is the completeness

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,280
it means the proverb and the verified

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
falls are honest then the

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
guru can convince the very better if x

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
indeed is true secondly

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
if the approval is malicious then she

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,600
cannot convince the very better if x is

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
not true with a high probability

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
third is zero knowledge if the verifier

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
is a malicious then we cannot learn

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
anything more than our data of

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,119
syntax

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
here is some application from wiki

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
for example we can use the range proof

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
to

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
throw some

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,439
number in a given range without

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
revealing the exact value of number

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
other applications include the

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,119
membership proof

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
with auctions

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
and voting and so on

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
now last we look at what's r1cs relation

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,759
basically when this incident x is a

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
turbo which includes seven elements

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,920
clearer matrix abc three and time map

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
and matrix this is the public input

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,439
vector w is the private input

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
and we also assume each matrix

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
has at most unnatural injuries now the

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,520
r1cs relation

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,400
is to ask whether there

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,120
exists a witness such as this inclusion

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
horse

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
now giving our sense instance over the

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
field f we choose firstly

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
offense base

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,920
each with size f

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
m

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
then

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,160
the matrix a actually reduce

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,280
making some canonical out

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,319
mean any entry in the matrix

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,280
a can be accessed with two entry added

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
value

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
similarly any elements

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,760
of z can be accessed with an intriguing

70
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
h

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
now we define a function f double x

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
equal to this

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
f double x is used to increase the

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
vector z which includes

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
private and witness tablet

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,599
then the r1css

77
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,040
relation

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,000
can be converted to this satisfication

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,599
problem

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
this mean every x in the set h is

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
zero the function f w

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,480
if we use

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
polynomial interpolation

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
here the function of w

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,599
actually is also

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,760
polynomial it means every x in the set

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,360
each is the root of the polynomial f w

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,840
then we use

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,720
some

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
algebraic technique to convert this

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
polynomial specification problem

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,640
to this

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
using the

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
foundation

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
theory of arabic this equivalent to

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,280
that

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
there exists some pronoun g

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
which degree

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
s normal then

100
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,640
m minus 2 such that f double x equal to

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,360
v

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
h x times g x

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
then

104
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,000
this equation can be verified at the

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
random points

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
which is chosen by the verified

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
of course this associated with

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,520
some soundness

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
as a shortly problem

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
we can also

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,479
reduce

112
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,520
them

113
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,160
furthermore

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
this

115
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
lets fw

116
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,440
w equal to this

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
because the fw better definition of w is

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,919
equal to e times b minus c

119
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,440
then we

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
compute a rx erx crx then the prover

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
made three separate column

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
this and assuming this is three new

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,840
values were verified

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
then i'll verify that evaluates

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
the trx and zrx locally

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
we should in turn

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
enable the verified lead to verify this

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
equation

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,600
but here the program made the 3

130
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
new several columns so the verified we

131
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,160
must still verify these new claims

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
from the

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
plural

134
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
that we can do this in a very

135
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,720
[Music]

136
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
verify the sum of three challenges

137
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
and send them to the approval

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
then the proverb prove

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
this

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,800
combined claim

141
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
we can further

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
write this command

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
climb to this actually this combined

144
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,840
claims is some check then we're using

145
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,599
the universal checker protocol

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,639
remember that

147
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,680
the

148
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
universe some checker protocol

149
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,319
in each round

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,199
the

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
degrees

152
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
reduced by half

153
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
then

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,479
however we need some initial

155
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,600
conditions to step forward

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,280
universal check

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
clear the initial condition and

158
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,600
some

159
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
evaluation of the

160
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400

all the other atoms in the

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
armor expression determined by the

182

distance x and can be computed locally

183
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
by v

184
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
however this take

185
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
at least

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
in time still linear time

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
you cannot

188
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,000
because

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,680
in practical

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
the verified

191
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
euro has very limited commission power

192
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,960
cannot perform the linear time

193
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
capacity and how to different computer

194
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
mr x y for

195
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,520
each matrix

196
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
this is our

197
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
main contribution in this paper

198
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
we define this favorite

199
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
polynomial

200
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,160
delta h x y equal to z h x minus v h y

201
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
divis x

202
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,759
plus y

203
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,039
the individual degree is the size of

204
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,919
each maximum because if x is equal to y

205
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
certainly the h x is equal to this one

206
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
so

207
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,799
the

208
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,279
x minus y is a factor of the numbers

209
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,800
now we choose h as a offense based on

210
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
the

211
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
phenomenon the hx has

212
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
a very special form

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,839
so called the

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
linearized phenomena

215
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
now we write the

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
expression of delta x

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
y if in the case x not equal to y

218
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
the data x

219
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,120
y can be written as this form

220
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
if x is equal to y

221
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
we cannot do

222
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,800
it like that

223
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,230
because

224
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,360
[Music]

225
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
x is equal to yx

226
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,040
0 we cannot divide by zero so we can

227
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,600
consider this as a discrete derivative

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
then

229
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,360
divided at

230
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
x

231
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
actually this is equal to c one

232
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,560
a

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,959
non-zero constant

234
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
then let's

235
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,680
roll

236
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
column and value

237
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
represents the row index column index

238
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,360
and value of the non-zero interest

239
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
matrix and

240
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
some canonical function

241
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
because that

242
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
the computation

243
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,399
mr xy

244
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,279
the

245
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,080
zero interest

246
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
don't make any contributions to these

247
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
compositions so we need some method to

248
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
fill out the

249
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
filter out the non-zero interest we're

250
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
using the data h

251
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
function delta h define the

252
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
periods

253
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
then this m rx equal to this the first

254
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
item can be computed by the verifying

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,959
very efficiently

256
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
and the second version only contains the

257
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
zero interest or

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,560
at only

259
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,199
linear time

260
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,839
then we using gcr to

261
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
compute this query

262
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,560
because the dkr photographer is doubly

263
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
impatient

264
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
and also our

265
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
competition is very

266
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,079
and has many

267
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,200
some repeated some structure so we can

268
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
use in the dkr protocol to

269
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,040
compute this very very differently

270
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,279
here the proton and linear version is

271
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,480
pulling

272
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
with log in square

273
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,880
the table below is the

274
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,399
overall

275
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
complexity and the comparison with some

276
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
other

277
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
schemes

278
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
we also

279
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
have some concrete benchmarks here is

280
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,399
the proof wrong time

281
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,360
there is argument assigned and

282
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
[Music]

283
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
verified at running time

284
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,880
our schema is not

285
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
one that

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
win in every

287
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,920
perspective

288
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
but it can private

289
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,040
provide the creator of some

290
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,319
practical applications

291
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
well

292
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,120
that's

293
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
all

294
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,399
works

295
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,279
okay

296
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,519
thank you for your attention now any

297
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,519
questions
