hi

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,439
this work gives tighter approximations

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,319
of privacy loss distributions useful for

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,080
privacy accounting of differentially

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,719
private mechanisms i am pritish and this

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,599
is joint work with wadeem batiya ravi

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
and passin

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,520
differential privacy has become the de

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,000
facto standard definition of privacy a

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
mechanism satisfies epsilon delta dp if

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
for all neighboring data sets x and x

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,320
prime namely those which differ on only

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
one input it should hold that the

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,600
probability of any event on input x is

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
at most e to the epsilon times the

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
probability of the same event on input x

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,440
prime up to an additive delta

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,760
a motivating example to keep in mind is

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
the dpsgd algorithm which is a

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,920
stochastic gradient descent algorithm

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
where we add gaussian noise to mini

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,840
batch gradient averages at each step

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
dpsgd has been quite popular for

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,600
differentially private training of

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,399
neural networks for example

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
for any mechanism m and an epsilon value

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
the goal of privacy accounting is to

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
compute a delta such that m satisfies

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
epsilon delta dp

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
accounting methods are essential for

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
computing parameters underlying the

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
mechanism such as the noise scale in

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,200
dpsgd

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,119
here i would like to give a shout out to

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,119
the google dp library which we are

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
actively developing

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
it contains privacy accounting tools

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,080
among other algorithms

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
now there is a two-fold goal when

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,720
designing an accounting method namely we

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,360
want the computed delta value to be as

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
tight as possible and we want the

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
computation to be as fast as possible

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,000
privacy loss distributions or pld for

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
short provide a tight numerical approach

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
to privacy accounting

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
at a high level this approach works by

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
associating a worst case or a dominating

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
pair of probability distributions p and

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,520
q

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
to a given mechanism

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,439
such that the e to the epsilon hockey

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,240
stick divergence between p and q

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,639
gives an upper bound on the delta value

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,560
of the mechanism for any given epsilon

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
this can also be naturally expressed in

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
terms of the corresponding pld

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
we will abuse notation to call this the

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,840
hocistic divergence of the pld itself

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
the key property of plds that make them

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
useful is that compositions of

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,280
mechanisms simply corresponds to

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,440
addition of the corresponding pld random

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
variables or equivalently the

65
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
convolution of the privacy loss

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,959
distributions

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,160
for example the pld corresponding to the

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,920
gaussian mechanism is a gaussian

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
distribution

70
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
and so the pld corresponding to self

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
compositions of the gaussian mechanism

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,239
is also a gaussian distribution with a

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,840
larger mean and variance

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
thus the goal of privacy accounting of

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
composed mechanisms is reduced to the

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
task of performing convolutions of

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,440
privacy loss distributions

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
in order to make this practical it is

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
common to work with a discretized

80
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
version of the privacy loss distribution

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
and furthermore it is possible to

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
perform the convolution operation in

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,400
time that is nearly linear in the number

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
of buckets

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
using fast fourier transform

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
in our work we revisit the procedure of

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,599
truncation and discretization introduced

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,959
in prior work

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
and our main contribution is a new

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
discretization procedure that provides

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
tighter approximations to the privacy

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
loss distribution for the purposes of

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,640
estimating the hockey stick divergence

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
in order to describe our contribution

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
let's first revisit how discretization

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,239
is done in literature currently

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
we start with a set of epsilon values

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
that we want the discretized pld to be

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
supported on

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
we take epsilon 0 to be minus infinity

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,080
and the largest epsilon value namely

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
epsilon k to be plus infinity

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,239
to get a discretized pld one simply

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
rounds up the probability mass in each

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
bucket

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
this ensures that we get an upper bound

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,478
or what we call a pessimistic estimate

108
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
of the hockey stick divergence even

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
after convolution with any other pld

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
this approach can also be used to get a

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,800
lower bound or what we call an

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
optimistic estimate of the hockey stick

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
divergence by simply rounding down the

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
probability masses

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
one technical point to note here is that

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
this optimistic discretization might not

117
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,320
be a pld corresponding to any pair of

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
distributions but it suffices to give us

119
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
optimistic estimates of the hockey stick

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
divergence

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
there is a lot more prior work on this

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
topic which differ in the details of the

123
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,400
discretization procedures but one thing

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
common among all these approaches is

125
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
that they all work by discretizing the

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,919
privacy loss distribution directly

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
we use a fundamentally different

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
approach in our work

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,039
in particular instead of directly

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,400
working with the privacy loss

131
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
distribution we work with the

132
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,360
reparameterization of it which let us

133
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
call as the hockey stick curve

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
our main technique then is to discretize

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
the hockey stick curve using the

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
approach we call as connect the dots

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
this approach works in such a way that

138
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,720
when converted back into a pld it is

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
discrete and precisely supported on the

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,400
desired set of epsilon values

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
this approach can be done in both a

142
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,160
pessimistic and an optimistic manner

143
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
i will describe our approach in this

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,639
talk

145
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
starting with how to translate back and

146
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
forth between privacy loss distributions

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,039
and hockey stick curves

148
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
for any given pld its corresponding

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,039
hockey stick curve is a function h such

150
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
that h of e to the epsilon is the e to

151
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
the epsilon hockey stick divergence of

152
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
the pld

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
this is simply a reparameterization of

154
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,639
the delta for epsilon function

155
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
in the recent work zoo at all showed

156
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,759
that a hockey stick curve corresponds to

157
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
some pld

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,520
if and only if it satisfies certain

159
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
properties namely that it is convex

160
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,919
non-increasing h of 0 is 1 and h of

161
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,440
alpha is at least 1 minus alpha

162
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
we build on this result and show that a

163
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
hockey stick curve corresponds to a

164
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
discrete pld supported on a given set of

165
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,440
epsilon values if and only if the same

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
properties hold in addition to two more

167
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,160
properties namely that the curve is

168
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
linear

169
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
is piecewise linear with the anchors

170
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,560
being the e to the epsilon values and

171
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
moreover the curve is a constant for all

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
values greater than the last finite e to

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,199
the epsilon value which is e to the

174
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,080
epsilon k minus 1.

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
when these properties hold we show how

176
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,800
to reconstruct the corresponding

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
discrete pld efficiently and in a

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
numerically stable manner

179
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
this completes the translation between

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
privacy loss distributions and hokiestic

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,240
curves

182
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
finally i will describe the approach of

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
connect the dots to discretize a hockey

184
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
stick curve

185
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,800
in order to do that it is important to

186
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
note a key theorem shown by ju at all

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
that if we have two hockey stick curves

188
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
h1 and h2 such that h1 is always less

189
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,919
than or equal to h2 then the pld

190
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
corresponding to h2

191
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,639
gives rise to a pessimistic estimate

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,360
of

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
the hockey stick divergence over the pld

194
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,039
corresponding to h1

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,000
thus

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,280
given any

197
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,000
hockey stick curve and a specified set

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
of epsilon values we have a natural

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,599
approach

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,560
we simply connect the dots to get a

201
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
piecewise linear hockey stick curve that

202
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
is precisely anchored on the desired e

203
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
to the epsilon values thus corresponding

204
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,560
to a pessimistic pld that is discrete

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
and supported on precisely the specified

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
set of epsilons

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
in fact this construction is the

208
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
tightest possible pessimistic pld that

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,360
one could get that is supported on the

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
given epsilon

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,400
for example this can be seen by

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,080
comparing to the hockey stick curve

213
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
attained by the prior approach i

214
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,559
described earlier of rounding up

215
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,679
probability masses

216
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
we also provide an algorithm to get an

217
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
optimistic pld that is based on a greedy

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,720
algorithm to choose a candidate set of

219
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,360
points that the curve would be anchored

220
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,160
on and then using a convex algorithm to

221
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
find a subset of the anchors that form

222
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
the optimistic hockey sticker

223
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,279
it turns out that unlike the pessimistic

224
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
acoustic curve there is in fact no

225
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
unique best optimistic choice our

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,160
algorithm is just one of the choices

227
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
that we found to be giving good

228
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
optimistic estimates empirically

229
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
our algorithm shows a significant

230
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,839
improvement over the implementations

231
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,279
available in the

232
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,920
current google's differential privacy

233
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
differential privacy library and

234
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
microsoft's prv are counted

235
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
these plots show a comparison between

236
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,680
our new algorithm and these

237
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
implementations using the same set of

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,959
epsilons given to each algorithm

239
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,200
our algorithm thus gets a significantly

240
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
tighter estimate of the privacy

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
parameters for roughly the same

242
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,839
computational running time

243
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
for more details please see our paper

244
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,279
to summarize our new approach of

245
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,839
connecting the dots can provide tighter

246
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,920
discrete approximations of privacy loss

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
distributions which provides superior

248
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,360
approximations compared to prior work at

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
the same level of discretization

250
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
some potential future directions on this

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,480
work include theoretically understanding

252
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
the error guarantees of our approach as

253
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
well as investigating other approaches

254
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
to optimize to obtaining optimistic

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
discrete pld for more details please see
