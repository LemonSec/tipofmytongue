1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,560
hi my name is sarah piermann i am going

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,080
to talk to you today about our paper

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,640
entitled user-friendly yet rarely read a

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,559
case study on the redesign of an online

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,360
hipaa authorization and i would like to

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,440
thank my co-authors ellie young and lori

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
crainer for all of their help with this

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,199
project

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
so a major u.s health insurance company

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,439
that for this talk we're just going to

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,840
call healthco is building a chatbot for

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
customers to ask questions about their

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
health insurance coverage that chatbot

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
uses google cloud apis for storage and

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
natural language processing so because

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,440
of hipaa

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
long story short sending any of that

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
data to google cloud requires special

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
consent from the user or the patient

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,840
so let me set the stage of when someone

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
might use this our imaginary user named

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,559
danny let's say she

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,039
hurts her ankle hiking maybe she needs

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,480
an x-ray and she's worried about how

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
much it's going to cost

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
so she goes to the healthco website

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
while she's there she sees the chatbot

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,079
icon and she figures she can ask the

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,320
chatbot about her coverage

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,559
the chatbot then presents her with a

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
hipaa authorization document that she

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
has to read and agree to before she can

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
ask that question

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,680
so

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
reading these documents as we already

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
know is hard and it's time consuming

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,479
but users are told to make these choices

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,560
about health data carefully

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,159
but we know that regularly reading

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
documents like this could add up to

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,439
hundreds of hours per year which is

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,920
already not a reasonable burden

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,840
for the average user

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
and then the healthcare context adds

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,759
extra pressure you're even less likely

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
presumably to want to read something

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
like this when you are in pain and

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,360
trying to seek health care in a timely

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
fashion

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,680
so we knew that this consent flow could

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
pose some challenges and so we conducted

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
a three-phase study to evaluate it and

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,399
also iterate on the designs

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,320
um so i will talk to you about our

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,479
qualitative remote user study sessions

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,520
first

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
so in the first phase of this study we

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
used user session insights to iterate on

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,759
and improve the original design of the

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
consent flow for this chatbot

61
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
we were mostly focused on usability and

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
comprehension of certain important

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,200
pieces of information here and we also

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,920
incorporated known best practices

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
um for uh notice and choice as we

66
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,879
redesigned the

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,280
consent flow prototype

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,760
so in our user study sessions users were

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
given a scenario like that ankle injury

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
example that i gave you

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
and um we asked them to show us what

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
they would do if they wanted to ask the

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,599
chat about a question and they used an

74
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,920
interactive adobe xd prototype to do

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
that

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
we also then asked follow-up questions

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
about usability impressions as well as

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
understandings of and feelings about

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,080
what they agreed to

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
and we did three rounds of that with six

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
participants each iterating on the

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
prototype each time based on what we

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
observed

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
so let me just set the stage here a

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
little bit about what this

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,959
consent flow looked like so before they

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
actually got to the hipaa authorization

88
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,800
process if it was the part we were

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
really iterating on there were two steps

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,800
that were basically the same across all

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
versions so first

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
they are on the website as though

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
they're a patient logged in

94
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,959
they click the chat bot icon in the

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
lower right corner

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
and then a little prompt pops up it says

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
hi i'm sam and they can click let's chat

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
if they want to use the chatbot

99
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
so next i'll talk to you about the

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
actual hipaa authorization part that

101
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
happened before they could use the

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
chatbot and the different versions of

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
that that we

104
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
were evaluating here so the initial

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,280
version had three screens

106
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
at least in the required flow there were

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
some optional detours that users could

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,440
take in this one

109
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
so on the first screen users would see

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,599
this prompt from the chatbot about

111
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
agreeing to a hipaa authorization and

112
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
then they saw two buttons one said view

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
resources and that took them to

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
essentially a human readable summary of

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
this legal document

116
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
that button was optional and then the

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
other button view digital hipaa

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,080
authorization was required and took them

119
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
to the actual legal document that they

120
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,879
were required to view

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
so right away here we have a confusing

122
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,959
choice people did not know which of

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
these buttons was required they did not

124
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,880
know what view resources meant and so

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
that was a challenge for users

126
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
if they did click that view digital

127
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
hipaa authorization button they would

128
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
then see this screen the second screen

129
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
in the initial version of the prototype

130
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,759
and this was um

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,960
the actual legal authorization it opened

132
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,759
as a pdf in a separate tab

133
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,199
so there were some problems with the

134
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
document itself it was long it was

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
confusing but it also left out some

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
important information

137
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
and we found that users were just not

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
grasping that the data wasn't subject to

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
hipaa or that google cloud was receiving

140
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
it

141
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,639
the next screen that users would see

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
was this prompt from the chatbot

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
essentially to click i agree to that pdf

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
that they had just seen

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
and the main problem here was just that

146
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
users didn't always understand how to

147
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,479
return to this tab

148
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,680
this screen with the pdf was confusing

149
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
for especially less tech savvy users

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
that were not really familiar with

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
browser tabs and they struggled to find

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
that tab in the top left corner to get

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
back to the chatbot tab

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,320
um so in version two we tried to

155
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
simplify a lot of things here to help

156
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,120
users get through this flow

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
so we put everything in a modal window

158
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
um the first screen of the second

159
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
version here shows that human readable

160
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
summary that was previously behind that

161
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
view resources button they see this in

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
this modal window they scroll to the

163
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,800
bottom and they click i agree

164
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,080
we thought that would help but we

165
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
actually found that users were so just

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,320
confused by the presence of this extra

167
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,919
document they didn't understand the

168
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,000
difference between this and the actual

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
hipaa authorization so that was a

170
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
challenge

171
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
and here's the second screen of version

172
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
two so this is that legal document it's

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
in that modal window instead of in a pdf

174
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
in a separate tab they scroll to the

175
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
bottom they click i agree

176
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,400
and so in this actual document we made

177
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
some readability improvements between

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
versions one and two we made some

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
content updates to add some things that

180
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,199
the

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
us department of health and human

182
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
services recommends in their model

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
privacy notice but many users were still

184
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,039
not understanding that the data wasn't

185
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
subject to hipaa or that google cloud

186
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,240
was getting it

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
so we tried again with a third version

188
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,160
this version was really simple there was

189
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
one screen in the hipaa authorization

190
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,440
portion

191
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
they just

192
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
saw the required legal document in the

193
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
modal window they scrolled to the bottom

194
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
and they clicked i agree

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,160
so we had removed the additional step of

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
viewing that summary document we

197
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
did keep the pieces of that that seemed

198
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,680
to be useful some of the more simplified

199
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
language to try to help people

200
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
understand we just rolled that into the

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
legal document

202
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
and we also added some summary sentences

203
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
at the top highlighting that the data

204
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,800
was not subject to hipaa and that it was

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,039
going to google cloud

206
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,080
so

207
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
this version looked really good in these

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
sessions in terms of usability users

209
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,720
didn't need hints to get through it

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
but their comprehension was still not

211
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
where we wanted it to be

212
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
so part of that was just

213
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,479
as you would expect most people don't

214
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
read these things they say it's just

215
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
standard it's boilerplate the company's

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
just trying to protect themselves from

217
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,599
being sued for something

218
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,319
and

219
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,560
interestingly we also found that the

220
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
word hipaa alone seemed to be giving

221
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
people a false sense of security

222
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
so that was really concerning many

223
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
people just saw that word hipaa they

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
thought hipaa equals privacy and so they

225
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,479
concluded um essentially the opposite of

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,840
what was true thinking that this

227
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
document because it says hipaa it's

228
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
telling me that data can't be shared

229
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
with third parties

230
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
so next we conducted a crowdsource

231
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
survey to try to get some quantitative

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
data about what was going on here

233
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,199
in the second phase we surveyed over 700

234
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
participants on prolific to compare

235
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,919
three versions of the consent flow those

236
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,919
three that you just saw

237
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,319
so users were given a

238
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
task essentially that ankle injury

239
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,639
scenario they were asked to try to ask

240
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
the chatbot a question and they saw one

241
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
of the three prototypes in a randomized

242
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
fashion

243
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
we then asked them some follow-up

244
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
usability and understanding and attitude

245
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,479
questions

246
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
and then what we did in the survey here

247
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,240
was um after asking those questions that

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
intentionally

249
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
eventually did prime people to think

250
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
about privacy

251
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
once they were primed we asked them to

252
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,560
go back and review the text carefully

253
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
and then we

254
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
asked them the same questions again and

255
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
they could change their answers if they

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
had learned something new when they

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
reviewed the text more carefully

258
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
so our final version from the user

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
sessions tested better in terms of

260
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
usability although all of the versions

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,080
did okay in that regard

262
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
but games and understanding were more

263
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,440
limited

264
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,080
especially until people did that second

265
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
read-through of the document

266
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,959
so across various comprehension metrics

267
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
understanding was poor before text

268
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
review

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,120
and significantly improved after

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
um so people really were just not

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
understanding things like that google

272
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
cloud would receive data until they read

273
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
the text again

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
um

275
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
and so that was important there wasn't

276
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
really a significant difference in

277
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
people's willingness to use the chat bot

278
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
between versions of the prototype but

279
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
what we did see was that there was a

280
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
significant decrease in willingness to

281
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
use the chatbot after people were asked

282
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
to reread the document so they were

283
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,800
learning something new like they were

284
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
learning that google cloud was getting

285
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
their data which they had not noticed

286
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
before and they were not happy about it

287
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
and they no longer wanted to use the

288
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
thing they had previously agreed to use

289
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
and that is meaningful

290
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,959
so

291
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,800
um i won't be able to get into the um

292
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
additional crowd source survey that we

293
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
conducted in phase three in great detail

294
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,079
essentially we were looking a little

295
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,680
more closely there

296
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
at the effect of the word hipaa on

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
people's understanding

298
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,839
we mostly had no results in this part

299
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
um they are still interesting and i

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
invite you to read about them in the

301
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
paper but there's just one part in the

302
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,519
time we have that i want to share and

303
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,920
that is that um we found in that survey

304
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
that most people were vastly

305
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
overestimating the power of hipaa to

306
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
prevent disclosure

307
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
so for those not in the u.s are not

308
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,959
familiar with hipaa

309
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,920
hipaa

310
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,440
does

311
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
set rules about the sharing of health

312
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
care information but hipaa doesn't apply

313
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
to everyone or every entity it applies

314
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
to health care providers health

315
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
insurance companies and other adjacent

316
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
entities that interact with health care

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
so over 60 percent of people believe

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
that hipaa prevented anyone or any

319
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
company from sharing health care

320
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,800
information not true over 60 percent

321
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
believe that hipaa says no person or

322
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
company can share protected health

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
information without the patient's

324
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
permission also not true and only about

325
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
a quarter of people knew the right

326
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
answers to these questions

327
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
so takeaways obtaining truly informed

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
consent is always difficult but even

329
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,720
more so in the context of hipaa

330
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
best practices for notice and choice

331
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,959
were able to help improve usability and

332
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,600
comprehension on reread the people were

333
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
still missing a lot of important points

334
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
when they were in the context of a

335
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
primary task like they would be in the

336
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
real world and if people are not

337
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
noticing information that would cause

338
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,959
them to be unwilling to use the tool

339
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,279
that's a major problem for informed
