1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,040
sleeping

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,840
welcome to hot pets 2022

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,319
i don't have too too much to say

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,639
just a little bit about the program this

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,480
year so

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
my co-chair rebecca and i put a lot of

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,960
emphasis into trying to bring hot pets

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
back to its roots as a sort of

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
interactive workshop as opposed to a

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
continuation of the technical program of

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,439
pets

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,880
so we put a lot of

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
focus on accepting things not because

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,720
they were technically awesome a lot of

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,240
our submissions were but because we

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
thought that they had a high potential

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,640
to

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
produce thought-provoking discussions

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,480
amongst the group

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,079
so

21
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
keep that in mind the uh we're going to

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
start with an invited talk and we also

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,079
have a keynote talk at the end and then

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
in the middle there's a researcher

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,640
there's contributed talks the

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,800
contributed talks are very much

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,879
um

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,199
going to be of the form they have a half

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
hour we've asked them to talk for like

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,559
10 to 15 minutes of that half an hour

31
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
say some things to frame a conversation

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
so you are very very very much

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,879
encouraged to think of things that you

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,720
would like to say during that question

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
and answer period because it's on all of

36
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,479
you in the audience to keep the

37
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,080
discussion going it was wildly

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,600
successful this morning hopefully this

39
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
afternoon is just as good

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,840
um

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
so we are now on the second half of this

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,640
program we are going to open with a

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,560
invited talk by vanessa teague who is

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,680
our

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
australian on the program we were very

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
happy to have a speaker who actually

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
came to sydney and is going to give the

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
talk live um followed by that i believe

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
the next speaker is also in person is

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
the next speaker in the room yes okay so

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,240
we have another two in a row in person

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
which is great uh followed by a short

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,439
break and then two that are

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,000
unfortunately not in person but uh

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,159
promised to be awesome talks and then

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
another short break and then our keynote

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
by tanya lokat which is also not in

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,360
person but also promises to be

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
a very very interesting presentation

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
so

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
um yes and this part is completely

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
irrelevant now because it's over but

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,399
that was my last slide so

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,639
with uh with that being said i will

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,120
welcome vanessa to come and take the

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
floor

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,170
yes

68
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,239

okay

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,720
i'm taking to heart this instruction

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
about it being interactive and uh you

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
know back and forth

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
and i've even got my little computer set

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,080
up here so i think i should be able to

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
see chat questions from the gather as

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
well so please if you're either in the

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
physical audience or

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
in the

80
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,599
virtual

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,640
world

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,440
uh chat to me and ask me questions or

84
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
okay my name is vanessa teague and

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,720
this project that i'm about to talk

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,080
about has had great contributions from

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
lots of people listed on the slide that

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
you can see the particular technical

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
details in this particular talk are

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,159
joint work with chris cullman

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,480
the project is called right to ask it's

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
an australian project about encouraging

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
australians to get interested in

94
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
involved actively involved in

95
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
parliamentary democracy and since this

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,920
is pets i'm going to talk primarily

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
about the privacy aspects of the project

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,879
although there are heaps of other

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,560
aspects of the project as well

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
so here's a little summary of where

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,560
we're going first of all i'm going to

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
give an overview of what the project's

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,720
about

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
then i'm going to talk about the

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
cryptographic tools which i imagine are

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,799
very familiar to some fraction of the

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,400
audience we're going to talk a little

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
bit about the bulletin board then i'm

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,280
finally going to get to talking about

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,519
the privacy model and then hopefully we

111
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
can have some time for discussion at the

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
end although discussion is encouraged as

113
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,599
we go as well

114
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
so here's what it's meant to be about

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
the idea is

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,239
to allow people to ask and focus

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,319
political questions and to be able to

118
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
upvote or downvote other people's

119
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
political questions so that the most

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
popular or most relevant questions

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
bubble up to the top

122
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
so i've we've made up some examples for

123
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,120
the purpose of this slide

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,839
and you can see that

125
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,320
this kind of there's a few different

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
rules for the

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,800
app

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
one is just letting people write out a

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
question

130
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
two is helping people to direct the

131
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,240
question to the right parliamentarian or

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,759
the right parliamentary committee or the

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,520
most effective place that it can be

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,479
asked

135
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,240
and the third thing is kind of upvoting

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,759
other people's questions or down voting

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,199
other people's questions so that the

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
most popular questions can be

139
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
immediately evident to the

140
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
parliamentarians who are supposed to be

141
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,479
receiving and either answering or

142
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,160
raising the question so there's kind of

143
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
two things that an mp is supposed to be

144
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,120
able to do with the question one is

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,479
they're supposed to be able to answer it

146
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,240
directly and the other is they're

147
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
supposed to be able to take it into a

148
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
committee hearing or into question time

149
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,960
or something and direct the question to

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
somebody else

151
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
so two completely different things

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,919
actually maybe it's for the mp to answer

153
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,880
or maybe it's for the mp to raise

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,639
and get somebody else to answer

155
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
so

156
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
i've been working in

157
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
voting for many years now and

158
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
there are things that we think we know

159
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,639
how to do

160
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,280
in uh election electronic election

161
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,759
verification

162
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,800
so

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,440
microsoft has recently released a crypto

164
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,240
library which doesn't really plan to

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
it's not really intended to and to do

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
anything radically innovative it's

167
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
really just intended to implement

168
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
a series of tools that have been known

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,960
in the community for a long time

170
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,360
it's called election guard and it has a

171
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
couple of things that i'm going to

172
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
describe in a minute it has a very nice

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,759
simple old-fashioned additive

174
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,919
homomorphic encryption which you can see

175
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,360
is obviously going to be useful if some

176
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
people are voting plus one and some

177
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,680
people are voting zero we can add them

178
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
all together we can add everybody's

179
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
votes together

180
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,080
and uh decrypt the aggregated total

181
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
without ever decrypting any individual

182
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
votes

183
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,479
it has threshold key generation and

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,720
distributed decryption in a clever way

185
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
so that the key is never recombined

186
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,400
and it has a variety of zero-knowledge

187
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,639
proofs that allow the administrator of

188
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
the election to prove that all of this

189
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
computation all of this computational

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
encrypted data is being done correct

191
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
so the idea

192
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
which i thought at the beginning of this

193
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
project is this is all super simple

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,000
right we're just we can just use this

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
library and all these tools that have

196
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,400
been known in the voting community

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
forever and uh everything's just going

198
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
to work straight off the bat we can add

199
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
up our upvotes and down votes decrypt

200
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,240
the collective aggregate and

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
prove that it was all done correctly and

202
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,400
everything's going to work

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,400
here's kind of the traditional picture

204
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,599
of what

205
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
a uh

206
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
ordinary homophobic encryption based

207
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,919
voting protocol would look like in the

208
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
cryptographic literature so this for

209
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
example is approximately what helios

210
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
looks like if you voted in iacr

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
elections it's also a fair approximation

212
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
to what the estonian internet voting

213
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
protocol looks like a bunch of other

214
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
voting protocols from a long way back

215
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
look like this

216
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,599
so

217
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
on the far left hand side

218
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
imagine a person voting

219
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,280
on their own device

220
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
which they don't necessarily trust

221
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
they're asking their device to encrypt

222
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,440
a number let's say a one or a zero you

223
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,039
know a support or not support a

224
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,520
particular candidate

225
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
uh and they're making in this instance

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,359
we're just using uh alcohol encryption

227
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
most

228
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,080
real voting protocols that try to defend

229
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
against an untrusted client

230
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,039
give the voter some opportunity to try

231
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,280
to challenge their client

232
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,599
and some kind of opportunity to get some

233
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,039
kind of a proof

234
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,639
usually by

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
querying via another device

236
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
some kind of a proof that the ciphertext

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,759
that they asked for

238
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,000
sorry that the plain text they asked

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
asked for is properly encoded in the

240
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
ciphertext that was made

241
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
so

242
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,639
everything in the left-hand column is

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
very hard and the hardness of this stuff

244
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,159
in the left-hand column is really a

245
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
reason that i don't think we should be

246
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
running protocols like this for

247
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
government elections

248
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
hard enough for cryptographers in the

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,519
iscr to do it

250
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
but but anyway the protocols exist

251
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
whether the protocols exist in a way

252
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
that actual humans can actually use is a

253
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,359
different question

254
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
and then everything kind of from

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
to the right of the leftmost column is

256
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,480
stuff that we actually know how to do

257
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
really quite well

258
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,160
we know how to put votes on a public

259
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,839
bulletin board we know how to aggregate

260
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,080
encrypted values

261
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
we know how to

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
uh prove that they've been properly

263
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
decrypted without ever

264
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
recombining the key

265
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
and then we know how to produce a sum

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
that everybody can have confidence in so

267
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
i don't necessarily believe anything in

268
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
the leftmost column and i don't

269
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
necessarily believe that we have a good

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,519
way for voters to make sure that they've

271
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
made the vote they want to make from an

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
untrusted device

273
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
but if you're kind of willing to let

274
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
that bit slide we kind of know how to do

275
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
everything

276
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
from the blue line

277
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
onwards

278
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,959
so

279
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
for my project

280
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
i'm just going to give up on the

281
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
challenging your own vote side of the

282
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
diagram and we're just going to trust

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
the app

284
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,920
to record the upvote or downvote that

285
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
the person wants

286
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,640
whether you think that's a reasonable

287
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,079
choice or not i'd be kind of mildly

288
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
interested to hear um but at least at

289
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
the moment even though the election

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
garden library has the facility for

291
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,279
allowing people to challenge their

292
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
ciphertexts we're not going to bother

293
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
with that for this project

294
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,160
uh

295
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
we also don't have

296
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,399
serious voter authentication because you

297
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,519
know australia doesn't really have that

298
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,399
anyway

299
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,279
um we don't have and indeed helios

300
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,560
doesn't have

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,519
um

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,519
receipt freeness or defense against

303
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,519
coercion if you're making the ciphertext

304
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,959
on your device

305
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
then someone can come along later and

306
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,160
say

307
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,839
you know i can see your ciphertext on

308
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
the bulletin board show me what

309
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,839
randomness you used and prove to me what

310
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,800
vote you cast and uh again although

311
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
there are some attempts to solve this

312
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,079
problem i think this is a very hard

313
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,120
problem to solve and we're not even

314
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
going to try

315
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
so these are the things we're not even

316
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
going to try to do properly

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
so

318
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,760
i'm just going to quickly

319
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
overview

320
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,360
how the vote aggregation works

321
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
and if i

322
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
write this out on the slide

323
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
i'm guessing that for about half the

324
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,640
audience everybody's seen it before and

325
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,760
for the other half the audience is

326
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
totally incomprehensible so put up your

327
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,240
hand if you've seen this

328
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
ten thousand times before and it's

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
really obvious

330
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
put up your hand if you've never seen it

331
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
before and you'd like a two-minute

332
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
explanation okay so just there's a for a

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
couple of people

334
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
this is an encryption mechanism that is

335
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,680
very well studied and very old the idea

336
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
is that the ciphertext is encoded in the

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,440
exponent so here

338
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,720
just one laser point of work there

339
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
this is my this is my vote my v one

340
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
which is either zero or one

341
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,600
um

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,279
[Music]

343
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
every one of them is encrypted

344
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,680
there's a public operation for combining

345
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,639
them all together which is just

346
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,120
multiplication and we just have good

347
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,519
old-fashioned log laws for ending up

348
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,120
with

349
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
uh the sum of the votes in the place

350
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
where the encrypted message is so

351
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
anybody can take a collection of

352
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,560
ciphertexts

353
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
and aggregate them all together in the

354
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
encrypted domain and produce a

355
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,839
ciphertext of the sum of all of the

356
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,920
individual votes and this is cool

357
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,000
and then we have a way of decrypting

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,360
them in such a way that we can prove

359
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
that we decrypt it properly

360
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
so this is what it uses

361
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
uh we also have a bulletin board which

362
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
again is part of our repo and again is a

363
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
thing that has been in the literature

364
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
for a long time not not claiming that

365
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
it's brilliant or particularly original

366
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
but it exists uh it's based on a

367
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
merkle tree implementation in rust by

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
andrew conway and it's available

369
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
at the uh

370
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
on github where you can see

371
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
it's really just a very simple

372
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
merkle tree base efficient meckletree

373
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
based public ledger in which the crucial

374
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
thing is you can prove that

375
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,519
a certain data is present and you can

376
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
keep a record to show that it hasn't

377
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,320
been subsequently deleted

378
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
so that's all good this is what the

379
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,880
proofs look like they really exist

380
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,040
so now let's talk about the privacy

381
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,200
model for this setting because in a

382
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,639
traditional election setting or even a

383
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
professional society like election

384
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
setting like the iicr

385
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
we have one-shot elections

386
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,079
and we know that there's a certain

387
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,160
there's one election it runs for a

388
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,079
particular period of time

389
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,600
there's a certain population of people

390
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,880
who are allowed to vote and then we

391
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
aggregate it at the end

392
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
but right to ask is going to have a

393
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,959
completely different privacy model

394
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
because we're going to be continually

395
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,519
voting on some subset of questions that

396
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
come past

397
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
and we don't have a finite end

398
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,279
and we don't have one aggregation at the

399
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,920
end we have um

400
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
aggregation in batches as we go

401
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
so the privacy model is meant to be what

402
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
it says on this slide when you write the

403
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
question it becomes public and it has

404
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
your name on it

405
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,240
but your individual upvote or down vote

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,399
is meant to be private

407
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
and we have this decryption from the

408
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
election guard library where the

409
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
decryption key is two out of three

410
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,959
secret shares so there's not supposed to

411
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,360
be anybody who has the capacity to use

412
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
their key to decrypt your individual

413
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
vote

414
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,399
but let's now think about what the

415
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,920
appropriate privacy model in that

416
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
setting is so i agreed to give this talk

417
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,600
um

418
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,760
i wrote my abstract thinking oh i'm not

419
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
exactly sure how to do this right but

420
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,199
i'm sure i will figure it out in a week

421
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,160
or two by the time i actually have to

422
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
give a talk um i have to tell you the

423
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
more i thought about it the harder it

424
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
seemed and so in some ways this talk is

425
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
a short summary of things that don't

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
quite work and i'm not quite sure how to

427
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
do okay so here's the first

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
here's the first idea i'm just

429
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
remembering in um

430
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,360
so for the moment ignore the fact that

431
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
we have

432
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,040
three authorities who can together

433
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,839
um in a two out of three kind of setting

434
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
decrypt individual votes if they choose

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
to cheat there's actually another paper

436
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,720
which is joint work with uh

437
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
orpheus litos and aguiles aguelos

438
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,519
which talks about

439
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,600
sharing around that responsibility and

440
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,560
getting different members of the

441
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,639
community to act in that role but leave

442
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,079
that aside for a minute and just think

443
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,720
about this idealized kind of picture of

444
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,639
a list a public list of cipher texts

445
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,079
and an aggregate that gets decreed

446
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,120
so

447
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
this is actually different from ordinary

448
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,399
elections

449
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
there are some things that count in our

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,920
favor the greatest of which which is the

451
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,360
main reason i'm doing the project at all

452
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
is that really it's a lot less important

453
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,079
than real elections and the implications

454
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,240
of privacy breach are just a lot less

455
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
serious so maybe you just don't care

456
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,959
that much that's the first thing

457
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
the second thing is that unlike real

458
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
elections a little bit of perturbation

459
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,079
might be acceptable so we're not in this

460
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,199
context trying to figure out whether

461
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,720
50.01 percent of people voted one way

462
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,000
and 49.9 of people voted the other way

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,759
we're just trying to figure out what the

464
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
top 10 list of most popular questions on

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
any given day is

466
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,720
so maybe we don't care that much if the

467
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
order gets slightly rearranged or if the

468
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,279
relative popularities of different votes

469
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,000
are slightly perturbed

470
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
so on the one hand that's good

471
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,040
on the other hand what's bad for us is

472
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
that we don't wait until we get to the

473
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
end and everybody's voted and then

474
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
decrypt we really in order for the

475
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,240
system to be useful we need to have a

476
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,839
kind of

477
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
stack overflow like or reddit like kind

478
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,480
of ongoing telling happening so people

479
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
can see what else is popular and decide

480
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
whether they would have uploaded or

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
downloaded or not

482
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
so we need to decrypt

483
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,760
in small batches as we go rather than in

484
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,079
one big batch at the end

485
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,959
uh it's also just part of the way it's

486
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
designed that the system will reveal

487
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
that you voted on a particular question

488
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
it won't reveal whether you up whether

489
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,799
you

490
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,199
voted a one or a zero but it will reveal

491
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
that you posted a cipher text in

492
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,240
relation to that question

493
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,120
and also this kind of ongoing

494
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,640
nature of the interaction makes a lot of

495
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
the usual kind of privacy analysis and

496
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,799
privacy guarantees hard right we don't

497
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,320
know how many more votes a person is

498
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
going to cast as they go and we don't

499
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,880
know

500
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
uh what their fraction of uploading on

501
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
town funding is going to be

502
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,039
okay so here are

503
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,520
here are four plans of varying levels of

504
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
working versus being acceptable so this

505
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,200
one i know how to do

506
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
suppose we just don't do anything we

507
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
just do it anyway right pick a big batch

508
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
decrypt in the batch

509
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,039
and

510
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
publish the answer

511
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
so

512
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,600
in the absolute best case

513
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,840
if we let p be the fraction of overall

514
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,400
um votes that are that are ones

515
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
supposing they're ones and zeros then

516
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
the probability that they're unanimous

517
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,240
is at least this expression that i've

518
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
written here which is dead obvious and

519
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it's probably going to be worse than

520
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
that actually because this assumes that

521
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
they're all you know that they're all uh

522
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,840
independently distributed when in fact

523
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
they're probably highly correlated so

524
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,360
we've got some probability that it's

525
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,640
unanimous

526
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
odd that that any one batch is unanimous

527
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
and we know that if somebody

528
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
participates regularly in a variety of

529
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
different batches then sooner or later

530
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,039
they're going to

531
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
end up in a unanimous batch

532
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,480
or probably several unanimous matches

533
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,559
so this is kind of option one is we say

534
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,240
well

535
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
we're just going to do it anyway

536
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,360
okay option two

537
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,039
is

538
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,679
we add some random padding bits before

539
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,600
we decrypt so let's say we take our

540
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,960
uniformly and independently generated

541
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,919
random bits and we add a batch of them

542
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,240
on at the top so effectively a sort of

543
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,760
random vote from let's say from the same

544
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,880
telling authorities that are already um

545
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
holding the decryption key

546
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,840
and then we tally the batch the batch of

547
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
real votes plus the random votes

548
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
and uh it doesn't really mess with

549
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
verifiability because we can still

550
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,720
because everybody gets the

551
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,760
decryption of t plus r over two and then

552
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,679
everybody can subtract off r over two

553
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,919
and we don't alter the average

554
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,840
although we might mess with the

555
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,559
relative

556
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,440
popularities of certain votes a little

557
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,799
bit on the average we don't change

558
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,080
anything

559
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,559
and um

560
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
that's better so that's better it's not

561
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
perfect so you can if you do the

562
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,640
analysis you can see it's epsilon delta

563
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
differentially private but with a

564
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,840
non-negligible delta so the uh delta

565
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,799
here

566
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,159
relies on

567
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,760
the reason that

568
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,000
there's a non-zero delta is that you can

569
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
still get unanimity so you can obviously

570
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,120
still have at the case where everybody

571
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,360
everybody uploaded it and also all of

572
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,039
the random bits happen to turn out to be

573
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,840
one

574
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
and so then the adversary can

575
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,880
immediately see that everybody else

576
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
right so it doesn't take the unanimity

577
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,919
risk away it just makes it a little bit

578
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,919
less likely

579
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,880
okay so that's plan b

580
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,600
plan c which is really the proper way to

581
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
do it

582
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,039
is to apply the laplace mechanism on

583
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,960
each question which is this very very

584
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,600
classical correct differentially private

585
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,400
thing

586
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
uh and if you choose

587
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
some random noise from this distribution

588
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,280
in a verifiable way you can prove that

589
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
the resulting

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,559
tally is differentially private with

591
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,799
zero delta and with whatever level of

592
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
epsilon you choose

593
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
in the spread of the laplace

594
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
distribution

595
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,559
so this seems nice

596
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,720
but then it's

597
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,840
a little bit of a challenge to think

598
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,679
about how to do that in a verifiable way

599
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,640
even that is not uh completely perfect

600
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,760
because

601
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,120
that's only a one-shot thing whereas we

602
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
possibly the actual right way to do it

603
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
is to think about one person's

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
contribution to multiple different

605
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,360
questions so one person's record as a

606
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
vector of their contributions across

607
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
multiple different questions but i don't

608
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,159
know how to deal with that because that

609
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,280
grows as we go

610
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,200
and then finally there's obviously this

611
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,919
question of how do you generate this

612
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,120
random

613
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
perturbations in a verifiable way so

614
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,600
that you can prove to people that on the

615
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,960
average you haven't uh biased the

616
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
apparent popularity of some questions

617
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,799
rather than others i'd love to hear

618
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,240
suggestions for how to do that well i

619
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,799
mean i can think of ways to do it but i

620
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
bet there are ways to do it better than

621
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,080
whatever we've thought of

622
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,440
so really that's the end of the

623
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,120
presentation uh if you'd like to get

624
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
more uh involved or contact me about the

625
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000

626
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
here's the github repo and my email
