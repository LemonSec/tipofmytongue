00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,919
hello thank you for tuning in my name is

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,640
raquel hassan presenting our paper

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
understanding utility and privacy of

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,759
demographic data in education technology

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
by causal analysis and adversarial

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
sensory this is a joint work with mario

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,240
fruits

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
so education technologies can be defined

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
as technologies used in educational

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,279
context and they are pretty much

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,080
everywhere in various forms for example

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
canvas is one of the most popular

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,479
learning event management systems used

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,719
in higher educational institutes mostly

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
google classroom provides complete

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,120
virtual custom management solutions that

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
doubled its user base during the

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,399
pandemic

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
class dozo is also one of the most

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,039
popular applications for

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
monitoring children in school it rewards

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,719
kids for quote unquote good behaviors

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
and punishes them for bad behaviors

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
he helped us that's my favorite so it

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,320
tracks students movements in campus

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,039
buildings and hallways including when

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,199
they visit bathrooms

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,920
and jointly all these four applications

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,320
have more than

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,280
230 million users and here is a bigger

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,759
picture so it was estimated that the 8

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,479
tech market will exceed 341 billion u.s

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
dollar by 2025 but the pandemic further

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
accelerated that growth to more than 400

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
billion us dollar

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
and simultaneously we are seeing an

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
increasing number of privacy evaluating

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
incidents many incidents involve

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
databases hacking and so on but a lot of

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
incidents involve data abuses by 8 tech

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,479
vendors or their business partners for

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
profit

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
so the natural question is then why so

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,079
much data are being collected

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,439
and the

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
reason put forward by a tech vendors and

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
their partner institutes are building

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,079
models to predict students performance

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
or who among them will likely drop out

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
from a course or to recommend

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
appropriate course personalized books

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
and so on

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,840
so these models are trained using data

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,160
such as how students interacted with

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
learning management systems or online

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,560
portals their activities and movements

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,120
and even highly private data like their

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
demographic and background information

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
so the claim is that such learning

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,560
analytics will help student retention

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,000
and improve the overall educational

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
experiences

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
and these are seemingly novel causes

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
although many scholars in education

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
law and computer science

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
are good that most of these technologies

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
are not scientifically evaluated and may

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
actually harm students

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
but even if these tools have the

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
potential to be useful the question we

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,640
asked in this paper is do they really

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,519
need all this data

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,000
uh in this paper we show that the

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
privacy sensitive demographic attributes

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,239
such as gender age they are not really

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,400
required to predict performance or drop

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,440
or probability or any other outcome so

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
consequently we argue against collecting

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
such information

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,840
but

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,000
we also found that such attributes can

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,879
be inferred based on how students

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,959
interacted with the learning management

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,239
system

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,440
so we we propose a method to prevent

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
such inferences using adversary

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
censoring and constraint optimization

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
and we demonstrated our e-village and

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
evaluated our methods on the open

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
university learning analytics data set

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,319
which is one of the most widely used

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,720
data set in the research community

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,239
it contains data

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
for from more than 32 000 students and

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
the data types include students

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760
interactions with

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
online portal like visiting course pages

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,000
assignment submissions taking part in

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
quizzes and so on their demographic data

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
like age and gender and historical data

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,720
so since most papers based on this data

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
set or other similar data sets used

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,920
gender as an input feature to predict

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,480
performance we first wanted to test if

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
gender correlates with course

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
performance

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
and the answer was yes we found

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
correlation between gender and

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
performance so the next question is

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
whether this association was causal that

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
is if students performance differed

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,199
because they differed in gender while

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
everything else such as their activities

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,759
their background and everything

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
remained constant

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
so we want to find pairs of students who

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
perform similar activities throughout

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
the semester and had similar backgrounds

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
but differed only in gender

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
let's say we have two sets of students

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
who identify with x and y genders

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,479
respectively we embed these students

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
into a vector space such that students

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
who behave similarly

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
were placed close to each other and we

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,479
paired the nearest neighbors

127
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
then we again tested if gender was

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
associated with course performance

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
within these matched samples

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,520
and the association disappeared

131
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
this means if everything else remain

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
constant gender does not have any

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
predictive value

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
by extension whatever predictive value

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,720
it had before it was most likely due to

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
the encoding of some demographic biases

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
but unfortunately gender can be inferred

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
from behavioral data a very basic

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
logistic regression model can predict

140
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,720
gender with over 73 accuracy which is a

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
39

142
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
improvement over the bayesian accuracy

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,039
a three-layer deep neural net can

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,080
predict uh increase the accuracy to 76

145
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,240
percent and more sophisticated models

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,039
will likely predict uh even more

147
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,520
accurately and the data set we were

148
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
using is much much smaller than data

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,639
sets collected by large a tech providers

150
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
so we want to find a way that will allow

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
collecting or sharing this data for this

152
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
kind of data for research purposes

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
without risking students privacy so we

154
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
have three sub goals the first one is to

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
prevent inference attacks or inferring

156
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,560
sensitive attributes

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
second goal is preserving utility which

158
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
means allowing building these kind of

159
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,360
predictive models and the third goal is

160
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
to

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
identify a subset of the features

162
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,479
that satisfy the first two conditions so

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
the final outcome is a small subset of

164
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,600
the input features that can be used

165
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
or that are enough to

166
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
build learning analytics but not to inf

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
that they cannot be used to infer gender

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
and so the collected data can be shared

169
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
with other business partners or research

170
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
partners

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
so to achieve the first two goals we

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
applied an adversarial sensory technique

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
so similar to typical neural networks we

174
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
have our input features they are fed

175
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,800
into intermediate layers and then to the

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,280
output layer that predicts performance

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
but we simultaneously predict students

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,960
gender

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,639
during training the gradients are

180
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
updated as usual to improve performance

181
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
prediction at every iteration but for

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,479
gender prediction we did the reverse

183
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
gradient update as a result the model

184
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
gets worse in predicting gender over

185
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
time

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
to identify a subset of these features

187
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
we used a feature selection layer so

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
that was inserted between the input

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,080
layer and the other intermediate layers

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,960
let's look more closely at

191
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,039
how this layer operates so there are n

192
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,680
nodes in this layer n can be anything

193
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880
any number so all features independently

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
enter into this node and the node

195
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,199
parameters

196
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,680
were constrained to be either zero or

197
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,199
one that means

198
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
features with associated parameter

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,000
values 0 will simply be discarded

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
and the nodes also

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
have linear activation function so that

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
means

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,319
each node's output is just a sum of all

204
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
the input features that survived the

205
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
feature selection process so this

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
property of the model may enhance its

207
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,240
interpretability because by looking at

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
how different features combined

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
we can get an idea or education experts

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
can get an idea of how collection of

211
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,639
interactions create meaningful behaviors

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
for better learning

213
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,280
so going back to the feature selection

214
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
this is the penalty function that we

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,000
used in the feature selection layer so

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
observe that the penalty function is

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
minimum

218
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
when the parameter value is either zero

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
or one

220
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
so now the good news is that using this

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
model we could prevent gender inference

222
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
uh you can see the

223
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
performance prediction and general

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,480
prediction gender prediction accuracy is

225
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
at the

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
baseline level or chance level for

227
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,240
comparison we change two sets of models

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
to independently predict performance and

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
gender you can see that the constraint

230
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
model varies performance with the same

231
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
accuracy as other models while bringing

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
down the gender inference accuracy to

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,399
the chance level

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
now for goal 3 we want to know which

235
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
features are right we found that only

236
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,800
three nodes

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,240
had uh some non nonzero parameters all

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
other nodes had all zero parameters

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
after applying the penalty function so

240
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,839
in those three nodes only six unique

241
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,920
features survived this process and their

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
combinations were passed to the

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
subsequent layers that means

244
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,279
only six features are enough to predict

245
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
performance

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,719
while not risking students privacy

247
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
so now we examine how generalizable and

248
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
robust our approach is we in the paper

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
we provide cross validation results over

250
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
randomized data speeds as well as show

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
how generalization of our approach

252
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,600
to other settings and tasks so but very

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
briefly we

254
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
follow similar approach to predict

255
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,600
performance while preventing age group

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,959
inference

257
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,079
and to predict dropout probability of

258
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,920
students while preventing gender

259
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
inference so these are very different

260
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
tasks

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
but each time we operate similar results

262
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
and all experiments are done hundreds of

263
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
times with randomized initializations

264
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
and trained test speeds so

265
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,800
uh these datas provide the

266
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,720
generalizability and robustness evidence

267
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
of our approach

268
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
in summary

269
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
it takes are already ubiquitous in many

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
countries and will be the same globally

271
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,040
in the coming years students many of who

272
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
are too young to consent for data

273
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
collection or even to understand the

274
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
consequences will continue to be

275
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
massively surveilled in the name of

276
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,519
improving education

277
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,680
so in this paper we demonstrated that

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
learning analytics can be done while

279
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
protecting privacy

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
but we need much more research efforts

281
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
to close those invasive surveillance

282
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
eyes before technologies take over

283
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,040
education like many other social

284
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
institutes thank you so much for your

285
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
attention
