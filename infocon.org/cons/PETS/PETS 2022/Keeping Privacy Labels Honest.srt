1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,799
welcome to the talk keeping privacy

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,359
labels honest this was a collaboration

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
between malta vessels benjamin alpeter

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,240
mediterra olverman martin nunes and me

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
simoncor

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,039
in the end of 2020 apple introduced

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,720
privacy labels privacy labels are

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,000
self-declaration by app developers

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
concerning the data an app collects

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
while you as the user are using the app

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
if you have a look at the app store page

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,200
of an app here as an example

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
the app store app of candy crush

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,239
you see below the ratings and reviews a

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,280
section called app privacy

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,239
the app privacy section visualizes the

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
data declared in the privacy label by

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,320
the app developer

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
however this is only the course overview

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,120
and if you click on details

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,440
you actually get a full overview and as

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,000
you can see privacy labels potentially

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
contain a lot of information concerning

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
data that is collected from you the user

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
while you're using the app

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,920
so what data is actually collected

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,880
by an app and told by the privacy labels

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
well privacy label can tell you this it

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
tells you how why and what data is

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
collected

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,040
the how explained how the data is later

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
on used

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,280
the y details the purpose and the what

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
actually details the data is collected

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
so on the how you can for example have

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
data is not collected meaning that the

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
app will not collect any data while

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439
you're using it the privacy label can

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,759
have a section on data that is used to

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,720
track you this data will later on be

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
linked up with third party data

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
next you can have a section containing

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
data that is not linked to you meaning

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
that all data that is contained in the

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,920
section must not be linked back to your

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
identity later on

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,600
finally you can have a section on data

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
linked to you this means that all the

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
data contained in this section

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
can and will be linked back to your

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
identity when collected

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,440
so overall we have four different how on

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
how data can be collected as detailed in

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
the privacy labels of those four

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
three can be combined data not linked to

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
you data used to track you

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and data linked to you data not

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
collected is mutually exclusive with the

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,040
remaining three

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
next we have the why the purpose on why

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
data is collected and as an example we

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
have a look at the section detailing

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
data collected not linked to you and the

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,360
purposes are listed in bold below

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
first we have third party advertising

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,160
then we have developers advertising and

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
marketing and finally we have analytics

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
only the sections data not linked to you

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,080
and data linked to you actually contain

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,519
purposes

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,040
the section

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
data used to track you already contains

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
the purpose in the how

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
overall there are six different purposes

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
third-party advertising developers

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
advertising analytics product

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,000
personalization app functionality and

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
other purposes

79
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
next we have the what data is collected

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
and again coming back to our section and

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
data not linked to you

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
the what data is collected is listed

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,599
below each purpose

84
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,879
for the purpose of third party

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
advertising we have identifiers usage

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,159
data

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
the same for developers advertising or

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
marketing

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
and again the same for analytics with

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,200
the addition of diagnostics data

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
what data is collected is detailed by

92
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,680
all three data collection sections data

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
not linked to you data linked to you and

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
data used to track you remember no data

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,799
collection is mutually exclusive with

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
those three and details that no data is

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,599
collected at all

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
overall there are 14 different data

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
types that can be collected contact info

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
health and fitness financial info

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
location sensitive info contacts user

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
content browsing history search history

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
identifies purchases usage data

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,759
diagnostics and other data

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
now that we have detailed the vast

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,919
amount of information contained in a

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
privacy label we come to our research

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,280
question of which we had three

109
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,919
our first question was are privacy

110
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,400
labels reasonable what we mean by this

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,360
is can we understand what data is

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
actually collected when looking at the

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,919
privacy labels and does this make sense

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,560
and overall for the most part the answer

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,840
is yes

116
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
however when we had a look for example

117
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
at the section of data not linked to you

118
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
we saw that some apps claim that they

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
collect identifiers for example the user

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,280
id or the device id as data not linked

121
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,600
to you which we consider to be an

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
inconsistency as we cannot really

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
explain how this is supposed to be

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
possible as those identifiers

125
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
are your identity in the content context

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
of data collection

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,758
on a smartphone

128
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
second question we wanted to answer was

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,039
are there collection patterns

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
for this we downloaded large amount of

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,000
different privacy labels and run this

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
explorative statistical analysis

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
and the answer is yes we can detect

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
collection patterns

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
for example we had a look at different

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,479
game app categories for example gaming

137
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
and looked how they collect data

138
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
differently than the remaining apps

139
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,280
here you can see that game apps for

140
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,160
example really like to collect data for

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
tracking you or linked to you and do not

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,600
like to collect data not at all or

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,319
unlinked to you

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
if we had a look at the data types that

145
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
are collected by game apps you can see

146
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,039
that gameplay content is the leading

147
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
data type which is not really surprising

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
considering you're looking at gaming

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,280
apps however the next two advertising

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
data and purchase history are somewhat

151
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,720
surprising but do fit in the stereotype

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,440
of game apps

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,479
we did not only look at different app

154
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
categories but also on what data is

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
collected how and for example here we

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
had a look at what data is collected not

157
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
linked to you and you can see the three

158
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
main part types are crash data

159
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
performance data and other diagnostics

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,720
data

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
this does make sense as neither of the

162
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
data points requires to be linked to the

163
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,400
user to be actually valuable

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
if you have a look at the bottom you can

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
see the data types not popular to be

166
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,880
collected not linked to you which are

167
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
email address user id name or phone

168
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,000
number which also makes sense as those

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
are inherently linked to you

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
and cannot reasonably be collected not

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
linked to you

172
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
our third and last question was are

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
privacy labels actually enforced

174
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and for this we downloaded apps from the

175
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
app stores

176
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
leveraged freedom to install and start

177
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,919
those apps on an iphone

178
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,440
and then intercepted the traffic

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,759
for 60 seconds by running the app

180
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,479
without any further interaction we then

181
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
search that traffic for data points

182
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
listed or rather not listed in a privacy

183
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,039
label

184
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,560
and the answer is

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
no

186
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,000
privacy labels are not enforced at least

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,720
not strictly

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,039
for example we had a look at location

189
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,240
data

190
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
we ran the apps and then searched the

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,280
traffic

192
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,599
for location information

193
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
and we had for example 440 apps that

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,479
claimed in their privacy label that they

195
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
were not collecting any location data

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,759
however in 27 of those apps we detected

197
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
location data in the transmitted traffic

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
even worse we had 168 apps that claimed

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
they do not collect any data at all

200
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
and eight of those contained location

201
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,039
data in their traffic

202
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,120
overall we checked

203
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,000
1687 different apps and 16 of those

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,919
transmitted undeclared data

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
so to summarize

206
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
privacy labels are for the most part

207
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,720
reasonable but do contain some

208
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,839
inconsistencies that need further

209
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
explanation

210
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
privacy labels review collection

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
patterns when

212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
analyzed statistically

213
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
finally privacy labels are not strictly

214
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
enforced

215
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
for each of those research questions i

216
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
gave you some examples however if you go

217
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,320
on our paper each section concerning

218
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,399
those questions is more detailed and of

219
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,120
course we did run way more analysis and

220
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,000
details on those

221
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
now to the end we want to acknowledge

222
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
our funding by the european union

223
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,760
horizon 2020 research grant and the dfg

224
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,279
finally

225
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
if you want to contact me concerning our

226
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,839
research or have any further questions

227
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,480
please feel free to either email me

228
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,279
or add me on matrix

229
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
furthermore we uploaded our artifacts on

230
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
github

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
our github org for the paper contains

232
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
not only the privacy labels we

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,279
downloaded but also our source code to

234
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,680
analyze the privacy labels and run our

235
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
statistical analysis

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,680
i hope this data can provide useful

237
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
information and useful tools for future

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
researchers

239
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,640
thank you very much for your attention
