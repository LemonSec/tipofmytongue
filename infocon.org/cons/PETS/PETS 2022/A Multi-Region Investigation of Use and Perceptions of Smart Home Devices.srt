00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,360
welcome i am tom wenzel from the

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,680
technical university of munich

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,839
i am presenting our research on smart

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,080
home devices conducted with my fellow

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
student patrick bombic and our advisors

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,559
ian's kosklox from the technical

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,039
university of munich and samir patel

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
from the university of utah

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,199
recent years have seen a proliferation

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
of smart home devices with everyday

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,000
household objects and appliances such as

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
tvs light bulbs doorbells coffee makers

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,399
etc getting augmented with internet

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,760
connectivity and interactive

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
capabilities

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
a network of such devices creates what

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
is commonly known as the internet of

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,440
things or iot

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,000
for the purposes of our study we define

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
a smart home device as a hardware

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
software combination deployed within a

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,399
home to perform one or more of a broad

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,480
range of domestic functions

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
as such smart home devices may combine

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,160
and automate routine domestic tasks to

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,320
increase the quality safety and

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,959
efficiency of domestic life

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,280
smart home devices are by definition

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,799
embedded within a home

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
the most intimate and personal settings

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
therefore the benefits and convenience

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
they provide must be balanced with

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
considerations of privacy and security

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
from the user as well as regulatory

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,240
point of view

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
data protection regulations as well as

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
user privacy expectations differ across

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,360
regions

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
yet existing studies of these issues

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
have typically involved samples from a

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
single region

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960
often with a focus on a single device

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
such as a smart speaker

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
our research attempts to fill this gap

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
with a multi-region investigation of the

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,920
perceptions and use of smart home

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,759
devices in general

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,320
specifically we examine three research

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
questions

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
the first research question focused on

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
the relationships between perceptions

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,320
and use of smart home devices with

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,719
perceived regulatory protection which we

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
measured using three leica type items

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
covering protection from unwanted

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
third-party data access

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,318
sharing and processing

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,879
we hypothesized that higher perceived

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,040
regulatory protection would alleviate

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
concerns and raise comfort

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
so it would be positively associated

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,160
with

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,360
positive perceptions adoption

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
as well as use

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
our second research question examined

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
whether variations in user expectations

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
and practices

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,560
as well as the regulatory environment

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
across regions can influence the

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
perceptions and use of smart home

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
devices

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
we hypothesized that regional variations

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
will lead to differences in

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
perceptions

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
adoption

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
and use of smart home devices across

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
regions

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
our third research question was aimed at

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
examining how perceptions and use of

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
smart home devices might be affected by

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,280
various characteristics of the home

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
itself

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
in particular we looked at the influence

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
of whether the user owns or rents the

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
home the number of people that live in

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
the home and the number of children

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
present in the home

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
we hypothesized that owning a home

89
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
and having more people living in the

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,400
home

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
will be associated with higher positive

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
perceptions greater adoption and more

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
use smart home devices

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
in contrast we conjectured that the

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,239
presence of children is likely to be

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
associated negatively with these aspects

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
we operationalize the measures for the

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
independent and dependent variables

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,080
connected to our research questions and

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
associated hypothesis

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,159
in the form of an online questionnaire

102
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
those who consented to answer the

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
questionnaire after reading information

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,319
about the study first indicated

105
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,319
which smart home devices they owned from

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,000
a list of 20 most popular smart home

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
devices

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
next we ask questions about the purchase

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
and use of three specific devices chosen

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
at random

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
after that participants provided

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
responses regarding general attitudes

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
and preferences regarding smart home

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,319
devices

115
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,040
and perceptions of regulatory protection

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
for the data connected to these devices

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,238
to gather measures of baseline privacy

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,199
and security preferences and practices

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
we've included two standard scales from

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
the literature

121
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
the security behavior intention scale

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
that is sebis

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
and the mobile user's internet privacy

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
concern scale that is muipc

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
at the end we collected standard

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,479
demographics along with household

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,479
characteristics

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,720
use the prolific crowd work platform to

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,479
advertise the questionnaire to those

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,560
based in the united states united

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
kingdom

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
or in the german-speaking countries in

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
europe that is germany austria and

134
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
switzerland

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
after applying data integrity checks the

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,680
valid responses are roughly evenly

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,440
distributed across these regions with

138
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,880
143 responses from the united states

139
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
155 from the united kingdom

140
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
and 133 from the german speaking that is

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,800
gs region

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
overall

143
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,800
233 participants identified as female

144
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,199
195 is male and three is non-binary

145
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,680
upon examining the data we found that

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
many of the devices were owned by too

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
few of the participants to provide

148
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
sufficient statistical power to examine

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,960
their use

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
we therefore restricted our analysis for

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,039
the use variable to the three devices

152
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
reported to be owned by a large number

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,479
of participants

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,440
with 231 reporting that they owned a

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,639
smart tv

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
140 owning a smart speaker and 92

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,919
mentioned that they own a smart light

158
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,039
bulb

159
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,319
the sub sample of the 329 participants

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
who owned at least one of these three

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
devices provided sufficient statistical

162
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
power to examine use

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
we used the full set of 431 responses

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
for all other analyses

165
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,120
in this presentation we provide the

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,680
major high level insight based on the

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
statistically significant results from

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,360
the analyses

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,680
please consult the paper for the detail

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
regarding these analyses and the

171
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
corresponding statistical tests

172
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
when examining associations with

173
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,880
perceived regulatory protection we found

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
that higher perceived protection was

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
associated with positive perceptions

176
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
however the strength of the association

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
can vary across devices based on

178
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,880
variations in perceived privacy risk

179
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
in addition we found that greater

180
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
perceived intrusion as measured by muipc

181
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
is associated with users ascribing

182
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
greater responsibility to manufacturers

183
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,400
for providing private and secure device

184
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
operation

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
in line with our hypothesis

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
we found perceived regulatory protection

187
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,080
to be associated positively with

188
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,039
adoption of smart home devices as well

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,720
the association is present for

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
regulatory protection overall but not

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
when separately examining the items for

192
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
third party data access

193
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,599
sharing and processing

194
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
the results suggest that the various

195
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
aspects of data handling covered by

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
regulatory protection can create a

197
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
cumulative influence stronger than that

198
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
for each of the aspects considered

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
separately

200
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
we found a similar positive relationship

201
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
between perceived regulatory protection

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,560
and use of smart home devices but only

203
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
for some devices

204
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,720
interestingly the results suggest that

205
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
the relationship might be present for

206
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
devices that provide more complex

207
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
functionality and interactive

208
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
capabilities

209
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
such as smart tvs

210
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,240
but not for single function ones such as

211
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
smart light bulbs

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
taken together these results provide

213
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,759
general support of the hypotheses

214
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
related to the first research question

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
next we split the data by region and

216
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,479
compared the samples from the three

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,560
regions we covered in the research

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,039
we found that perceptions adoption and

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,919
use differed across three regions as we

220
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,520
hypothesized

221
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,759
when examined in depth we found regional

222
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
differences in expected privacy risks

223
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,039
as well as benefits of the devices

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,960
we similarly found that the positive

225
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
association between perceived regulatory

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
protection and adoption holds only for

227
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,840
the german-speaking region but not for

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,799
the united states and the united kingdom

229
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,200
their use of smart home devices in fact

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,958
showed no statistically significant

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
differences in general across the three

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,479
regions

233
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
the difference in use we observed can be

234
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,040
attributed to the sole exception of the

235
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,399
smart tv

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
which was reported to be used less in

237
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
the german-speaking region

238
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
at a high level we found that

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
perceptions adoption and use of smart

240
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
home devices differ between the german

241
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
speaking and the english-speaking

242
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,640
regions in our study with the united

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
states and the united kingdom typically

244
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
exhibiting no statistically significant

245
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,240
differences

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
when analyzing the influence of

247
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
characteristics of the home

248
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
we found that home ownership is

249
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,279
associated with greater adoption of

250
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
smart home devices

251
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
we similarly found a positive

252
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,399
relationship between number of people in

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,360
the household and adoption

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
these results are in line with our

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,519
hypotheses but only for adoption as we

256
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
found no statistically significant

257
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
relationships between homeownership and

258
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,399
size and perceptions in use

259
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,880
contrary to our hypotheses

260
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
we found that the presence of children

261
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,519
in the household was associated with

262
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
greater adoption as well as greater use

263
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
specifically we found that parents

264
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
reported greater use of smart tvs and

265
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
showed a greater preference for

266
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
voice-based interaction with smart home

267
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
devices via smart speakers or voice

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
assistance

269
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
we wish to thank the study participants

270
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,079
for their time and effort in responding

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,600
to the study

272
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
we are also grateful for funding from

273
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
the bavarian research institute for

274
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
digital transformation and the bavarian

275
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,200
state ministry for science and arts

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
in summary in our investigation of the

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,560
perceptions and use of smart home

278
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
devices covering the united states

279
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
united kingdom and the german-speaking

280
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,959
region in europe we found positive

281
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
associations with perceived regulatory

282
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
protection for the data connected to

283
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,399
these devices

284
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,240
however perceptions and use differ

285
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
across regions

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
home ownership household size and

287
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
presence of children influence adoption

288
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
but not the perceptions and use of smart

289
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,000
home devices

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,519
these findings can be applied for

291
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
devising various enhancements in the

292
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
design of smart home devices as well as

293
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,279
public policy measures to achieve to

294
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,959
bring the data handling of smart home

295
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,279
devices in better alignment with user

296
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,040
expectations regarding privacy and

297
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,480
security

298
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,399
for further detail we encourage you to
