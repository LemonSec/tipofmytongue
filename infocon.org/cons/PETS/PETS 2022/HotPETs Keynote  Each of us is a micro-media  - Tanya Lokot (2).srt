1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
it's a big honor and probably also

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,879
somewhat of a of a of a way to be the

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,160
final speaker of such a such an amazing

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,840
conference I've been picking into some

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,160
of the various things that have been

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,320
happening over the the days of the

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,700
conference and it looks like you guys

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,980
were having a lot of fun

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,160
um so obviously also what I'm here to do

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,380
um is to you know put a social science

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,939
bin on things

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,420
um so I will preface this by saying that

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,179
um I am not a techie person I am I am

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,279
more of a dabbler and even though I'm

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,960
really interested in digital media and

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,180
privacy in particular as as one of the

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,020
kind of key tenets of people's existence

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,840
and in the hybrid media spaces

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,420
um I am by no means a person who

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,160
understands or professes to understand

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,980
how algorithms work or or how to how to

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,379
write code I do however have a keen

23
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,879
interest in how people use technology

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,320
and this is what I'm going to talk about

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,640
today

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,859
um so the title of my talk is each of us

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,559
is a micro media and it's about citizen

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,260
mobilization as media practices in the

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,600
context of Russia's war in Ukraine

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
um and the the first part of the title

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,240
comes from a tweet that um one of my

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,220
Ukrainian acquaintances posted on on

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,400
Twitter a few months ago when the war

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,680
um in in Ukraine was a full-fledged war

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,520
was already very much underway

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,720
she posted the tweet and she said look

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
each of us is in micro media we we are

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,460
here not just as Twitter users but we're

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,460
here to to share information about the

40
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,799
war we're here to to tell people about

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
what's going on

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,579
you know and so that that puts special

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,619
responsibilities on on active social

44
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,079
media users and it made me think about

45
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,960
you know how you think about what people

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,020
do on social media during crises and and

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,880
you know especially military conflicts

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
because of course

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
um social media uses something we do on

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
a daily basis and we tend to think about

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,100
it as something routine and there's a

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,899
lot of research on routine uses of

53
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,360
social media in everyday life but

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,799
increasingly what we're also seeing is

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,380
that there are certain moments when

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,619
social media use becomes less anything

57
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,260
but routine and and that usually tends

58
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,720
to happen during say protests or during

59
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,599
elections or during

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,700
um you know natural disasters and also

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,200
during Wars

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,580
um and so I think it's really important

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,520
to to really focus our thinking about

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,620
how we understand what happens to

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,019
people's social media use uh what

66
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,700
happens to their perception of social

67
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,300
media platforms and their affordances in

68
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,879
these crisis moments and how it changes

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,819
what people do on social media and with

70
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,680
social media so that's what I'm going to

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
talk about today

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
and the context for for this war

73
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,800
obviously is for the for the stock is

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,780
the war that Russia is waging in Ukraine

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,840
and to give you just a brief

76
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,959
um kind of bit of background Russia

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,959
first invaded Ukraine back in 2014 and

78
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,680
it um occupied the Crimean Peninsular in

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,760
Ukraine and some some land in in eastern

80
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,980
Ukraine and so those territories have

81
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,840
been occupied by Russian forces and for

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,300
Russian forces since 2014 but the

83
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,780
conflict started kind of as a military

84
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,580
conflict but then it's sort of similared

85
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,800
you know with minor confrontations

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
however in February this year since

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,580
February 24th Russia also started a

88
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,680
full-scale invasion of Ukraine and it's

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,799
been attacking various parts of Ukraine

90
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,019
across the very very large territory of

91
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,360
Ukraine from the East to the west and

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,879
obviously a lot more territories are

93
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,819
currently occupied up to and including

94
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,640
you know some some large Regional

95
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,500
centers

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,319
so this has been going on since the end

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,159
of February so we're now in month five

98
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,580
of the war and so how we understand

99
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,439
people's participation and conflicts and

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,060
in this war obviously it doesn't just

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,500
stop at you know people taking

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,580
Apartments

103
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,099
um or soldiers fighting other soldiers

104
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,680
um in the field uh what we Now

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,819
understand

106
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,180
the quality of War to be is that it is

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,279
very much also an A type of

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,680
participatory Warfare something that

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,019
William Marin describes as

110
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,759
a kind of warfare that offers

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,800
opportunities for different kinds of

112
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
participation and expands those

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,139
opportunities so very much this also

114
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,180
involves participating through mediative

115
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,280
means

116
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,660
not just in the traditional way where

117
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,520
people watch the television news every

118
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
night and look at what's happening and

119
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,139
participate in that way but also active

120
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,900
participation you know by sharing

121
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,479
certain kinds of information by using

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,759
social media and other media to

123
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,280
fundraise for instance for the war

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,759
effort or to call for justice when we're

125
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,100
talking about you know war crimes and

126
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,560
crimes against humanity and Russia's war

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,660
in Ukraine has very much been this kind

128
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,580
of participatory War

129
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,280
and we we already have some research

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,039
that tells us that Ukrainian citizens in

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,360
particular are on a Grassroots level

132
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,419
have relied on the openness and power of

133
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,340
existing horizontal networks in the

134
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,740
Ukrainian Society to mobilize our

135
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Collective action and to do so away from

136
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,900
our alongside centralized Authority so

137
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,780
this tradition exists in in Ukrainian

138
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,759
society and in the Ukrainian digital

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
Sphere for quite some time

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,860
these kind of aggressive horizontal

141
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,620
networks and Civil Society connections

142
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,199
have existed for a while because

143
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,479
obviously there is a kind of history of

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,300
protests in in Ukraine most notably the

145
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,620
euromaidan protests in 2013 and 2013

146
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,479
immediately after which the the conflict

147
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,560
started

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,600
and so these networks are very important

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,500
because they don't remain the same they

150
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,539
change and new people come into the

151
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,060
networks but they are resilient exactly

152
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,060
because they're more informal and they

153
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
exist alongside centralized authorities

154
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,259
so they're not dependent on government

155
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,840
or or state officials it's actually

156
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,639
quite the opposite it's you know the

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,020
government and the state officials in

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,759
Ukraine have come to rely on these

159
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,759
informal or some more some less formal

160
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,880
horizontal Civic networks

161
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,800
obviously participatory awards are also

162
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,020
characterized by high levels of digital

163
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,840
and social media use and media activity

164
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,060
and in this war in particular we have

165
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,199
seen incredibly intense social media

166
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
activity and digital media use by

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
governments on both sides and even by

168
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
governments and other actors who are not

169
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
actually you know not neither in Ukraine

170
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
or in Russia but elsewhere

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,979
also these media are used going military

172
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,199
actors media outlets and of course

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,720
ordinary citizens as well and it's the

174
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,160
citizens that I would really like to

175
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
focus on today so we know right there's

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,680
opportunities for participation we know

177
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,660
that there's a high intensity of media

178
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,199
use but how do we think about

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
understanding what the citizens actually

180
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,000
do you know when they become

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,039
participants in in the war when they

182
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,380
become participants in the war through

183
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,800
the means of offered by social media

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,080
and my suggestion here is that we think

185
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,120
about

186
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,560
understanding how citizens come together

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,039
and mobilize in participatory work but

188
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,539
it's useful to think about it through

189
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,400
the lens of media practices which is a

190
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,340
term that has been used in media studies

191
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,139
and communication studies for quite some

192
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,599
time and has even made its way into some

193
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,099
adjacent disciplines such as social

194
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,919
movement studies and obviously internet

195
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,660
studies as well

196
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,599
I think this term is useful because it

197
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,759
allows us to better understand

198
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,319
specifically how media politics and

199
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,280
Civic action intersect for citizens who

200
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
are mobilizing through participating in

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,740
in conflicts and wars

202
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,960
and because we are dealing with trying

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,940
to understand not just how they use a

204
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,580
single platform or a single tool but we

205
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,800
want to understand the complex ecosystem

206
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,539
of various tools and platforms that

207
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,000
citizens use

208
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,440
also accounting for the fact that

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,000
citizens have different levels of

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,280
digital literacy and they have different

211
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,340
levels of how how Keen of a user they

212
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,199
are of a particular platform how

213
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,360
comfortable they are and how these are

214
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,599
used to support these activities that

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,339
are often goal oriented and we'll talk

216
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,559
about the goals in just a second but

217
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,479
sometimes they're targeted and strategic

218
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,820
and sometimes they're impromptu and

219
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,799
they're you know they're absolutely kind

220
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,839
of on the spot on things that people

221
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,880
come up with in order to Aid they're

222
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
mobilizing at

223
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,380
I think also media practices are useful

224
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,740
because they don't just look at the

225
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,320
macro level processes they don't just

226
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
look at oh you know here's this

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,940
transformation is occurring in society

228
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,920
or something is happening on a large

229
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,920
scale but media practices allow us to

230
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,899
really look drill down and look at the

231
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,459
agency of individuals in small

232
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,279
communities which arguably you know as a

233
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,779
social scientist I think is a more

234
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,180
productive approach compared to the

235
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,399
prevailing turn of what we're seeing and

236
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
how conflicts are studied we know where

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,060
people are looking at these geopolitical

238
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,339
Grand narratives they're looking at

239
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,279
wartime communication disinformation and

240
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
propaganda media manipulation and that's

241
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,019
all useful and it's really important and

242
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,300
it's part of the picture but what often

243
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,760
gets missed is this this really small

244
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,740
scale action and these small-scale

245
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,420
activities and practices which I think

246
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,420
should and deserve to be also you know

247
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,319
be in the spotlight

248
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,180
so a little bit about the concepts of

249
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,519
media practices

250
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,740
um obviously you know it it originated

251
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,040
on on the one hand from media studies on

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
the other hand it builds on earlier

253
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
scholarship that looks at Social

254
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
practices of mobilization so we have the

255
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
social practices

256
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,180
um that you know have been studied for

257
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,980
decades by by social scientists looking

258
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,019
at social movement organizations and

259
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,779
protests and we know you know some of

260
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,640
the core social practices for

261
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,380
mobilization their participants

262
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,220
foreign

263
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,800
movements or membership organizations

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
um you know staging protests engaging in

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
other symbolic activities so all of this

266
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,600
all of this knowledge exists already but

267
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,140
then we also have this other framework

268
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,000
of media practices which was originally

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,459
suggested by

270
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,959
advice which suggests that it's useful

271
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,839
to understand media not just as channels

272
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,880
of information whereas platforms or as

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,700
texts but as practices as a combination

274
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,839
of practices and to understand how media

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
uses arrange combine and more generally

276
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,959
intersect with other social practices so

277
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,579
we're not just looking at media and

278
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,940
isolation where as platforms or sex but

279
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,160
we're looking at them when they

280
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,560
intersect with other social practices in

281
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,240
our case right mobilization and

282
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,060
participation and then how people use

283
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,339
media both as consumers and as

284
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,820
generators of media content to

285
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,399
um you know to to enhance those social

286
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,779
practices

287
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,640
and it's also useful because media

288
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,220
practice as a theory suggests that there

289
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,800
are several different temporalities that

290
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
we can look at media practices in

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,519
there's you know the long term the

292
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,800
medium term in the short term

293
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,519
um

294
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
so we can look at Transformations and

295
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,240
changes you know in terms of different

296
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,200
temporalities what are some of the

297
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,779
practices that happen on on a daily

298
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,060
basis and then what are some some of the

299
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,459
transformations in media use and media

300
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,500
production and media broadcasting that

301
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,200
take place over time and media practices

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
are also useful because they suggest

303
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,680
that we can look at several different

304
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,440
levels right we can look at the macro

305
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
level which is the kind of geopolitical

306
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,779
medium Market media system level where

307
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,459
changes happen you know where freedom of

308
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,800
speech becomes something that is under

309
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,079
threat and that changes the whole game

310
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,420
we can also look at meso levels so we

311
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,100
can look at media organizations we can

312
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,660
look at you know independent journalism

313
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,880
we can look at open source intelligence

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,920
efforts so all different kinds of

315
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,740
organizational actors that participate

316
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,620
in in the in the hybrid media system but

317
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,000
we can also look at the micro level

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,980
right and this is the level that I'm

319
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,660
particularly interested in we can look

320
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,720
at the media practices of individuals

321
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,279
um

322
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,139
and this very much aligns with what

323
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,180
Alice mattoni and Emiliano Trey call

324
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,220
activist media practices right so when

325
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,800
they look at social movement studies

326
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,980
um at particular ways that activists

327
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,560
engaged with different media tools and

328
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,820
platforms

329
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,740
they suggested that it's really useful

330
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,800
to understand this micro level because

331
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,860
it gives you an inkling of all of the

332
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,839
different routinized and creative social

333
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,720
practices that include interactions with

334
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
media objects and that then generate or

335
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,600
appropriate media messages and

336
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,339
interactions with other media subjects

337
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,680
to reach the specific goals that a

338
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,600
certain activist Collective or a certain

339
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,820
social movement sets for themselves

340
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,680
so you know this is the kind of

341
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,540
framework that I'm applying when I'm

342
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,300
looking at the activities and the media

343
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,000
practices of Ukrainian citizens in in

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,060
the ongoing war and it's really

345
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,660
important to hear right that this is

346
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,360
we're talking about routinized practices

347
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
so a lot of the practices that we will

348
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,980
see there's something that these people

349
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,260
do on a daily basis anyway and they've

350
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,420
adopted them or changed them in order to

351
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,940
serve um you know the certain the goals

352
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,060
they've set for their participatory uh

353
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,220
war effort but they're also incredibly

354
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,740
creative and they always always involve

355
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,839
interactions with media objects and in

356
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,639
our case most likely digital media

357
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,220
objects but also interactions with other

358
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
individuals and other organizations that

359
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,699
are part of part of participatory work

360
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,160
so many practices are also really useful

361
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,980
as a concept because we can understand

362
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,100
them not just as something that involves

363
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
media use but something that is also

364
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,040
actively political right

365
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,860
um and really understanding that

366
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,199
pretty much any citizen Media or

367
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,139
communicative practices in Wartime

368
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,820
when people are joining this

369
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,279
participatory Warfare environment

370
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,740
all of these practices are necessarily

371
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,980
political because as Natalie Fenton

372
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,959
suggests they actively socialize the

373
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,120
political so they take the political

374
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,180
agenda from that macro level from those

375
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,800
you know messages that the governments

376
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,660
are exchanging and they bring it down to

377
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,459
Citizen level to individual level and

378
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,620
re-socialize those political messages

379
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,839
what is important about understanding

380
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,120
citizen individual media practices as

381
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,800
politics is that

382
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,079
they're also able very often because

383
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,360
it's a Grassroots effort to push against

384
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,399
mainstream media Logics and even

385
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,760
platform algorithmic Logics right

386
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
so it's really important because very

387
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,480
often when we talk about the mainstream

388
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,480
media agenda we can see certain patterns

389
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,300
in how Wars are covered that become you

390
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,199
know

391
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,740
um kind of boring and become

392
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,259
you know routine and again

393
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,139
um don't necessarily achieve the desired

394
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,579
effect right because there are certain

395
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,800
media Logics in how Wars are recorded

396
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,899
right they're looking for explosions

397
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,980
they're looking for last you know Mass

398
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,440
casualties they're looking for for

399
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,300
pictures that will attract viewers

400
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,820
they're looking for for conflict on a

401
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,160
daily basis but War also includes a lot

402
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,380
of other things right and it's very hard

403
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,240
for mainstream media to cover all of

404
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
those things and this is where citizen

405
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,660
media come into play and this is where

406
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,060
citizen media practices are important

407
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,459
platform algorithmic Logics I'm sure is

408
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,920
something that has come up throughout

409
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,500
this year's conference and we know how

410
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,180
difficult it is to push through a

411
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,459
platform algorithmic Logics

412
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,740
um because you know they they have a lot

413
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,199
of power in into what content surfaces

414
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,600
and what content becomes visible and so

415
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,540
part of the citizen media practices

416
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,699
um and they're part of their aim is also

417
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,740
to push against those Logics and to find

418
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,399
ways to co-opt or subvert them in order

419
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,440
to put through the messages that the

420
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,540
citizens think are really important or

421
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,399
even to build alternative media on

422
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,320
alternative platforms which again is a

423
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,660
tradition that has existed you know in

424
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,699
Indie media and alternative media for

425
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,320
quite some time and we're now seeing

426
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,779
attempts for the same logic to be

427
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,699
introduced in the in the hybrid media

428
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,880
system and in the social media space

429
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,579
the biggest part about the political

430
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,260
aspects of media practices in

431
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,380
participatory Warfare is that they are

432
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,780
important because they bring the publics

433
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,179
to the fore and they the aim is to

434
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,160
Center The public's voices and not the

435
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,079
voices of the state or you know the

436
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,959
voices of NATO where the voices of the

437
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,119
UN but the Public's voices

438
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,640
and to report about the war and its

439
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,179
effects on citizens and on individuals

440
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,220
which again I think sounds like a very

441
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,520
admirable goal and part of the task that

442
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,280
citizens set for themselves right is is

443
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,620
to report on a very real effects

444
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,960
everyday effects of the war on on people

445
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,559
and to narrate histories of violence to

446
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,380
show that you know this isn't just

447
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,080
this war didn't just start in February

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
didn't start eight years ago that there

449
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,660
is a longer history of

450
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,120
of Confrontation and violence here and

451
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,679
to you know to draw connections between

452
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,480
different events that may or may not be

453
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,440
obvious

454
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,660
um to to people who are not for instance

455
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,520
Ukrainian citizens that have lived in

456
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,679
the country for quite some time

457
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,539
so hopefully I've you know I've

458
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,980
convinced you that this is a really

459
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,539
useful concept

460
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,940
um and that focusing on the individuals

461
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
and focusing on the Grassroots level is

462
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,419
really important

463
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,580
um so really I I want to just jump

464
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,020
straight into what we can observe in the

465
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,940
hybrid media space of Russia's war in

466
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,400
Ukraine and specifically what we can

467
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,620
observe in what the citizens have been

468
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,760
doing

469
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
um obviously these observations are a

470
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,840
work in progress so they're not in any

471
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
way systematic but to the best of my

472
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,840
ability

473
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,120
um you know and as a Ukrainian and

474
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,919
therefore a person who's also involved

475
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,840
in in a lot of these activities I have

476
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,340
tried to kind of

477
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,799
um systematize and categorize some of

478
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,380
some of my observations

479
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,039
um so because citizens participating in

480
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,559
in war and involved in the participatory

481
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,919
Warfare are very much mobilized citizens

482
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,140
um we know that they interact with the

483
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,820
media not just because they're audiences

484
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,620
of media messages so they're not just

485
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,360
possibly sitting there and consuming

486
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,000
messages produced by traditional media

487
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,460
organizations or governments but they

488
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,620
also produce media messages on a

489
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,080
systematic and continuous basis right so

490
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,039
in a way they kind of become quasi-media

491
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,799
professionals uh work you know who are

492
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,020
doing the work or some of the work that

493
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,640
traditionally journalists or media

494
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,799
practitioners do but a lot of this work

495
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,020
they do on a voluntary basis so they're

496
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,580
not paid for this it is not something

497
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,179
they learn to do or trained to do but

498
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,799
they do this work anyway and this is

499
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,720
where this comment about you know

500
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,080
citizens being micro media it really

501
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,700
really resonates

502
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,100
so some of the things we've seen in the

503
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,620
coverage of the war and how the war has

504
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,380
been socialized on social media is that

505
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,320
there is pervasive use of mobile

506
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
technology there is a lot of video which

507
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,880
you know is on the one hand it's very

508
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,700
useful because there is a lot of

509
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,720
evidence of what's happening and

510
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,179
testimonies but it's also means that

511
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,760
there's a lot of things to verify

512
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,600
um we've also seen that the war has

513
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,179
not just been visible in the digital

514
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,760
realm and so the media we have aren't

515
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,460
just digital they're also analog media

516
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,080
so there have been some reports that say

517
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,640
posters

518
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,640
um you know going up on on walls of

519
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,179
buildings in occupied territories

520
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,559
Spreading the News because very often in

521
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,480
occupied territories in Ukraine people

522
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,360
lose access to mobile connection

523
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,640
um you know Television Internet they

524
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,860
have no electricity so it's also really

525
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,419
important to understand that this isn't

526
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,900
just a digital media space it is a

527
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,600
hybrid media space and you know a lot of

528
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,159
the messaging and the media work that

529
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,500
strong transcends on social media

530
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,380
transcends digital media and a lot of it

531
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,000
is less visible because it either

532
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,159
happens in the darker corners or

533
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,559
encrypted Messengers or

534
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,900
um purportedly encrypted Messengers like

535
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,780
WhatsApp Library Telegram and sometimes

536
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,140
it it's analog messaging that you know

537
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,600
goes outside the digital world

538
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,059
we've also seen that some of the efforts

539
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,940
to engage in media practices are very

540
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,440
much individual

541
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,659
but other other efforts are Community

542
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,880
efforts so for instance you know we've

543
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,620
had several initiatives that have been

544
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,919
translating social media content that is

545
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,260
published in Ukrainian and Russian there

546
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,700
are concerted efforts that translate

547
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,340
this content and make it available in

548
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,179
English and you know so one example of

549
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,520
this is a a website called War

550
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,840
translated I think the the URL is

551
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,520
wordtranslated.org and it's basically an

552
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,140
effort that was started by an Estonian

553
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,179
citizen who speaks Russian who grew up

554
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,380
in Estonia

555
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,600
and then he found other willing

556
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,120
volunteers where they translate content

557
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
you know from Twitter threads Facebook

558
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,840
posts

559
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,840
um videos shared across social media

560
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,460
platforms

561
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,120
um just to make basically increase the

562
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,460
potential audience for for these

563
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,080
testimonies and these stories that are

564
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,400
shared and you know they've translated

565
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,400
things like stories by people escaping

566
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Russian occupation people going having

567
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,179
been forcefully deported to Russian

568
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,980
territory from occupied Ukrainian

569
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,600
territory and then finding their way

570
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
back to Ukraine somehow so there's all

571
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,900
sorts of stories that they're

572
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,640
translating one other thing they

573
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
translate is they also translate

574
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,659
comments under certain posts and that

575
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,760
you know sometimes I think it's it's

576
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,740
quite an eye-opener for instance to see

577
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,900
the kinds of comments that you know

578
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,679
ukrainians post under a video of a shout

579
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,480
out Russian tank or comments that

580
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,200
Russian users post under videos of you

581
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,659
know City Center in a Ukrainian town

582
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,460
that has just been attacked in civilian

583
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,020
infrastructure has been attacked the

584
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,760
Summons of some of those comments are

585
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,340
quite vicious and violent so that they

586
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,980
also see it as an important job to

587
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,720
translate this um this work

588
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,460
of course one of the things that media

589
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,260
practices do in this case because

590
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,059
they're not

591
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,679
practiced you know these things aren't

592
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,539
practiced by professional journalists

593
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,539
and therefore citizens engaging in these

594
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,200
practices are not necessarily

595
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,559
Bound by the same ethics of Journalism

596
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,440
is that they normalize emotionality in

597
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,539
media practices right because obviously

598
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,000
for Citizens affected by the war

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,700
being emotional about it is is an

600
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,500
absolutely normal thing

601
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,820
um but what we've seen in journalism

602
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,220
studies is that increasingly emotions

603
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,580
are also being normalized even for

604
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,020
professional journalists right because

605
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,760
if you're reporting on conflict or

606
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,159
you're reporting on a disaster you are a

607
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,020
person and therefore you have emotions

608
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,059
you know so that we've observe this

609
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,740
effective term we're even journalists

610
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,039
increasingly find it useful and find it

611
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,260
acceptable to talk about you know what

612
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,000
what they're feeling and not just what

613
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,559
they're seeing which is traditionally

614
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,260
seen as the task of journalists but here

615
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,539
because this is happening

616
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,580
um to Citizens and because these are

617
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,380
ordinary citizens who are doing this

618
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,600
journalistic work right

619
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,220
they rely

620
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,419
um you know they believe that their

621
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,820
emotions are important and they believe

622
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,460
that you know emotions have a mobilizing

623
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,700
power and of course emotions can be

624
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,919
negative and positive and increasingly

625
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,299
we're seeing that both negative and

626
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,799
positive emotions

627
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,919
are being promoted as acceptable right

628
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,500
so

629
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,900
essentially you know what we're doing is

630
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,840
we're seeing citizens negotiate this

631
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,360
effective proximity right which is often

632
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,779
in journalism seen as something

633
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,120
detrimental right if you're too close

634
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,320
emotionally to something you can't talk

635
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,720
about it in an objective way but here

636
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
we're seeing that emotions and being

637
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
emotional right is actually something

638
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,740
that is constructive because it allows

639
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,039
citizens to circumscribe the life

640
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,960
risking media practices right when you

641
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,700
go to film an explosion that just

642
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,000
happened and also you know makes your

643
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,279
emotional labor of a citizen other

644
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,940
citizen journalist acceptable right

645
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,700
because it negates this imagined space

646
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,740
that usually exists between a journalist

647
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,059
who's trying to be objective about

648
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,960
covering an event and and you know it

649
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,179
might still seem like oh well they're

650
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,039
too emotional about it so we can't rely

651
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,840
on on what they're saying but

652
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,120
nonetheless I think this work is half

653
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,059
happening you know in real time where

654
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,740
this effective proximity becomes more

655
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,720
acceptable and it becomes kind of seen

656
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,700
as part and parcel of covering conflict

657
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,400
and covering more

658
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,460
and the other reason why I think we know

659
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,159
why citizens are often compelled to

660
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,380
engage in these media practices and

661
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,419
report and explain what is going on in

662
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,700
the conflict is this idea of being close

663
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,740
to violence where you yourself as an

664
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,779
observer or as a participant of the

665
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,840
events are traumatized but you're also

666
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,940
compelled to report and to explain

667
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,460
because you can explain both what is

668
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,740
going on and also what it feels like so

669
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,539
this has become I think very important

670
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,720
as a conflict has has unfolded

671
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,919
um and of course

672
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,020
um a big part of Citizen media practices

673
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,419
is also because citizens feel empowered

674
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,539
to engage in these media practices

675
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:38,340
because it allows them to negotiate

676
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,100
unequal power relations right

677
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,480
um because they often feel like they

678
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,760
don't have enough power uh compared to

679
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,080
say traditional journalists or

680
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,940
government officials to make statements

681
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,159
about how the war is affecting them but

682
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,080
it also allows them to shape boundaries

683
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,559
right to say that I have a right as a

684
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,480
Ukrainian citizens to report on this and

685
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,340
to explain what's happening maybe

686
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,960
somebody else who doesn't understand the

687
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,240
local context doesn't have the right or

688
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,140
can't report in as convincing a way and

689
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,940
so I think the the effective component

690
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,440
here is very important to take into

691
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,880
account

692
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,700
so if we get into the actual citizen

693
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,340
media practices themselves there is a

694
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,679
wide range of different practices

695
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,740
and that I and my fellow social

696
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,559
scientists have observed even throughout

697
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,899
the past five months but also of course

698
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,000
my my observations are also informed by

699
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,340
the fact that I've been studying digital

700
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,679
media and protests in Ukraine and in the

701
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,179
region for for many years so of course

702
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:41,399
some of the core media practices are you

703
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,620
know the traditional sort of

704
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,899
journalistic issues like framing and

705
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,860
agenda setting where the the citizens

706
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,220
engage in creating messages and

707
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,340
spreading messages trying to explain

708
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,039
not just what is going on but also what

709
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,340
the words about why it started why it is

710
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,039
happening who is involved so to try and

711
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,039
put a um you know to give more context

712
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,779
um to everything that is happening to

713
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,600
provide deeper background

714
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,179
um the other important aspect of media

715
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,159
practices is that citizens are

716
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,620
contributing to creating a vocabulary of

717
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,299
War right there is a a certain type of

718
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,059
you know vocabulary different terms that

719
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,279
are used and those terms are often

720
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,500
contested and so citizens are engaging

721
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,419
on social media and linguistic

722
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:34,700
articulation

723
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,380
trying to explain you know why you

724
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,059
should use this word to describe what's

725
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,100
happening what you shouldn't use a

726
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,020
different word so for instance you know

727
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,600
they say don't say the Ukraine crisis

728
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,539
say Russia's war in Ukraine right and

729
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,460
and thereby in building these

730
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,919
vocabularies they're also engaging in a

731
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,720
kind of corrective communication where

732
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,919
they're saying this is how you should

733
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,360
talk about it and you should listen to

734
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,100
us because we are citizens of this

735
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,679
country directly affected by this war so

736
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,820
there's been a lot of this

737
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,200
corrective communication and this

738
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,179
vocabulary building work and I'll show

739
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,820
you a few examples in just a second

740
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,980
um of course alongside Framing and

741
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,260
agenda setting you know some people take

742
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,760
it upon themselves to also provide

743
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,039
historical and political contexts so

744
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,140
again they they put the events that are

745
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,539
happening right now into a much longer

746
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,039
history

747
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,620
um you know where they explain like the

748
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,320
legacies of Russian colonialism you know

749
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,539
of the Soviet

750
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,980
colonial policies and even the

751
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,159
pre-soviet colonial policies and you

752
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,899
know histories of conquest and violence

753
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,600
and they draw here obviously on

754
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,860
historical records but they also draw

755
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,440
very often on their family history which

756
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,520
makes

757
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,799
uh you know these these media practices

758
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,659
more compelling because they're not just

759
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,220
saying oh well in this textbook this

760
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,860
this renowned historians historian says

761
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,380
this but they're also saying you know

762
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,200
there is a history of for instance you

763
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,539
know Russia using hunger as a weapon of

764
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,500
uh politics and a weapon of of

765
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,720
colonialism and not just in Ukraine but

766
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,700
also in you know another post-soviet

767
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,559
countries and they give examples and

768
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,820
then they talk about their own family

769
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,640
history you know because obviously some

770
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,500
of this history is quite recent you know

771
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,380
it's like the last 150 years so a lot of

772
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,779
people have family stories and family

773
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,240
histories of family members uh being

774
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,500
subjected to to these um Legacies

775
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,360
um the other important work that media

776
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,200
practices do and for Citizens is that

777
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,020
they um they allow people to assign

778
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,600
blame on responsibility and again this

779
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,820
is very much a discursive

780
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,419
um

781
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,580
media practice so a lot of these things

782
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,440
are worked out in discussions on social

783
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,899
media uh where people you know make

784
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,700
different points about who exactly

785
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,380
should be blamed for the fact that this

786
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,360
war is happening right and they talk

787
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
about Collective blame and individual

788
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,500
blame but these discussions are are

789
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,120
incredibly Lively and they're happening

790
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,360
on a daily basis right

791
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,399
so it and it's very important because

792
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,559
obviously you know if we look at

793
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,940
traditional media

794
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,100
there is a certain way that media tend

795
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,440
to frame conflicts and they tend to

796
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,380
frame you know whose Army it is is it

797
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,539
Russian army or is it Putin's Army is

798
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,220
you know is the president to blame for

799
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,740
the war or are ordinary Russians to be

800
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,120
blamed for the war and again these

801
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,399
discussions are much livelier and

802
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,380
they're they're much more mobile and

803
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,779
much more transformative on on the

804
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:37,200
Grassroots level in citizen social media

805
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,480
um the next thing that um

806
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,279
I think for me is an important component

807
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,799
of media practices is

808
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,559
citizens play the role of Watchdogs

809
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,480
which again traditionally is played by

810
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,360
by mainstream journalists but here they

811
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,760
use their media practices to hold the

812
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,460
power to account right and this doesn't

813
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,659
just

814
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,700
mean that they're talking about holding

815
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,620
you know the Russian government to

816
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,320
account for for attacking Ukraine or say

817
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
holding certain Ukrainian officials to

818
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,120
account for being corrupt but they're

819
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,220
also holding other actors to account

820
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,220
they're holding platforms to account for

821
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,500
being really bad at moderating content

822
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,720
uh during the war

823
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,000
they're holding corporations to account

824
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,279
or say continuing to do business with

825
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,179
Russia for uh you know even though there

826
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,340
are massive sanctions and they're also

827
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,080
holding other citizens to account for

828
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,100
all kinds of things for you know for

829
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,600
sharing for instance videos of missile

830
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
attacks too soon because that's

831
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,580
dangerous and you know if you share a

832
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,559
video of the exact spot where a missile

833
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,019
attack happened the attack might might

834
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,440
happen again in a very short time

835
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,880
they're also holding other citizens to

836
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,380
account for

837
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,179
um you know for for doing other things

838
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,220
like doxing people or you know not not

839
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,320
sharing truthful information so there's

840
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,880
a lot of holding to account that happens

841
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,799
and I think it's really interesting to

842
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,919
see how that develops as a kind of genre

843
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,419
of media practices

844
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:13,799
of course I've already mentioned

845
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,620
witnessing and personal testimony I

846
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,059
think this is one of the most powerful

847
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,600
media practices that we've observed

848
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,120
because it relies on people's personal

849
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,000
storytelling and obviously on social

850
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,100
media we know personal stories tend to

851
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,799
travel further than a lot of other types

852
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,440
of information

853
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,659
and again what we've seen in the war is

854
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,299
we've seen stories you know Twitter

855
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,360
threads Facebook posts that are

856
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,580
sometimes spontaneous so somebody

857
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,799
decides you know they they are brave

858
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,679
enough to share their experience very

859
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,919
often it might it also becomes somewhat

860
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,960
organized when one person shares

861
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,820
something and then another person shares

862
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,500
something in a similar format and then

863
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,260
it becomes a kind of flash mob but this

864
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,640
personal storytelling is really

865
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,159
important right because it adds that

866
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,159
depth of individual experiences to

867
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,440
traditional media reporting and this is

868
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,199
where we get all of these on the ground

869
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,239
reports of displacement occupation loss

870
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,940
struggle right and so there's a range of

871
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,060
different kinds of witnessing you know

872
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,619
of people who have had to leave the

873
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,839
country be displaced or people who have

874
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,399
had to move across the country people

875
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,679
have lost their homes people who've lost

876
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,599
their family members

877
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,918
um you know soldiers on the front line

878
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,480
so there's all kinds of testimonies and

879
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,739
I think for me this is one of the

880
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,359
richest media practices that I've

881
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,540
observed of course there's also

882
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,119
things that we have become a little more

883
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,619
accustomed to such as open source

884
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,320
intelligence and Gathering evidence of

885
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,020
war crimes and human rights atrocities

886
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,560
Gathering data identifying destroyed

887
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,900
military equipment all of this stuff is

888
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,820
happening some of it is happening kind

889
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,440
of in a more professionalized way but

890
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,180
there's also a lot of Grassroots

891
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,020
activity there and then also

892
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,240
crowdsourcing which again has been I

893
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,619
think

894
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,540
quite prominent in the Ukrainian social

895
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,359
media space even before

896
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,280
the war and even before the start of the

897
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,560
war eight years ago crowdfunding has

898
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,440
become a normal part of life for

899
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,020
Ukrainian social media users

900
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,320
um yes you know in this war for instance

901
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,240
the government is negotiating with other

902
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,339
governments and other countries for

903
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,160
military assistance but citizens on the

904
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,680
ground are also crowdfunding for drones

905
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,540
for protective equipment for flak

906
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,660
jackets for you know helmets and all

907
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,780
sorts of things also for humanitarian

908
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,240
aid for displaced people so crowdfunding

909
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
has blossomed there are lots of multiple

910
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,280
platforms that people use to crowdfund

911
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,320
there's all sorts of things that people

912
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,460
do to raise money you know from United

913
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,099
States celebrities selling auctioning

914
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,280
off some sort of memorabilia like the

915
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
Eurovision winners auctioning off

916
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,079
Eurovision prize to you know people

917
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,200
using only fans to sell nudes and crowds

918
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,119
fund for the Army like that that has

919
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,560
also happened

920
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,200
um so crowdfunding I think will be one

921
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,660
of the like biggest learning experiences

922
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,820
for for the Grassroots media practices

923
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,160
and the effort here and I'm sure that

924
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,680
you know other other communities in

925
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,599
other countries will probably learn from

926
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,640
from our crowdfunding efforts and and

927
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,700
the creativity that goes into this uh of

928
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,680
course fact checking is also important

929
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,720
and it's a big part of kind of the

930
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,980
everyday

931
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,579
um

932
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,680
uh you know the everyday media practices

933
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,900
but a lot of fact checking is obviously

934
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,220
done by media organizations or by media

935
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,780
media ngos

936
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,359
um and you know we also know that fact

937
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,280
checking after the fact that some kind

938
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,680
of disinformation is spread is is only

939
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,420
part of the story it's also important to

940
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,940
pre pre-fact check you know to put the

941
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,619
facts out there before

942
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,440
um before something is is shared and of

943
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,420
course a lot of this is also Mutual

944
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,119
support and agency so people do engage

945
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,160
in media practices just to you know to

946
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,859
comfort each other and to to offer

947
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,140
um support and to offer care to each

948
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,780
other so that is also a big part

949
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,760
of what's happening in in the media

950
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,619
practice space and of course also

951
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,140
educating each other about

952
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,640
um you know how to protect your privacy

953
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,400
online how to avoid being reported by

954
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,980
Bots and and you know how to avoid

955
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,460
complaints from social media platforms

956
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,960
how to protect your data how to protect

957
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,520
your identity how to protect your

958
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,420
account all of those things are also

959
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,040
happening so it is it is a really

960
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,460
multifaceted set of media practices all

961
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,619
of them are targeted and they're all

962
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,119
happening in this participatory War

963
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,400
space but but they're all very very

964
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,440
diverse

965
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,900
so um just some of the media forms

966
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,820
obviously we have Facebook posts Twitter

967
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,160
threads Twitter live spaces YouTube

968
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,260
videos uh Twitter live spaces have

969
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,119
become really really popular outsized

970
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,339
popularity we have some regular ones now

971
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,380

972
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,599
a couple of times a week

973
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,460
um that bring people together

974
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,400
um to discuss the war

975
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,359
telegram is an incredibly popular

976
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,880
platform for sharing person-to-person

977
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,160

990
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,500
sharing testimonies recording things as

991
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,660
they happen including attacks and people

992
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,700
are engaging in both creation and

993
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,619
curation

994
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,720
so just some examples for you so this is

995
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
an example of corrective communication

996
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,000
and trying to manage the vocabulary so

997
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,460
this is this is an image that's been one

998
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,579
of many widely shared on social media

999
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,200
um you know that basically says here's

1000
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,640
how you should talk about the war in

1001
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,020
Ukraine and this is you know we're

1002
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,540
telling you this is ukrainians

1003
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,579
um so you're saying you should name the

1004
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,859
war you should name the aggressor you

1005
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,359
should be deliberate and you should

1006
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,980
avoid words that imply shared

1007
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,540
responsibility

1008
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,099
um and you know I think this this is a

1009
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,800
really good example of this vocabulary

1010
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,660
building

1011
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
um

1012
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,920
I think also this is another example of

1013
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,200
you know a person reacting in a very

1014
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,480
emotional way this is a volunteer that

1015
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,800
is very active

1016
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,380
um in helping the military

1017
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,660
this is testimony because she's sharing

1018
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,579
what she's feeling but also she's

1019
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:54,960
framing

1020
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240
she's providing a framing for those who

1021
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,940
may not be inside Ukraine to say look

1022
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,339
you should understand

1023
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,400
this this is the kind of trauma

1024
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,900
um you know that we're experiencing

1025
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,200
every day is that you should you always

1026
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,119
expect to hear sirens you'll always

1027
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,700
expect to hear the air raid alarms but

1028
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,380
in spite of everything you try you still

1029
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,300
try to live a life that is somehow close

1030
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,700
to the norm but you can't

1031
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,260
um so I think this is a very powerful

1032
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,500
example here of this kind of message

1033
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,720
a differential privacy is something I

1034
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,040
wanted to mention because I know you

1035
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
know differential privacy is a term that

1036
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,119
is widely used in in privacy studies um

1037
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,220
and it's usually it's usually used to

1038
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,619
describe platform accordances

1039
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,200
but I think here this is a good example

1040
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,480
of how people understand language on

1041
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,800
social media

1042
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,440
as a differential privacy tool right

1043
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,839
because multiple Ukrainian accounts on

1044
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,460
Twitter for instance tweet in multiple

1045
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,520
languages right um and so

1046
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,319
um you know on the left here we have a

1047
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,359
tweet in Ukrainian

1048
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,240
where you know just doctor this is just

1049
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,740
Dr uh

1050
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,800
a very large missile attack yesterday on

1051
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,079
on Central Ukrainian City Which is far

1052
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,640
away from the front line where multiple

1053
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,980
people were killed and Johnsons were

1054
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,040
injured this person is saying post news

1055
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,660
she's renting in Ukrainian which is

1056
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,599
saying post news with this hashtag write

1057
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,819
Tweets in English or Ukrainian but

1058
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:23,040
better in English show photos tag

1059
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,260
politicians thought leaders media storm

1060
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,079
the world so she's explicitly saying

1061
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,940
even if you're an account who usually

1062
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,520
Tweets in Ukrainian because that's your

1063
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,359
sort of usual ammo if you want to reach

1064
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,160
bigger audiences you should tweet in

1065
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,380
English and on the left here is another

1066
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,359
Ukrainian activist

1067
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,099
um who's saying you know he's responding

1068
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,839
to a commenter who's telling him I can

1069
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,099
tell when you're really passionate or

1070
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,420
angry when you start tweeting in

1071
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,760
Ukrainian because this person lives in a

1072
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,680
western European country and he usually

1073
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,780
Tweets in English but he tweeted

1074
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,579
something in Ukrainian and then he

1075
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,380
responds and says it tends to be for the

1076
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,000
Ukrainian audience with references to

1077
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,680
memes and events that are too long to

1078
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,079
explain in English right so we can see

1079
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,000
this differential privacy in action

1080
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
through the use of multiple languages

1081
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,660
even without relying on algorithmic you

1082
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,300
know algorithmic Logics or curation but

1083
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,880
this is also evidence that Ukrainian

1084
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,640
citizens understand very well how

1085
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,099
privacy works and how you know context

1086
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,380
collapse works and how algorithms work

1087
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,640
when it comes to tweeting in different

1088
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,280
languages

1089
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,540
so in conclusion

1090
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,099
um I think

1091
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,079
I hopefully have convinced you that

1092
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,119
understanding these micro media

1093
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,520
practices is important because in a

1094
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,220
complex environment where the realities

1095
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,920
of participatory War mixed with platform

1096
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,400
algorithms State disinformation

1097
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,980
mainstream media Logics we need to

1098
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,599
understand that these micro media

1099
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,520
citizen practices are an integral part

1100
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,339
of how people participate in word today

1101
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,619
and they're also inherently political

1102
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,079
they're purposely effective they don't

1103
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,420
shy away from being emotional and they

1104
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,579
can also act as drivers of democracy

1105
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,040
resistance and resilience for Citizens

1106
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,160
and communities impacted by War and I

1107
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,500
think it's important to account for all

1108
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,839
of these diverse media practices because

1109
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,760
we really want to understand the

1110
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,400
motivations Logics and principles Behind

1111
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,280
These practices at the micro level right

1112
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,380
not just the macro picture not just the

1113
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,319
geopolitics but how ordinary citizens

1114
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,040
lives are affected and how they you know

1115
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,619
how they're affected Finds Its way into

1116
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,260
how they engage in media practices on

1117
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,720
social media and outside of them because

1118
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,839
this is integral to understand how the

1119
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,420
hybrid media system is changing how the

1120
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,700
political

1121
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,819
environment changes during Wars and also

1122
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,619
the nature of participatory Warfare

1123
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:54,540
which we understand to be an assemblage

1124
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,119
of media practices political relations

1125
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,400
and power relations and I think really

1126
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,560
my goal here is to foreground and

1127
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,240
highlight the really really important

1128
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,099
role of citizens

1129
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,640
um you know as as drivers of democracy

1130
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,940
and as potentially also important actors

1131
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,720
who might allow us to you know bring

1132
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,640
those responsible for war crimes to

1133
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,579
justice but also basically to to provide

1134
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,460
a more than truthful account on a very

1135
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,260
accurate account albeit an emotional

1136
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,680
account of what the war is like you know

1137
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,000
because that that is very often

1138
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,319
something that

1139
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,400
uh people far away from

1140
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,560
a place where war is happening might not

1141
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,119
always be able to grasp and I think

1142
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,800
these citizen actions are really really

1143
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,359
important

1144
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:46,819
with that I will stop sharing

1145
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,300
and I've he'll be happy to take any

1146
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,540
questions okay

1147
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,200
so we have time for some questions
