1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,040
hello hello

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,400
yes no

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
yeah okay great

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
excellent so

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,960
uh

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,680
we are at the stage uh where we

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
introduce our best paper awards um and

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
it's uh my pleasure to do that but uh

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,480
before we do that

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,320
um i just like to say that i hope

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
everybody has enjoyed the symposium just

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
as much as i did and not just the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
excellent presentations and the papers

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
but also the questions the discussions

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,320
the dinners and the cultural experiences

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
that that we had in sydney here

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
my cultural experience of the week was

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
uh was in the middle of the afternoon

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
where we discovered that actually

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,719
um

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,039
privacy-enhancing technologies have

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
existed on this continent for about 200

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
million years

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,120
and if you're wondering what the hell

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,920
this is you can ask rachel if uh if

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,280
she's around

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
but my takeaway from that is that the

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,840
nym node that i'm going to set up over

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
the weekend is going to be called

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,680
pleasey the plesiosaur um and uh in in

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
in uh memory of the cultural experience

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
that i had here in sydney so uh so there

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,799
we go

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
um speaking of nym nodes uh i am here on

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,360
behalf of nim uh the uh the sponsor um

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,119
and uh if you've missed my rum session

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,159
talk then there is a little room in

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,799
gather town where you can go and read

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,200
our white papers and and have a bit of a

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
look um and and get involved um and

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,799
indeed some people have been talking to

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
me about this which is which is great um

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
and if you've got some kind of a

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
protocol or some kind of an application

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,680
that is in need of network level privacy

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,759
then we will be very happy to assist you

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
and you don't even have to be one of the

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
best paper award winners that offer is

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,880
available to everybody um but i'm

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,399
rambling on and uh before we go to the

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
actual best paper awards um there's

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,640

good morning wherever you are i'm dave

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,280
morenzo i'm the ceo

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,920
of haven tech and i just want to give a

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
quick thanks

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
and congratulations to you all ahead of

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
handing over to the awards

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
it was once said that if you can define

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
a problem correctly

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,680
you almost have a solution and at haven

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
tech we believe the problem like we

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,239
understand you believe

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
is the current technologies are

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,800
providing inadequate protection

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
to sensitive information

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,000
and privacy

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,879
so

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
do we almost have

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
a solution

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
consumer education enhanced enterprise

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
procedures

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,920
greater regulation they've slowed down

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
the impact on privacy

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,599
but like yourself we believe the answer

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,640
lies

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,920
in privacy enhancing technologies

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
they must underpin the advancements

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
required to protect our right to privacy

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,480
in the years to come

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
and as such the importance

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
of initiatives

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
like pets

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
cannot be underestimated

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,480
at avontech we believe addressing the

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
weaknesses of the current digital trust

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,760
model

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
will require a change of approach

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
from centralization to decentralization

94
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,959
from enterprise centric

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,879
to consumer-centric

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,120
changing the way applications interact

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,319
with data

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,040
changing the way individuals enterprises

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,560
and third parties

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
access that data

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,640
and providing ultimately

102
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,519
individuals with more control

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
over how their personal information

104
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
is used and shared

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
so on behalf of the entire team at haven

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
tech

107
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,319
congratulations to all of the nominees

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
this year

109
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,360
and thank you

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
and i mean that wholeheartedly we know

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
that consumers

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
enterprises and regulators are all

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
seeking solutions

114
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,320
to the current

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,479
and the inherent weaknesses and

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,400
complexities of the current digital

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
trust model

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
and importantly

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
for those who have an entrepreneurial

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
spirit amongst you

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,680
there is money pouring into the sector

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
right now and if you don't believe me

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
pick up morningstar's report from last

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
month and you'll have a look at the

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
valuations that privacy enhancing

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
technology businesses are getting at the

127
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,719
moment

128
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
enterprises urgency surrounding quantum

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
computing development by hostile actors

130
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
coupled with the increased use of

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
immutable data sets and web 3

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,080
initiatives by enterprises means that

133
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
your research has never

134
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
been more important

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
it's now my pleasure to introduce or

136
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,919
hand over not introduce actually you

137
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,039

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,360

not the program chess the orchestra

143
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,719
fair enough

144
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,610
[Music]

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
spoiler alert

146

so much for having slides all right so

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
we're going to kick off with

153
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
the andreas fitzman best student paper

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
award

155
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
so this year jeremiah and myself had the

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,319
honor of chairing this award and um

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
it was not an easy job so i think we can

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
see it as much there were many great

159
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
papers many great talks

160
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
so just to tell you a little bit about

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,280
how the whole process worked

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,160
we

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,759
there are selection criteria you can

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,479
read already read them on the pets

165
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,759
website so these include the reviews

166
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
that were written by the program

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
committee the significance of the

168
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,759
scientific quality of the work the

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,840
expected impact

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,639
of

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,080
the paper on

172
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
the field and also

173
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
the quality of the presentation

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,160
so we

175
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
were given a short list by the program

176
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,440
chairs so florian and michelle and our

177
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
job was to then further narrow down that

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,039
list

179
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
again going over the reviews the scores

180
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,720
um

181
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
read the papers and then

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
our final task was to then attend the

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
presentations so this is what we did

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
over the past few days and

185
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,319
we then made our final decision after

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
attending the presentations

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
with

188
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
that having said we're going to now move

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,919
on to actually handing out the awards so

190
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,120
we have um selected three runners-ups

191
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
like i said the job was not easy so we

192
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160
have three runners-up and uh one winner

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
so we're going to start with the

194
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
runners-up

195
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
oh okay

196
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,950
whoops

197
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,000
[Laughter]

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
um so the first runner-up is atom a

199
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
generalizable technique for inferring

200
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
tracker advertiser data sharing in the

201
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
online behavioral advertising ecosystem

202
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
and the authors are mas bin musa and

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,440
rishab nithyanan both from

204
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
the university of iowa and jeremiah is

205
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,800
now going to say a few words about the

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,759
paper

207
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,560
yeah

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
so

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,039
i guess

210
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,440
in the online advertising ecosystem

211
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
there's oftentimes data sharing between

212
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
trackers

213
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
and advertisers

214
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,680
oftentimes the extent of the sharing is

215
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,280
a black box and so the authors gave a

216
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
generalizable

217
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,280
tool to kind of audit and detect data

218
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,639
sharing

219
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
and by selectively blocking trackers and

220
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
then observing the

221
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,159
changes that

222
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
that creates they were able to actually

223
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,320
identify and infer some previously

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
undisclosed data sharing

225
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
instances

226
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,640
so yeah can we have uh

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
any of the authors in the

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,760
could you please come to the stage

229
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
congratulations

230
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:11,019
[Applause]

231
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
okay

232
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,880
um by the way these run is up are in no

233
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,279
particular order so um we're just going

234
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,680
through um one by one throw them one by

235
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,399
one

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
um so the next one um is the paper title

237
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
leveraging strategic connection

238
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,600
migration power traffic splitting for

239
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,399
privacy and here the authors are mona

240
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,600
wang uh

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,320
anunnai kosta

242
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
all authors are from princeton

243
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,320
university so um

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
i don't think anyone from the author

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
list is in the room because this was a

246
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
talk that was given remotely

247
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
me

248
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
are they on together

249
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
so if you are in gather town could you

250
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,120
maybe come up to

251
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,839
the questions rug or the speaker

252
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,839
podium

253
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,399
no

254
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
it's too late maybe probably yeah but

255
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
we'll make sure that um

256
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,040
they get their certificate we can still

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,000
say a few words but yeah yeah so um this

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,480
paper uh i guess exploits the

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
observation that

260
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
many encrypted protocol connections are

261
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
no longer specifically tied to an ip

262
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
address and so

263
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
it really um kind of exploits the

264
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,600
connection migration

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,640
feature

266
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,920
to

267
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
basically hide traffic from a

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,959
an attacker and essentially mitigate

269
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,518
the risk of

270
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,360
a

271
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,519
an adversary that's sniffing traffic and

272
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
uh limit the uh you know privacy uh

273
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,040
violations that that uh attacker can

274
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
can make

275
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
all right so once again congratulations

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,279
to the authors

277
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
and probably the next slide is new to

278
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
you because

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
you've already seen the first couple

280
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,440
all right third and last runner-up is on

281
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
defeating graph analysis of anonymous

282
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,240
transactions so here the authors are

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
christophe egger

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,519
russell ly

285
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
victoria rong

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
all from the friedrich alexander

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
university at erlangen nerdberg and we

288
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
have iview independently affiliated and

289
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
hoover yin from the chinese university

290
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
of hong kong

291
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
um and jeremiah will talk about the

292
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
paper okay yeah so

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
the paper looks at

294
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
ring signatures and the goal of a ring

295
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
signature is to hide the identity

296
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,399
identity of a signer in a larger group

297
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,839
or a ring

298
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,880
and

299
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,959
there's many messages that are signed

300
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
then you get a transaction graph

301
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
and sometimes attackers can use this

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,839
transaction graph to try to de-anonymize

303
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
or identify people

304
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,120
so

305
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
this paper is really seeking to leverage

306
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,079
fundamental connections from

307
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,639
combinatorial graph theory to

308
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
look at questions like how big should

309
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,839
the ring be

310
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,480
to effectively uh preserve anonymity

311
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,639
all right do we have any of the authors

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,959
in the room

313
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
all right okay if not let's uh

314
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
maybe

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,160
give them a round of applause

316
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,279
and now on to the winner in the last

317
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,720
award for

318
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
the this category

319
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,199
so

320
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
like i said we have selected one winner

321
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,240
for the best um student paper award and

322
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,160
um jeremiah will also tell a little bit

323
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
about why this was our winner but first

324
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,920
i'm going to introduce our winner so

325
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
this is cover drop blowing the whistle

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
through a news app

327
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,279
authors are mansour ahmed rangers diana

328
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
vasile danielle hogan roth alistair

329
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
varys ford and ross anderson all authors

330
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,839
from university of cambridge

331
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,680
congratulations congratulations

332
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
congratulations yeah so we were both uh

333
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
very impressed by this work um i think

334
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,800
the authors put a tremendous amount of

335
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
effort into actually hosting workshops

336
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,760
talking to journalists

337
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
identifying what the important criteria

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
would be

339
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
and in terms of real world impact i

340
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
think they've done a phenomenal job in

341
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,399
actually trying to collaborate with news

342
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,320
agencies along the way and

343
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
that increases the potential for uh

344
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,839
well yeah for significant real world

345
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,959
impact

346
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,250
so

347
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:33,909
[Applause]

350
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
portion for the bastard and paper award

351
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,399
i'm going to hand off to the artifacts

352
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,399
people

353
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
okay turns out i don't have slides

354
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,760
because no one invited me to make any

355
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,920
[Laughter]

356
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,440
i think we'll have to attribute that to

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
being i'm announcing our newest award

358
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
here at pets so last year we announced

359
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
we were going to introduce an artifact

360
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
award to recognize all the hard work

361
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,920
that people have been putting into

362
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,880
making

363
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
strong accessible and reproducible

364
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
artifacts

365
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,959
so

366
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,360
one year ago today this was announced

367
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
and now we finally get to award the

368
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,399
first one

369
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,120
the process was that for every artifact

370
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,440
that was submitted for an accepted paper

371
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,800
at pets the reviewers each gave it a

372
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,240
ranking of

373
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
kind of how award-worthy or incredibly

374
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,560
awesome they found it to review

375
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,440
and that created a shortlist that then

376
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,160
cecilia my co-chair and i each took a

377
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
look through and generated our own

378
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,959
initial short lists for those who don't

379
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
know the artifacts

380
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
are reviewed after the camera ready and

381
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,000
so

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,759
issue four

383
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
finished reviewing one week before pets

384
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
and just in time for us to consider them

385
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
as well so everyone did get

386
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
consideration for the artifact award we

387
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
focused on accessibility reproducibility

388
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,279
and in particular whether or not it

389
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
worked from the start so if you put in a

390
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
lot of effort at getting your artifact

391
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
ready the first time

392
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
and the reviewers didn't find anything

393
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
congratulations

394
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,199
you are a

395
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,519
not negligible but small minority

396
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
of the submissions

397
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
um

398
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
i can't show you the the title so i'm

399
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
going to read it off for you our our

400
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
winner this year

401
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,599
provided two ways to execute their code

402
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
they included both a vm that will

403
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,839
successfully help us have future

404
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,559
reproducibility as well as just how to

405
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,480
install it from the beginning that

406
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
actually worked both of these things

407
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
worked the very first time for our

408
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,280
reviewers

409
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839

researchers who have made an outstanding

469
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
contribution to the theory design

470
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,559
implementation

471
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,640
or deployment of privacy and constant

472
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
technology

473
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,120
casper was a dedicated privacy advocate

474
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
who was fighting for the right of

475
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,280
privacy and freedom for mass

476
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,559
surveillance

477
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
he believed deeply in privacy enhancing

478
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
technologies as a means to protect these

479
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
rights and was involved in the pets

480
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
community for most of

481
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,760
its history he served in the pets

482
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,000
advisory board and he was instrumental

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
in both creating the pet award and

484
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
securing its initial funding

485
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,679
uh this effort uh was uh thanks to

486
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,240
the people you see here in these photos

487
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,400
so mario ross reiner serge simon japan

488

nick

489
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,200
who

490
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
meticulously reviewed the

491
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
nominations

492
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,720
this was a result of an open call there

493
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
were 27 nominations

494
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,159
there was one duplicate

495
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,640
and one desk reject and there was a

496
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
three round review process

497
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,360
that resulted in one winner and one

498
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,918
runner-up

499
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
a few more words on the review process

500
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
everyone reviewed multiple papers there

501
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
were 5 to 12 assignments taking into

502
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,720
account the

503
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
conflicts of interest in the first round

504
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,480
25 nominations were considered in the

505
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,200
round two nine nominations went forward

506
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
based on the initial assessment and in

507
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,799
the end six top-ranked nominations stood

508
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,760
apart

509
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
and they were reviewed by the entire

510
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
jury meaning those who have no conflict

511
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,240
of interest with any of the six top

512
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
ranked nominations

513
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,120
and 10 out of 11 voted ranking the six

514
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
finalists and in the end the winner and

515
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
the runner-up were determined with the

516
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,840
help of the single transferable vote

517
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
protocol for counting the votes

518
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200
now this

daniel roland uh jennifer and pratik and

524
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,799
this is a paper that was published in

and

528
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,200
the winner

529
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
was

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,120
he uh anchored the people making with

der henderick and liane yao

535
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,600
which

536
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
will be

537
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
absorbed

538
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,520
which will be

539
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,080
presented by

540
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,799
and then we will have some words by

541
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,559
hernando so

542
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,159
katusha maybe you want to say a few

543
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,559
words now and then we pass it over to

544
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,080
to reza nando um

545
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,360
i um

546
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
i had to prepare the bit of a

547
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,440
presentation about the two papers so

548
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,159
the

549
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,120
the paper

550
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,600
can you hear me

551
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
maybe you can you can say a few things

552
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,000
about wrap paper i think um

553
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,039
if you can come back to the runner-up

554
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,559
paper for a second please slide

555
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
yeah the runner-up paper is has explored

556
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,880
the design space of multi-event vantage

557
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,679
point to domain validation and assured

558
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
that the feasibility of balancing

559
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
multiple objectives such as security

560
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
performance and benign failures

561
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
it also revised the notion of network

562
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,039
diversity so to allow for vantage points

563
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,880
to be located in different data centers

564
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
of the same cloud provider

565
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,320
while still offering a sufficient path

566
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
diversity so to detect attacks

567
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,559
and this effort culminated in an open

568
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
source implementation that is currently

569
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
deployed by

570
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,480
let's encrypt which is the the the

571
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,440
world's

572
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,000
largest certificate authority

573
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:07,939
[Applause]

574
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,520
uh yes uh so

575
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
if panos you kindly stay on the winners

576
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,679
you know just keep your keep your slides

577
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,400
just just go to the uh to the winners

578
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,960
yeah thank you so much uh so uh first of

579
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,840
all congratulations to uh to the to the

580
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,679
winners of this very important paper uh

581
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
very few words i wanted to say is that

582
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,159
when we study the cost of privacy

583
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,000
preserving algorithms

584
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,480
notably for differentially private

585
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
algorithms we look at the

586
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,360
overall utility loss of those algorithms

587
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,679
on the whole population

588
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,080
somehow we measure the expected error of

589
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,120
the algorithm over all the population

590
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
however when the

591
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
these differentially private algorithms

592
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,159
are used for making decisions on

593
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,320
individuals that belong to different

594
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,279
subgroups in the population the error of

595
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,679
those algorithms might not be uniform

596
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,600
and in many cases it's not that has been

597
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
shown multiple times at this paper what

598
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,200
it does

599
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
is that it

600
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
provides a very useful theoretical

601
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,120
framework to

602
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,039
better explain this problem that

603
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,760
differentially private algorithms might

604
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,440
result in unfair decisions

605
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
across different subgroups of the

606
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
population

607
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,760
and gives us a very concrete tool to

608
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
reason about the roots of this issue

609
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,240
this is a very very important problem

610
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,760
and the paper makes a very significant

611
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
contribution towards

612
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
helping us understand the issues

613
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,600
in

614
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,240
in these kind of processes and also it

615
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,320
suggests a few uh mitigation techniques

616
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,559
moreover basically the paper also shows

617
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,320
in a very concrete setting of releasing

618
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,640
census data using differentially private

619
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,120
algorithms how this

620
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
unfinished

621
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,399
is measured and and what the what the

622
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,159
issues are

623
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,640
so the the paper received a tremendous

624
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
support from

625
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,039
the committee and uh

626
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,880
congratulations again

627
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
now it passed to

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,960
to have our work recognizing this way by

642
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
paths especially for a project that

643
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
means so much to us

644
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
and i also want to thank the award

645

646
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,480
of the award committees so this

647
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
accomplishment is a fruit of a close and

648
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
long-standing collaboration and uh

649
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,080
numerous discussions between my students

650
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,600
uh contron

651
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,240
long-term collaborator pascal van entry

652
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,600
and zayan yao who was visiting my lab

653
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,080
during the summer of 2020.

654
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
we are also happy to see that the

655
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,679
analysis that we propose in this work

656
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,919
has inspired a line of follow-up works

657
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,600
in the field of privacy preserving

658
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,320
machine learning to try to understand

659
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,159
why private

660
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,320
machine learning algorithms might induce

661
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,279
or exacerbate desperate impacts

662
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,520
and we are continuing our efforts in

663
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,840
this area currently working with policy

664
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,279
makers in the u.s to better study such

665
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,360
talk about techs and practice

666
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,279
and i'm very excited to see how this

667
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,520
direction evolves and look forward to

668
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,679
the efforts that our community will make

669
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
to build better tools to address those

670
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,720
important fairness issues in privacy for

671
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
preserving decision making and learning

672
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
tasks

673
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
thank you again

of how we've uh we've been tracking um i

764
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,040
think earlier uh in the week i've

765

presented you maybe

766
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,119
some sort of rough statistics about what

767
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,599
we got in on that tuesday morning but

768
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,119
these are the final numbers and the

769
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,560
refined numbers

770
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,679
overall a 329 registered participants

771
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
and they're broken down as

772
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,440
you know about

773
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,679
180 150 participations online in person

774
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,679
you could see the breakdown in terms of

775
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,918
countries participations there again

776
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,599
we're actually spread across six

777
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,480
continents which is which is really good

778
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,359
um

779
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,800
and there's a little bit of you know

780
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,399
visual about how

781
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,160
we tracked in terms of online and in

782
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,560
person

783
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,320
all right some more statistics um

784
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
the arrangement teams they did receive a

785
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,760
thousand seven nine emails uh about this

786
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,359
conference

787
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,680
um gather town um about 94 morning

788
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,440
sessions and uh as in peak attendees

789
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,480
in the morning sessions 94 uh virtual

790
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,920
participants

791
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
and 67

792
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,800
uh as you know rough indication of peak

793
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,960
on on the afternoon sessions

794
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
so you may actually

795
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,839
find that interesting because the

796
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,240
morning sessions are probably more

797
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,560
convenient to the us people and the

798
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
canadian canadian

799
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,160
folks out there

800
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,359
while the

801
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,440
while the afternoon sessions are more

802
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,280
convenient to the european people but

803
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,880
bear in mind that that's obviously kind

804
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
of biased

805
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,920
with the number of participants and

806
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
registrations of course

807
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,280
um we've got about about 200 rewatches

808
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
so far on the catch-up areas on the

809
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
other town

810
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,480
we have about 20 easter eggs on the

811
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
other town

812
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,240
we have nine unique gather rooms

813
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,040
and about 12 million pixels

814
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
on that little uh platform

815
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,200
so far we do have 121 recordings that we

816
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,040
collected

817
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
that number didn't change ben did it

818
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,320
okay

819
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
out of 127 so we're still missing

820
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,200
actually six of them that we should have

821
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
uh so hopefully we will be able to get

822
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,440
that number a little bit higher

823
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,119
