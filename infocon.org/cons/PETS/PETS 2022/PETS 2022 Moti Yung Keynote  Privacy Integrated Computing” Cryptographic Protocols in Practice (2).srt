1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
right

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,480
so

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,359
uh we are ready for the keynote

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,879
i probably should move more closer to

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,320
the mic that everybody can hear me so

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
we're ready for the keynote

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it is my really really really great

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,719
pleasure to introduce more to young

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,279
i think everyone who is in the security

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,960
community knows moti

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,199
in one way or the other

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,080
uh i have i have he provided me a bio

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
and it's it's very modest for for all of

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
the things he did he's currently working

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
in the security and privacy

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
team at google

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,000
um

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,440
he got his phd from columbia university

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,920
then started his career i think at ibm

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,520
moved for a company a number of

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
companies i think i first came across

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,000
him when he was working for rsa

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
and then went to google went briefly to

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
snap went back to google

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,239
um

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,000
he received very many awards uh the ieee

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
computer society 2021 computer pioneer

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
award the 28 w

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
wallace mcdowell award and this is very

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
important in 2014 he received the acm

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
zigzag outstanding innovation award and

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,680
if you have been at that uh event it uh

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
he presented actually that he

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,439
established uh the first uh business use

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,680
of private set intersection

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
and multi-party computation at google

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,200
back then

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
and this is a real milestone

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,520
for all cryptographers that these

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,600
technologies are actually being used in

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,880
practice

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
and i know that moti has a whole bunch

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
of surprises for us today i'm sure and

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
i'm sure that there will be another set

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
of uh very interesting technologies that

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
modi uh uh brought about and i'm really

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
glad he shares those with us

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
um he also received the historics

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
outstanding research award

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
and gave in 2010 and i see is our

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,600
distinguished lecture he's a fellow of

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,119
acm ieee icreatcs

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,240
and an interesting tidbit of of his bio

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
is that

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,239
he has more co-authors than uh days in a

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,280
year

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
so uh

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
uh he probably has more co-authors than

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
people have registered here

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
for the pets conference

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
so this gives you a an idea of how long

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
moti is in in this game and we're really

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
glad to have him so uh with further

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
further i do uh moti please uh

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,519
uh start you can start your keynote

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
thank you very much

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,569
[Applause]

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,239
we see the first page still

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,120
unfortunately

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,840
um no we can't see anything currently

71
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
so same same steps as before the bottom

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
left corner there's a little screen icon

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
click that probably share your display

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,640
instead of just the powerpoint

75
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
we can see the pss research it is

76
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,840
changing

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
okay great

78
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,930
first time i use this system and

79
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,280
[Music]

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
it's fun

81
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
so i will talk today about privacy

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,799
integrated computing cryptographic

83
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,600
protocols in practice this is joint work

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,798
with people in google places

85
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,400
privacy security and safety research

86
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
and google research teams and other

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,639
people sometimes

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
but mainly people

89
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
in the industry

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
uh

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,680
bss is a newly reorganized research

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,400
group dealing with privacy security

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,120
abuse in google to support the

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,520
pss group

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
which is the

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
essentially the security engineering

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,199
teams in the company

98
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,759
so the agenda

99
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,400
i will start by characterizing the

100
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
typical computing

101
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,360
situation nowadays

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,000
i would then demonstrate such computing

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,039
nowadays

104
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,639
privacy enhancing technologies

105
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,039
uh this will be concrete industrial

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,400
projects that are

107
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,120
moving like

108
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
what i think made this project

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
successful and how following some

110
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
principles

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
like mentioning can help

112
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
the industry and also help technology

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
transfer in general

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
my goal is not to

115
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
show you my

116
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,510
more recent and fresh

117
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,720
[Music]

118
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
research and

119
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
show a lot of muscles of photographic

120
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,280
technologies

121
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
but

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
rather to

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
draw conclusions of what works

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
in

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,440
practice

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
and this project and

127
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
other projects by other people

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
i think we will set the direction of

129
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
privacy in the

130
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
coming future

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
drawing

132
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
based on

133
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
technologies and

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
based on

135
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
some technologies

136
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
even though

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
these technologies are represented in

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
the past but the

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,440
perspective of our

140
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
post

141
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
deployment and successful deployment and

142
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
extensions will be very important i

143
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
think to this community

144
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,080
after all we are talking about

145
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,520
a success of

146
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,400
basic uh

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
research agenda that is the

148
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
core of this conference

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,198
so computing in the last

150
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,400
[Music]

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
uh

152
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
he

153
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
viewed

154
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,719
as an extension of human activities

155
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
which is a very important

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
interactive tool for

157
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,599
for

158
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,000
computing

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
but he characterized computing

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,520
the goal of computing boosting mankind's

161
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
capability

162
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
for coping with complex inheritance

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
problems

164
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,479
and

165
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
later on said

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,039
augmenting society is correctly iq

167
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
so helping you

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
coping with emerging complex issues is a

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,919
big part of the

170
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
relations of

171
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,360
computer science

172
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
have to do

173
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
and this is it's uh outer facing

174
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,560
challenges when facing users and facing

175
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
fields

176
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,399
facing other areas of

177
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,360

181
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,760
how computing and humans are getting

182
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,240
closer and closer

183
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,640
in the 80s there was the pc revolution

184
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,120
so suddenly people got

185
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
a desktop

186
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,920
and they could use it

187
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,080
in their office or their home office

188
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,360
and

189
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
we saw many of the

190
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
functions that used to be on the office

191

desk moving into the pc

192
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,320
like printers

193
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,240
and uh then came the internet suddenly

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
there is global reach people with their

195

news their mail social interactions

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,959

197
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
buying

202
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
and then we

203
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
saw the mobile computing

204
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519

205
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360

[Music]

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,959
and now

210
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,160
you control everything with

211
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
computing

212
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,360
so you

213
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
has become

214
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,560
a human reality and and serves human

215
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,040
very well so

216
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
vision

217
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
is really

218
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,839

computers

220
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,040
so

221
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,480
so computing is about people

222
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
with people

223
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,440
but i quote

224
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,680
here

225
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
is known for such things

226
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
and what do i mean by this

227
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
where is the

228
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
situation

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,680
as individuals are served

230
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,160
their data is necessarily being used

231
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,279
so

232
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
now

233
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
there is an exposure

234
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,519
and this immediately uh

235
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,079
assures that

236
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
privacy is part of what computing needs

237
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,279
because

238
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,639
as you share your data you don't mean to

239
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,279
share it with everyone you don't mean

240
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
that

241
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,160
privacy

242
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,560
needs to be violated

243
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
so as we as

244
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
humans get together

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,639
all right so

at some point privately integrated

theses

261
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
perhaps is privacy by design

262
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
privacy is something

263
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
that should be maybe part of the even

264
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
the specifications

265
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,199
and the data has to be characterized

266
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,959
so it's not necessarily

so

271
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,720
as i say think about privacy from the

272
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
start

273
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,800
and it's actually easier than

274
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,680
retrofitting privacy

275
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
based on data and you design

276
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639

and principles and partially

279
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,160
implementing the specification

280
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
it's much better to retain private and

281
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,600
extreme privacy than if you build it

282
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
without privacy and then you have to

283
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,839
take care of privacy same same

284
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,320
principle that is well recognized in

285

286
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
obviously law policy etcetera are

287
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
important

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,320
any modern computer scientist who works

289
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,920
in practice has to interact with

290
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
the

291
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
these fields

292
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,160
and similar in similar fields because of

293

the again

294
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
this is because

becoming

296
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,440
are overlapping and probably becoming

not get

we may need to iterate we may need to

303
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
trade it against utility

304

computing

306
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720

[Music]

320
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,640
it is considered sometimes liability to

keep too much information

data sharing is reasonable because the

325

user wants some tasks

but

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
taking data about the users from

anywhere it is on the internet

330
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
it's not something

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,799
that the user expects and it's

something that

it's not uh warranted

when we need only limited information

342

on an individual there is no need to

343

carry all their

we have

to the company because i didn't want us

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,480
to solve a problem

424
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,640
i wanted to change my mind that

privacy

426
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880

necessarily

and

433
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,240
you need to have a group of experts

434
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,279
working in this area

435
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,600
i chose to concentrate on various

436
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
cases of

437
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,640
sharing data from different companies

438
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,480
sharing user data from different

439
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,640
companies where

440
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
privacy concerns are

441
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,360
applying privacy and sharing

442
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,120
restrictions are

443
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,520
more seriously

444
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,158
and it's very important

445
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,360
in a way that is different

446
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
then by a cryptographic protocol

447
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
something will suffer you will have

448
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,480
you will have uh points of potential

449
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
points of failure or potential points of

450
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,840
leakage

451
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
whereas

452
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
we get

453
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,799
kind of endless security

454
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
in the sense that as

455
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,679
long as the party

456
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,960
holds

457
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,400
its cryptographic is secure

458
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
then

459
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,039
it doesn't matter if it travels

460
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,919
through

461
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
other

462
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,799
parties

463
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,400
once you believe that the

464
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,840
key chosen by this party is

465
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,080
which determines

466
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,039
wider network protocol

467
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,240
with a

468
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,000
long

469
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,559
long communication so communication

470
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,200
minimalization becomes

471
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,720
first concern

472
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
and then

473
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,240
you don't want

474
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,480
two demanding competitions either

475
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,880
because

476
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
first of all

477
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
it will cause too much delays and you

478
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,799
may want to adapt it to other scenarios

479
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
and things like that

480
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,360
and this gave

481
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,520
the private intersection

482
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,559
you probably saw it in the past

see it again and get some perspective

and see what was done

487
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000

a general enough solution

491
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,840
you cannot have a specific solution for

492
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,320
anything you have to have a general

493

solution that you can easily adapt for

other things

495
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,440

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,340
we can do

536
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,360
[Music]

537
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
privacy preserving

538
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,240
private sector intersections

539
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,479
[Music]

540
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,879
and then g takes its set

541
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,720
the

542
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
this

543
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,120
simply encrypted the list that was sent

544
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,919
in one and doubly encrypted with its

545
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,919
only crypto f to get f g of g one and so

546
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,880
on send it back to g

547
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,080
in random order

548
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,520
and then it takes its own

549
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,000
set of users

550
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,919
and then

551
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,480
find how many how many elements are in

552
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,840
the interaction the intersection

553
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,080
so this gives the set size

554
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,360
and this is due to the random

555
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,320
if the initialist is sent to g in the

556
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,320
original

557
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,960
encrypted list

558
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,120
in the map

559
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,159
those locations the original element so

560
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,279
if f g

561
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,720
of g one then knows that the first

562
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,440
element is in the list

563
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,980
so

564
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,600
[Music]

565
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,840
this is

566
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,279
easy to explain

567
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,840
and to get a complete solution for what

568
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,640
we need this intersection

569
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
we need a combination of communicative

570
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
function based psi

571
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,039
with something simple protocol

572
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
and

573
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,720
it gave us a

574
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,440
very communication efficient

575
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,159
scalable

576
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,120
parameters is important

577
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,880
the protocol is again between g and m

578
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,120
we

579
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,039
[Music]

580

581
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
in which

582
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,880
the first part is running the

583
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,799

m

585
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
now g

586
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,840
g

587
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
is list of users who watch certain

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,519
content

589
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,720
and the

590
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,360
m has a list of users who spend money

591
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,840
and one span is s1

592
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,960
so google send is

593
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,919
list of user encrypted

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,279
mw encrypted permute

595
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,519
this is so

596
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,799
gfg of human

597
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
and at the is

598
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
g

599
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,719
encrypt doubly encrypt these elements

600
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,440
from the m list

601
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,280
find the intersection

605
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,839
and then

606
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,359
it can picks

607
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,239
all the

608
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,040
second component of those elements that

609
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,159
are in common in this

610
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,839
because uh

611
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,159
the second list from m

612
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,119
carries the time the encryption of the

613
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,918
span value so you can take it to the

614

intersection

615
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,359
multiply all these

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,560
elements

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,199
multiply

618
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,560
and

619
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
statistically

620
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,000
hides the sum of the i

621
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,560
it gets back

622

the

[Music]

625
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
these calculations of how many people

626
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,200
how many people are joined

627
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,440
and how much they spent on average these

628
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
joined people

629
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,599
is very important for

630
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,480
organizing this content campaign

631
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,000
content being

632
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,720
advertisement coupons

633
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,960
and and other other other possible tools

634
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
but the main thing the main thing is

635
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
that nobody learns any individual

636
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,480
element

637
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,960
g only learns how many are in the

638
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
intersection

639
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,400
and how much they

640
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,079
expand in total

641
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,520
of course they review some upper bound

642
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,960
because they can paddle it with

643
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,079
so what happened with

644
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,400
these solutions so first of all

645
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,440
you need analytics

646
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,119
and then

647
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,760
once the first group implemented it and

648
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
it was known

649
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,000
it was otherwise in a number of cases

650
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,720
and variations of the protocol were

651
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
implemented this protocol is just one

652
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,200
variant

653
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
and this runs routinely

654
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,880
and brings analytics based on aggregate

655
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
data

656
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,880
and it's really now in the system

657
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,640
for example you heard about google

658
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,720
password checking

659
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
where you want to know if your password

660
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,440
is a list of compromises

661
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,520
in a

662
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
list of compromised passwords

663
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
so the technology to do this is also

664
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,800
based on the

665
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,520
private intersection

666
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,770
[Music]

667
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,400
and without the other side learning what

668
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
you found because you can find it

669
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
locally

670
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
so

671
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,680
you see that

672
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
this is again it's kind of offline

673
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,680
it's not really real time

674
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,400
but it serves users

675
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,839
this was then open source is

676
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,520
something that we call the join and

677
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,720
compute

678
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,919
because you can think about

679
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,240
intersections some population

680
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,119
and then it was adopted for other other

681
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,200
things but

we extended it

to malicious parties

689
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,640
which required

690
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,359
and

691
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,680

the sentiment of 2007 that is the end of

you know

it was

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,520
the end of crypto research was

713
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
promoted

714
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,319
from a point of view of self-interest

715
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,400
oh people who wanted to say that their

716
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,560
research is more important

717
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
to research

718
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,800
but that's not just the way to be to be

719
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
right

720
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
in the future if you want to be right in

721
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,079
the

722
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,799
future for computing is gone

723
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,639
[Music]

724
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,079
but you know

725
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,640
people um

726
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,480
but definitely

727
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,839
they thought that the

728
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,440
game is just starting

729
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,960
was

730
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,160
more correct than those

731
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
private computing groups with

732
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,760
cryptographers has become a reality in

733
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,839
the industry

734
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,400
and also by the way

735
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,720
our research showing the practicality of

736
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,839
psi for example gave a boost to psi

737
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,880
research and i think we're gonna see

738
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,520
the next session

739
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,240
is another reason that motivated me to

740
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,720
talk about this perspective

741
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,480
i mean

742
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,640
what's nice is that this initial

743
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,040
protocol environments

744
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,920
are such that the components of them

745
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,079
were

746
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,319
adapted and used for intersection for

747

[Music]

748
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,839
and

749
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,359
once people

750
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,040
saw the first

751
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,279
uh

752
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,359
the first system working is considered

753
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,760
impossible before

754
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,480
they wanted it

755
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,880
and what is the secret sauce

756
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,440
from peace

757
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,839
when you solve the fundamental industry

758
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,040
issue

759
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,160
deployment will materialize

760
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,920
but things take time

761
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,359
you need

762
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,280
patience sometimes

763
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,400
but if you know that you are

764
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,560
fundamentally correct and everybody else

765
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,520
is wrong and you do it in the right way

766
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,839
just looking at your technology maybe

767
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,440
there are other technologies and i will

768
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
talk more about

769
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,240
combining technologies

770
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,560
in the sequel

771
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,319
if you do it right

772
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,880
you will deploy

773
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
and to do this

774
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,800
to know that you are working with a

775
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,400
fundamental issue

776
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,200
you have to work closely with business

777
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,520
with engineering a new mindful of needs

778
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,680
which means deploy now

779
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,960
but you

780
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,640
is the designer of the security and

781
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,040
privacy solution think about extension

782
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,560
and what

783
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,359
why is that

784
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,640
nobody nobody builds

785
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,079
so you have to be ready for

786
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,079
demands

787
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,560
of those applications

788
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,230
which intercession

[Music]

790
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,240
the need will show up according to your

791
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,119
best estimate and then you're ready it's

792
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,440
much better

793
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,040
it's much better than designing a

794
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,079
solution

795
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,480
a and then they come to you with a

796
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
problem

797
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,160
when you say you are not ready you need

798
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,119
to start researching now

799
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,079
it's much better to have software

800
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,760
creating an existing software and

801
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,680
getting the solutions very important in

the industry

803
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,000
the success is what comes next

804
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,960
and that was important with this

805
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,040
how we move to serve other products

806
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,680
in particular

807
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,359
is an example uh

808
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,400
you have to adapt it in all the

809
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,640
cryptographic tools

810
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,800
to other system requirements

811
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,599
you get your game momentum

812
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,240
and you get more users and you get more

813

good name within the company

[Music]

816

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,359
be mindful of performance system

819

constraints and educate

the makers in smart way

821
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,880
tell them how we solve the problem

822
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,480
they understand much better their

823

performance

824
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,880
then they understand cryptography so if

825
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,960
you can tell the performance number up

826
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,400
front when you when you run your your

827
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,560
benchmarks to yourself

828
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,520
it's much better

829
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,760
you're much you're on a much solid

those numbers

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,400
know your organizations and solve the

you know

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,240
when we treat when we have a research

838
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,140
problem

[Music]

840

[Music]

841
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,279
and uh another thing which

842
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,880
is like security technologies it has

843
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,680
messy components

844
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,799
it has

845
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,079
other works that need to be done to make

846
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,000
it free

847
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,680
and the final bullet is very very

848
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,240
for security

849
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,960

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,680
solving similar problems

851
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,319
and and

852
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,200
gaining momentum

853
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,440
so these are important principles and

854
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,680
this is why it was successful in the

855
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,079
beginning

856
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,960
and this is why it is still successful

857
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,640
in gaining new applications

858
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880

the authentication is done at this stage

this stage is without application

on the

use their own blinds because

938
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,280
decouple the identity

from the authorization to access

940
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,480
and i think it's a very important tool

and it is time has come up

942
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,440
due to

it cannot be next to the owners

this is

major headache and it

01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,000
the first

1038
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,960
the first the first three bullets are

is how to prevent abuse

often with the

the fact that this device is broken

and also

1056
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,599
this is because it is

a lot of communication

the cryptography beyond the

when you design privacy because you have

01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,199
containing the

1244
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,199
technique

1245
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,159
when we had the big project

1246
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:59,320
from 2015

1247
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,280
so we gained some possibilities uh

1248
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,159
some performance

1249
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,400
feasibilities and

1250
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,760
and what baby is capable of and also of

1251
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,040
course other technologies

1252
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,519
and the question is

1253
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,480
in the company

1254
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,440
luckily for us other companies and

1255
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,239
academia also academic groups started to

1256
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,040
and have already started to investigate

1257
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,920
the

1258
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,400
question because apparently

1259
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,480
independently

1260
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,080
and

1261
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,560
it was it was very very thing

1262
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,719
to all

1263
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,760
and if you realized

1264
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:37,080
is

1265
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,559
the mobile phone

1266
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,840
we know

1267
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,719
that

1268
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,640
user data

1269
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,040
handled

1270
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,489
[Music]

1271
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,239
and some personal uh

1272
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,400
realization for me

1273
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,400
throughout the project is

1274
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,960
first of all

1275
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,000
privacy is important no need to give it

1276
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,040
up

1277
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,040
for each

1278
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,360
up problem this problem then tomorrow

1279
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,520
there will be another problem

1280
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,199
and then later

1281
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,120
when i spoke with the

1282
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,520
academic group that dealt with the same

1283
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,199
problem

1284
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,640
and people in the apple

1285
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,120
people feel the same way people tell it

1286
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,599
the same way

1287
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,719
yet

1288
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,679
it is not a pure privacy problem it's

1289
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,880
not a pure

1290
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,360
is

1291
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,880
hard

1292
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,840
you need to take care of performance

1293
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,000
usability battery

1294
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,920
let's say battery suppose you have a

1295
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,120
solution

1296
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,800
replace your battery very fast

1297
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,360
so you see that your phone

1298
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,760
that you before you installed the app

1299
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,679
that helped you with the has

1300
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,239
worked the whole day now after two hours

1301
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:34,000
you need to recharge the phone

1302
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,380
if this happens

1303
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:39,569
[Music]

1304
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,400
and unless you live in a country where

1305
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,960
apps are

1306
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,840
uh

1307
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,800
usage

1308
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,520
usability and use it

1309
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,400
and and penetration in the market

1310
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,520
because it's important to the

1311
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,840
big portion of the population we

1312
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,639
will use that

1313
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,120
last two and a half years

1314
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,120
and the development of the newborn take

1315
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,080
is

1316
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,920
on this including security and privacy

1317
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,199
threats

1318
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,679
and so on we need to check various

1319
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,600
designs

1320
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,360
and see what are the problems in

1321
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,120
principle

1322
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,080
and someone's great idea may sit in an

1323
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,280
awkward place on a trade of care

1324
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,520
whenever you're deciding to come up with

1325
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,920
a product which is in a trader

1326
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,480
there is no note of this

1327
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,440
you know

1328
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,239
there is not an obvious optimal solution

1329
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,520
opinions vary

1330
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,679
and you have to make your best

1331
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:34,960
estimates

1332
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,159
of all the constraints

1333
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,960
which includes the privacy

1334
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,280
but not in isolation this is very

1335
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,199
important

1336
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,800
okay

1337
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,400
privacy does not leave you alone

1338
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,520
you have to confront it with this system

1339
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,199
function with respect we performance

1340
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:10,320
and usability implementability and

1341
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,519
transformative issues

1342
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,800
and here's the point much as i advocated

1343
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,120
for

1344
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,679
sometimes we have a tendency

1345
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,760
to follow a scientific paper about

1346
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,280
privacy

1347
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,840
and drive the design format

1348
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,360
it will be great but it may not be

1349
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,759
the right solution

1350
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,040
where we have many

1351
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,440
many concerns

1352
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,599
so

1353
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,440
uh

1354
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,320
what happened to the project we explored

1355
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,800
various technologies

1356
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,800
numerous

1357
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:22,520
[Music]

1358
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,040
but we

1359
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,440
looked at it from pure privacy

1360
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,880
for example

1361
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,400
preserving uh based on german compute

1362
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,879
whatever

1363
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,600
more complete versions appear by other

1364
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,360
people

1365
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,560
but

1366
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,080
i did just see the price

1367
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,600
based on

1368
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,639
female ideas

1369
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,920
of infected people

1370
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,120
revealing hashtags and so on

1371
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,000
and so on

1372
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:07,840
this

1373
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,040
100 was to reveal the encryption key of

1374
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,080
you can regenerate

1375
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,199
you can

1376
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:42,000
understand the same person

1377
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,520
found in one time

1378
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,400
the same person

1379
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,719
this at the end became

1380
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,560
privacy is the key point in this design

1381
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,239
the protocol is

1382
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,040
very simple

1383
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,719
have a key random key for today

1384
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,380
10 minutes derived

1385
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,439
[Music]

1386
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,760
you need to report

1387
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:43,360
upload the 14 keys of the last 14 days

1388
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,679
then you head

1389
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,880
and every day download all published

1390
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,320
keys and checked for exposure against

1391
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,559
all

1392
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,360
144

1393
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,239
each of those keys

1394
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,719
and then

1395
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,280
you get

1396
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,159
how much exposure you had

1397
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,000
with

1398
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,280
uh

1399
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,400
ids

1400
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,320
for how long

1401
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,440
to reduce the epidemiologically

1402
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,440
whether you have been exposed

1403
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,199
and

1404
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,080
then

1405
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,600
based on this your phone is making the

1406
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,960
locally the

1407
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,520
here is the api provided by the

1408
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,000
smartphone companies and it was realized

1409
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,280
early on that it doesn't matter

1410
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,159
if you have iphone or android

1411
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:00,960
smartphones is a smartphone and you want

1412
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,840
your

1413
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,520
exposure all right so this is a simple

1414
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,920
protocol

1415
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,440
and then when the portable uh

1416
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,960
published

1417
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,760
numerous criticisms

1418
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,400
i am prosecuting and it's important that

1419
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,880
this were done

1420
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,199
yet

1421
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,320
a principle that i already mentioned

1422
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,639
about

1423
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,040
architecture layer

1424
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,719
and there are many other particular

1425
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,639
players

1426
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:03,760
the game protocol in fact does not run

1427
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,880
in the user's space at all

1428
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,520
but this

1429
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:12,400
is other money

1430
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,560
you don't want it

1431
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,199
automatically

1432
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:23,679
network protocol to be based on the user

1433
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,080
wishes

1434
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:31,199
and then if the user tries to

1435
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,440
jailbreak the phone and

1436
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,000
interfere with the protocol

1437
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
then

1438
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,159
that's one thing

1439
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:56,480
i discuss those cryptographic attacks

1440
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,480
to the fact that it is not just the

1441
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,560
cryptography there are the players that

1442
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,000
are helping it

1443
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,480
in the right place in the architecture

1444
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,400
it's very important to locate things in

1445
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,560
the right way

1446
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,120
also what tasks are done

1447
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,080
the reasonable cost to the attacker is

1448
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,400
an important issue this is the core of

1449
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,799
risk analysis

1450
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,280
if

1451
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,000
i can find

1452
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,480
five people who are sick with their

1453
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,800
identities

1454
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,360
is it worth that i will pay 100 000

1455
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,280
dollars for it

1456
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,280
if i can fool

1457
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,760
10 people to stay at home when they

1458
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,800
don't need to stay at home

1459
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,040
in order to

1460
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,440
the right incentive to mount this attack

1461
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,000
for the right cost

1462
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,159
the secret

01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,960
the joint system

1466
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,159
together is

1467
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,400
the privacy

1468
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,080
it's not just the protocol it's not just

1469
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,080
the software it's not just the

1470
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,880
algorithm is very simple

1471
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,880
is important you have to view it this

1472
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,840
way

1473
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,159
it's very nice to have nice personal

1474
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,520
protocols

1475
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,080
however it is important to come up with

1476
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,520
system

1477
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,880
and when you come up with a system

[Music]

1479
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,120
an exploration of the problem

1480
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,840
so when apps were running with

1481
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,440
virginia tech team

1482
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,640
base team

1483
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:32,799
[Music]

1484
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,600
with students that are going to

1485
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,480
try to break forms

1486
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,839
and do it

1487
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:52,799
this year

1488
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,840
we realized it is private to all but

1489
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,760
very extreme and costly attacks

1490
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,560
and

1491
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,280
we studied his techniques

1492
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,239
approves this choice

1493
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,320
and running these protocols

1494
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,360
and

1495
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,120
so

1496
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,159
two years or so running no attacking was

1497
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:19,799
noticed in practice

1498
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,600
and uh

1499
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:33,639
and uh this is one thing this is this

1500
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:36,639
is part of

1501
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,400
multiple community technology

1502
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
in a paper you probably want to write a

1503
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,239
paper in a circle

1504
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:49,120
in a system you want to add security

1505
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,639
measures to your protocol to cope up

1506
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:53,600
with

1507
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,800
added

1508
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,280
risks

1509
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,560
so this is essentially what we found

1510
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,440
when we published

1511
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,480
existing form

1512
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,360
phones apple and google

1513
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,840
and investigate

1514
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,560
the risk in the real on our own actual

1515
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,000
system

1516
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,159
systems

1517
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:34,560
so that's one thing second thing further

1518
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,560
for security

1519
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,199
of the apps as a whole

1520
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:43,559
researchers and engineers

1521
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,199
this

1522
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:00,159
to allow year

1523
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,320

1524
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,480

1528
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,520
private communities are not

1529
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,199
collaborating

1530
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,040
it shows that for the common good

1531
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,360
purpose one would find independent

1532
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,759
servers

1533
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,000
and the secrets of

jesus privacy

1535
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,159
and when you need to add computing

1536
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:36,159
don't give up the privacy

1537
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,520
instead build the private procedure on

1538
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,400
top of it kind of

1539

[Music]

1540
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,560
i'm terribly sorry but uh we need to

1541
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,320
come to so sort of a conclusion

1542
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,840
relatively soon

1543
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,000
uh because i think people have lots of

1544
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,040
questions

1545
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,159
and we only have like five more minutes

1546
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,040
okay

1547
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:15,920
so

1548
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,920
yes

to other uh like clear and so on

1551
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,679

01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,320
you have to explore it in this context

1555
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,360
and

1556
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,839
usually

1557
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,480
done right

1558
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:00,960
then

1559
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,920
it can gain momentum and be used

1560
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,880
it is quite rewarding to be involved in

1561
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,840
specifying designing and deploying this

1562
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,639
this is happening industry right now

01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:13,679
uh

1564
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,840
it's always starting small having a good

1565
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,159
super extension and then you can do it i

1566
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,780
give a few takeaways

1567
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,898
[Music]

1568
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,520

01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,440
and

1571
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,080
finally in many situations ending

1572
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,960
privacy allows one to perform more

1573
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,239
complications under constraint

1574
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,800
and with respect to the user because

1575
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,280
otherwise it cannot be done

1576
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,440
hence i will finish by saying the

1577
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,360
precious technologies like car brakes

1578
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,000
brakes were originally interviews to

1579
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,600
allow cars not to allow us to stop but

1580
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,239
allow them to accelerate and speed up

1581
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,959
and then so

1582
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:27,509
[Music]

1583
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,800
is

1584
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,280
so thank you very much

1585
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,159
that was a very nice conclusion

1586
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,639
okay so i wrote down six or seven
