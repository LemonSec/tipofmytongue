00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,480
hello all

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,640
my name is moses namara from clemson

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,040
university and on behalf of my

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
co-authors henry and bud kainenbach i'm

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,639
here to present our research work

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,759
on the

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
effectiveness of adaptation presentation

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
methods in improving user engagement and

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,359
privacy protection on social network

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439
sites

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,400
today

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,599
a number of users use social network

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,640
sites

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
to make a number of privacy decisions

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,800
using the privacy controls or features

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
on on these sites

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,800
however research finds that these users

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
fail to use these

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,079
features for a number of different

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,960
reasons for example privacy decisions

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
are difficult to make

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,600
uh number two users at a time simply

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
unaware about the privacy features and

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
therefore struggle to find them

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,079
and number three privacy protection is

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,199
not the primary end user task on most of

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,920
the social network sites

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
to help increase awareness and usage of

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
privacy features

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
a number of privacy researchers have

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,640
advocated for adaptive

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,799
approaches that could

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
help or that involve modeling user

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
privacy preferences

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,520
and automatically tailoring privacy

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,880
settings

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,320
to match

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,600
the user's privacy preferences

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,759
so basically the idea being that

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,520
we can learn about

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
the user's behaviors or characteristics

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
and use those to

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,119
come up with models that

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
we can then apply

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
and help

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
help users

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
either

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,000
help users

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,079
uh help users in their privacy decision

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,360
making process

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,320
most especially in how in application of

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
the privacy controls uh on most of these

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,240
sites

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
now while a lot of workers really

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,159
focused on the measurement and modeling

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,119
aspects

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,079
of these adaptive approaches

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,799
less workers really focused on how to

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,520
really exactly adapt the system so

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
once we have once we know of users

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
preferences once we have models that we

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
can apply

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,239
to help

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,640
bridge that gap

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,599
how then would we present to users

66
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,319
these are the privacy adaptations

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
and so this is the major focus

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
of this research work

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
now inspired by previous work that has

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,599
proposed three

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
adaptation

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,120
presentation methods

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
number one being suggestions which is

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
basically

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,319
saying once we have once we learn of

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,800
users preferences and we have a model

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
for them

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
we can

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,760
suggest or we can proactively recommend

80
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
a privacy action to the user using a

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,440
suggestion

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
or we can highlight we can basically

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,239
increase the visual prominence of a

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
privacy feature to encourage the user to

85
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
undertake a certain privacy action

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,239
or

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
on the other hand we can automate which

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,040
is basically we automatically

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,319
apply

90
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
the

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
the the privacy feature so the action of

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,159
the privacy feature without first

93
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,280
requesting uh user permission

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
and

95
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
just inform the user of the action that

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,879
has been taken on their behalf by the

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
system

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
now inspired by this work we really

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
wanted to

100
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
examine three research questions number

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
one being which adaptation presentation

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
methods of these three that who have

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,239
been proposed by prayer work are you

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,760
really effective at improving user

105
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
engagement to the privacy features

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,519
number two based on their default

107
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,000
application and user engagement patterns

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,519
which adaptation

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
presentation methods offer better

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,080
overall privacy protection outcomes

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,599
and number three which adaptation

112
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
presentation method would users find

113
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
most helpful

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,200
to do this we set up an experiment that

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
that helped us answer these research

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,080
questions

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,599
in this experiment

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,239
for this experiment we we had a semi we

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,880
developed a semi marking prototype of

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,639
a social network site that we termed

121
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
friend book which was best of the user

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
interface of the facebook web

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,919
application

124
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
here we did this for three reasons we

125
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,479
developed our own site our own prototype

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
to number one increase the realism and

127
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,960
ecological validity of the experiment

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
and also it also made it easy to apply

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,479
and present the privacy

130
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,240
adaptations depending on the

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,479
experimental conditions as we'll see in

132
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
the next slides

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,280
and to really help drive

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
the the experiment we had a scenario

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
that invited the participants to imagine

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
that they were looking for a job

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,759
and therefore they had to own this

138
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,560
profile and also review and make certain

139
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
this privacy related decisions

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,479
when it came so we had over

141
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,120
406 participants partake in this

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
experimental study

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,919
but we had eight experimental conditions

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,039
the

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
first experimental condition was a

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
baseline uh was was a default condition

147
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,600
which served as a baseline

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
condition

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
and in this particular condition we

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
basically did not

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
have any adaptations applied at all so

152
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,199
there were no

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
adaptations made in this particular

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,160
condition

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,840
for the other conditions here where you

156
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,280
see the all we had we aimed to adapt 13

157
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
privacy features

158
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
which

159
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
and

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
and based on these conditions

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
from c2 to c5

162
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
we adapted

163
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
we adapted them

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
accordingly respect or irrespective of

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
whether the user perception about the

166
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,919
adaptation of that

167
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,080
privacy feature was was appropriate or

168
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,880
not

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
so this was primarily guided by prayer

170
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,639
work that said

171
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,360
while we might apply these adaptation

172
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
presentation methods some of them might

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
be awkward and some of them users might

174
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,400
find them

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
having

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
having irreversible consequences if they

177
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
were

178
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
enacted without their consent or

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,919
or knowledge at all

180
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,120
so for c2 to c4 what we did was

181
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,639
basically

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,440
all the 13 privacy features were adapted

183
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
to the user uh

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
to the user using one of the three

185
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
adaptation presentation methods so

186
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
either we automated all the 13 privacy

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,160
feature or highlighted all the privacy

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
13 privacy features or we provide a

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,599
suggestion for all the certain privacy

190
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,800
features

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
in the tailored condition we basically

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
tailored

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,199
the

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,000
adaptation methods themselves so

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
based on

196
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,400
how frequently on how and how

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
how frequently users indicated they use

198
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
the privacy feature or how aware they

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
were of the privacy feature

200
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
specifically

201
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
the automation adaptation was applied to

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
any privacy

203
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
feature the participants used frequently

204
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,759
or indicated using frequently on

205
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,039
facebook

206
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
the highlight adaptation was applied to

207
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
any privacy feature the participants

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
indicated to using only occasionally

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
and no adaptation was applied if the

210
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
user had

211
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
conscious consciously decided not to use

212
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
the privacy feature

213
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
that is to say they were aware of the

214
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,319
previous feature but never used it or

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,800
used it only once and then abandoned it

216
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
and then suggestions were suggestion

217
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,599
adaptations were applied if the user was

218
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,160
not aware of the of the future itself

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,280
for

220
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,879
for c6 to c8 we basically then adapted

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,720
this previous 13 privacy feature in

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
accordance with the user perception

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
about the appropriateness of the

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
adaptation whether it was awkward or

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
reversible

226
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,240
uh uh all resulted into an irreversible

227
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
consequence consequence

228
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,020
so that's how these eight

229
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,240
[Music]

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
experimental conditions

231
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
came up

232
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,960
now let me go to the results

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
in the experiment we basically recorded

234
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,639
the

235
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
we recorded the interactions of of the

236
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
users with the different

237
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
uh

238
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,679
with the different

239
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
privacy adaptations that

240
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
they encountered or met

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
and subsequently once they were done

242
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,920
we

243
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,839
were subsequent once they were done

244
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
making their decisions we also asked

245
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,760
them about the

246
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
helpfulness of the previous adaptations

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
depending on their conditions

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,200
now

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
what we observed or what we found was

250
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,959
that

251
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,760
we when we compared

252
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
the baseline conditions against all the

253
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,480
other conditions in terms of

254
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
the engagement that we saw

255
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
so

256
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
within these

257
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
particular

258
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
experimental conditions participants had

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
five actions that they could take

260
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
so they could either

261
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
manually accept which is

262
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
the participant manually interacted with

263
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
the previous future that was not adapted

264
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,399
or they rejected the adaptation

265
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,240
initially but then manually restricted

266
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
their their privacy after all

267
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,680
or they could explicitly accept which

268
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
was the participant explicitly accepted

269
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
the adaptation

270
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,320
either by approving the suggestion

271
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,399
in this case if they made a suggestion

272
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,080
by clicking ok

273
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
engaging with a highlighted feature or

274
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
verifying the automated adaptation by

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
clicking ok

276
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
all the implicitly accepted which is the

277
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
participant ignored and automated

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
adaptation thereby

279
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
implicitly

280
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
accepting it because remember in this

281
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,279
particular instance for automation

282
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
usually the feature was

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
restricted to higher privacy setting

284
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
all they implicitly rejected which is

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,319
basically

286
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
ignored they either ignored the

287
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
highlighted feature or the suggested

288
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
adaptation or simply didn't interact

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
with the privacy feature at all or

290
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
explicitly rejected which is basically

291
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,040
the participant explicitly rejected the

292
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
suggestion by clicking rather not or the

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
adaptation

294
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,040
or the adaptation feature by clicking

295
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,399
undo

296
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,560
and so what we found

297
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
we basically captured

298
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
the

299
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
the different

300
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,079
um

301
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,839
actions they took under each of these

302
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,200
conditions

303
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
and what we saw was that

304
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,399
compared to the default

305
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,120
condition where no adaptations were

306
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,399
applied

307
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
we saw higher engagement patterns

308
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
in conditions where adaptations were

309
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,000
applied

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,040
specifically we saw a higher engagement

311
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
rate

312
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
when privacy suggestions were

313
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,480
provided by a system when we asked about

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
the usefulness of the system depending

315
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,600
on

316
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
on the condition we found that the sum

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,079
suggestion condition where there were

318
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
some suggestions for some of the

319
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
features was was perceived to be the

320
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
most helpful compared to the default or

321
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,959
compared to the non-condition

322
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,200
the key takeaways were mainly two

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,120
number one automation of privacy

324
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
settings to a district settings can help

325
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
improve user previous protection on

326
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
social media sites

327
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,839
and number two

328
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
some privacy suggestions are an optimal

329
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,880
way to help improve user engagement with

330
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
available privacy features while also

331
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
increasing privacy protection and

332
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
perceived help

333
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
the key takeaway was basically if

334
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
applied correctly we

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
found that previous suggestions had the

336
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
had the most potential to really

337
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
encourage

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,839
users to actively

339
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,959
uh

340
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
own

341
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
or take charge

342
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
over their privacy

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,600
based on

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
their application and engagement with

345
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
their privacy features

346
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320
i would like to thank you for taking the

347
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
time to listen to me

348
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,639
thank you very much for

349
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,839
attending this session
