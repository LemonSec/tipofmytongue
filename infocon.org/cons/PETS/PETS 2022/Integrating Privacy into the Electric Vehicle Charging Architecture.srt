00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,000
hello everyone i am dustin jian and i

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
will present in our work on integrating

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,520
privacy into the electric vehicle

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,480
charging architecture

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,080
electric vehicles are generally

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
considered 80 points in the development

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,599
of an environmentally friendly

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,360
transportation sector

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
which is why there's been a lot of

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,880
advocation for more ev adoption over the

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
past few years

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
and we can see that for example the

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,519
global number of evs had already

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
exceeded 60 million last year

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
eb is not only charged at home but often

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,240
also at public charge points to make

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,599
this process as user-friendly as

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,040
possible several roles with backend

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,399
systems have been established over the

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,600
past years

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
and several communication protocols have

22
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,200
also been developed to enable the

23
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,879
automated exchange of information

24
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,800
between these actors

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,559
hereby an important feature is plugin

26
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,960
charge whereby an ev uses locally

27
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,360
installed credentials to automatically

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
authenticate itself at a charge points

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,879
for charge acquisition billing

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,719
now the respective communication was a

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
variety of personal data however it does

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,359
not include appropriate privacy

33
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,640
considerations

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
so for example a current protocol simply

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
transfers that user ids together with

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
the location and time of charge sessions

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
which allows an adversary to trade

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,640
movement profiles or inferior

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
consumer habits

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,560
for this reason it is important to

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,799
consider privacy preserving alternatives

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,640
for the existing processes in the

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
immobility architecture

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,000
but first some backgrounds without

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
indian both actors and processors uh

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,000
specifically for contract based platinum

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
charge

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
besides the evin charge point there are

49
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
three background actors first the

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
e-mobility service provider the emsp

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,119
with whom the ev user has a contract for

52
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,960
charge authorization and billing

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
next the charge point operator the cpo

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
who manages the charge points and

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
communicates with them for things like

56
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
load balancing and metering

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
and finally the transfer clearinghouse

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,960
which serves as a roaming flood platform

59
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
between several emsps and cpos in order

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
to enable a baseline contract

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
charging at charge points that are not

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
operated by the user's emsp

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
now regarding the processes we start

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
with constant financial installation for

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
this and ev comes pre-installed for a

66
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,560
provisional credential from its

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
manufacturer

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
which uniquely identifies the sweetel

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
and is provided by the ebu user to the

70
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
emsp during the conclusion of a charging

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
contract

72
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
now after the eevee is connected to a

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
charge point they can send a retest for

74
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
contract credentials this request

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
contains provision credentials and is

76
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
forwarded via the page and actors to the

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
emsp

78
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
response via the reverse path with

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
contract credentials which legally

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
identified contract between user and

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,480
emsp

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,319
afterwards the e v can authenticate

83
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
itself at a charge point via potential

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,040
charge

85
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
based on a change response protocol

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
using the received credentials

87
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
additionally the

88
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
discharge points

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
verifies that the evs authorized to

90
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
charge by sending a request via the

91
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
backend to the emsp which includes the

92
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
user's front side identifier and the

93
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,879
charge location

94
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,640
now during a charge session the charge

95
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
point periodically queries its

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
electricity meter

97
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
and can optionally trust the signature

98
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
of the measure values from the ev called

99
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
meter line received

100
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
finally after the charge session is

101
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
complete the charge point

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
reports all

103
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,120
billion relevant data to its cpo who

104
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
follows this data through emsp

105
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
this data then includes the user's

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
contact identifier and the charge

107
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
rotation as well as transaction

108
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
information which means things like the

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
time and duration of charge the consumed

110
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,799
energy the applicable travels and so on

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,400
for the identification of security and

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
privacy requirements we analyze the

113
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,480
e-charging system model for threats

114
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
considering three different adversaries

115
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
with relevance for eb charging

116
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
first a network catcher meaning a dollar

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
of yao adversary with full control over

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
the network who cannot break the triple

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
draft primitives

120
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
second a local adversary who can

121
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,519
physically tamper with evs and charge

122
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
points and it's straight and modify and

123
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,720
distort

124
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,319
data on the system unless it is tempo

125
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,480
protected and third we consider honest

126
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
but us operators who do not deviate from

127
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
the defined portal but attempt to learn

128
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
as much information as possible from

129
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
legitimately received messages

130
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
resulting in security for its mainly

131
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
concerned spoof of evil users as the

132
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
credentials are insufficiently protected

133
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
from a local adversary

134
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,798
and resulting privacy threats mainly

135
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,120
showed that every patent actor receives

136
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
enough link to build data

137
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
like long-term pseudonyms or charge

138
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,199
locations to build detailed movement

139
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
profiles of ev users

140
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,040
in order to address the resulting

141
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
threats we propose an extension for

142
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
platinum charge protocols to enable

143
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,919
privacy preserve and charge

144
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,840
authorization in billing that remains

145
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
compatible with the general procedures

146
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
and data flows of current even charger

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,479
protocols

148
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
to enable an easy integration

149
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
the basic idea is to use a trusted

150
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
platform module so a tpm 2.0 in the

151
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,960
eevee as a hardware security module for

152
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
secured credential storage and usage

153
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
additionally the ev's signatures are

154
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
replaced with anonymous signatures based

155
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
on direct anonymous attestation

156
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,600
dna

157
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
and instead of using the evs contract id

158
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
for charge organizational building we

159
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,720
generate totals based on h magic that

160
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,199
are unlinkable by anyone but the emsp

161
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,520
starting with credential installation

162
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,199
for which the evs portion differentials

163
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,199
are now stored in the evs tbm

164
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
first the ev generates a dna p pair in

165
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,199
its tpm

166
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,919
afterwards the ev can send an encrypted

167
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
credential request including the public

168
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
daag and a signature based on the

169
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
provisional credentials

170
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
after receiving the

171
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,600
request an emsp can verify the data and

172
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
generate a daa constraint credential

173
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
based on the received publication

174
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
additionally the emsp generates a

175
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
symmetry for the generation of

176
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,000
authorization tokens and then trips

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
situated data for the evs tpm

178
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
now for charge authorization the eevee

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
starts by generating a new session

180
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
keeper and its typion

181
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
afterwards the e assigns the publication

182
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
key with its daag so it's an unlinkable

183
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
dia signature and generates an

184
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
authorization token with its a method

185
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
key that should only be linked by the

186
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
msp for building purposes

187
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,440
the generated data is sent to the charge

188
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
point which can verify the dsa signature

189
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,880
based on the emsp's publicly

190
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
additionally the charge authorization

191
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
status can be verified by the request to

192
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
the msp including the receive token

193
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
if all the reputations pass the evs

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
click the charge and can use the session

195
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,800
g for any signatures during the charge

196
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
session like signing meter seats

197
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
and to secure the binding between evus

198
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,199
authorization and billing data

199
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
for the billing of the charge session

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
the cpo is still informed about the

201
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
user's consumption

202
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
and the user's emsp thus the cpu can

203
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
still build the emsp for the user's

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
transmitted energy

205
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
the msp indirect hands is informed about

206
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
the user's consumption and can identify

207
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,560
user based on the used authorization

208
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
data

209
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
which means that an emsp is still able

210
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
to build its users for their charging

211
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
sessions but none of the ideas can link

212
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
any long-term identity of the user to a

213
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
location anymore

214
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,639
notes real value is the proposed

215
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,160
extension with regards to practical and

216
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
usability aspects we implemented it as a

217
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,880
proof of concept using spy pies for ev

218
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
and charge points created via powerline

219
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
communication

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
tv was equipped with a hardware tpm and

221
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
the charge point communicated via its

222
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
wireless uplink with the pageants

223
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
which was implemented as separate

224
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
virtual machines on pc

225
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,280
results show that the extension only

226
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
adds relatively low amounts of

227
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
communication computational overheads

228
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
when compared to a reference

229
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
implementation and it shows that the

230
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,319
extension remains within the time main

231
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,160
and size contains of existing standards

232
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,759
additionally it shows that the extension

233
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,120
can be integrated into existing

234
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,199
standards with only minor changes since

235
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,440
it is compatible with its goals and data

236
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
flows

237
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
moreover it shows that the extension

238
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
still supports existing features that go

239
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
beyond the basic authorization building

240
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
processes like meter seats charge point

241
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
reservations credential installation

242
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,680
with certified pools

243
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
and so on

244
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
now in order to evaluate the security

245
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,039
and privacy of our extension we used the

246
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
timer improver which is a tool for

247
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,479
automated symbolic protocol verification

248
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
in summary in a protocols model is a set

249
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
of rules that basically define all

250
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
communication and data processing steps

251
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
additionally you can define your

252
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,759
security environments as trace

253
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
properties that should hold for all

254
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
possible execution traces of the model

255
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,400
now to verify this properties timeline

256
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
starts with a state where the poverty

257
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,599
has been violated and performs a bad

258
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,799
word search

259
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
over the possible rule institutions

260
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,159
to determine whether there is a valid

261
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
path that leads to the state

262
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
the output is either a counter example

263
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
so an execution path that violates the

264
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
property or else the proof that a

265
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
violation of the property would also

266
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
contradict the model which means the

267
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,040
property holds analysis is performed in

268
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
the symbolic model whereby the adversary

269
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
has complete control over the network

270
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
and tryptophan primitives are assumed to

271
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,959
be perfectly secure

272
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
for the verification of these security

273
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
terms we assume that the patent

274
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,839
communication is done by secure channel

275
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,839
for example via tls

276
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
which is the case in proven protocols

277
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
however the adversary has completions

278
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
hold over to charge points

279
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
instrumentation or to model a local

280
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
adversary that has tampered with the

281
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,920
charge point

282
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
with regards to security requirements we

283
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
mainly verify authentication properties

284
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
based on the commonly used notion of

285
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
injective agreements

286
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
so we verify injective agreements

287
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
without the credential insulation charge

288
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
authorization of billing data

289
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,519
on the example of authorization this

290
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,160
means that whenever an emsp authorizes a

291
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
charge station

292
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,279
which was apparently initiated by

293
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,920
specific evie then we know that this ev

294
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,560
has requested the authorization and both

295
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,959
actors agree on the contained data

296
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,720
and each transit authorization

297
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
corresponds to a unique request

298
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
now with regards to privacy requirements

299
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
we mainly focus on unlinkability

300
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,880
properties using timeline's

301
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
observational equivalence model

302
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
whereby we showed the adversary can not

303
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,560
decide whether two portable runs

304
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
meaning provincial installations charge

305
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
authorizations or billion

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
were initiated by the same evie or by

307
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
two different evs

308
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,440
as mentioned before the only exception

309
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
is because ear must be for building

310
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
purposes i will show that the emsp is

311
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
not able to create movement profiles of

312
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,079
the users by verifying unlikability

313
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
between users and locations

314
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
which is verified by showing that they

315
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
cannot decide whether to charge of an ev

316
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,519
were done at either the same charge

317
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,079
points or different charge points

318
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
in rotation i would say that while

319
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
privacy is important for the charging

320
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,279
architecture it is currently not

321
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,040
appropriately considered by related

322
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
protocols and a lot of personal data is

323
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
unnecessarily revealed to a variety of

324
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
actors

325
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
to address this issue we proposed a

326
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
privacy preserving extension for charge

327
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
authorization billion based on a

328
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
detailed security and privacy analysis

329
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
our particular evaluation shows that the

330
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
extension can be integrated into

331
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
existing protocols of only minor changes

332
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
and small overheads by maintaining

333
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
compatibility with existing roles and

334
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,839
processes

335
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,480
additionally we provide symbolic proofs

336
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
to show that these desired security and

337
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
privacy properties are fulfilled

338
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,399
and that i would like to thank you for

339
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,279
attention
