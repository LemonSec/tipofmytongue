00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
hello everyone my name is kara kubichik

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,720
and with the team of people from ethh

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
tourish we studied how our website

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
sending marketing emails and if they

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,040
collect for its proper consent

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,680
maybe you've seen an email account full

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,359
of emails like this

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,920
and this is directly problem of course

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
for the users but indirectly

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
also for the marketers because the users

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
are unsubscribing

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
when they investigated the reasons for

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,440
up subscribing of users they found that

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
among the most common is that users

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
don't remember ever subscribing to such

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,040
services

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,559
does it mean that

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,879
they really

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,879
just don't remember

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
where they subscribed to or does it mean

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,160
that

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,239
the service actually shared the email

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
addresses to third parties

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,920
this is something that

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,800
we will also show in this study

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
since it is a problem it is regulated

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,680
namely in european union there are

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,159
two laws eprivacy directive which

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,479
requires opt-in that is the reason why

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,159
we are seeing now checkboxes for

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,159
uh agreeing with sending marketing

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,200
emails

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
and then gdpr the general data privacy

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
regulation which describes how consent

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
should be given

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,200
and the goal of this study is to

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
create a data set and analyzed by that

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,920
how our websites complied with these

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
regulations

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
we annotated data set by registering to

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,799
websites

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
as a source of websites we took alex out

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,159
of one million list and we geometrically

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,840
sampled it

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
and then

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
uh for each of the sampled websites we

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
registered there using unique email

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
address

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,799
uh weber and our seven legal annotators

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,680
were

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
registering to the websites using this

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,439
annotator interface

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,560
and

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,600
uh

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,920
it looks like follows so for example

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,318
this website is asking here for date of

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,080
birth which corresponds to the legal

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
requirement of collecting the age

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,599
then it is asking for consent for

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,680
marketing emails therefore

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
the annotator marks that constant is

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
present it is done by checkbox but this

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
checkbox is not pre-checked or forced or

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
checked by user

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
lastly before the registration user

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
agrees with the terms and conditions in

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
privacy policy

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
uh this is not by a checkbox this is

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
implicit so it is forced agreement with

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
privacy policy and terms and conditions

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
every website was annotated twice

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
and the kohanskapa for measuring the

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,319
inter annotator agreement was 74 percent

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
if that is not enough

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,040
for those that disagreed for those

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,519
annotations that disagreed we

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,360
repeat it

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
and resolved the annotation by a third

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,159
annotate

80
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,400
the oldest procedure applied to 1000

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
websites resulted in 666 successful

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,560
registrations

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
from that we got 568

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,120
websites that were sending us and emails

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
the first 5000 emails that we received

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,640
be

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
annotated as marketing or servicing with

88
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
some subcategories let's look at the

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,599
subcategories

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,280
um so servicing emails are those that

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,920
are only for the

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,239
purpose of interaction with the service

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,319
while marketing are for monetization

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,319
but when we register

95
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,360
um

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
there is

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
a double opt-in procedure that

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
is the best practice to

99
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
check not only the content during the

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,840
registration but also checking that

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,319
you are indeed holding the email address

102
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,840
such that you cannot register for

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
someone else

104
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
that is very recommended also it comes

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
out of law and it is followed by roughly

106
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
sixty percent of websites

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
however more than one third of websites

108
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
is sending only confirmation of the

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
registration

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
so

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
uh there is no

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
uh check that the email address is free

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
owned by the registrant

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
but what is the most critical is that

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,000
5.5 of websites are sending directly

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,320
marketing emails without any

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
servicing information before that

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,960
we are very conservative in this study

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
and we mark

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,120
only the last situation as a potential

121
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
violation

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
while the more than one-third of

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,040
websites believe in the gray zone here

124
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
other

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
uh inside

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
uh from was from the content of the

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
emails so we observed that more than 15

128
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
percent of websites were listening

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,880
missing legal notice that this

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,120
information about the company

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,160
and we also noticed that 3.5 percent of

132
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
websites were not providing users any

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
option to unsubscribe from the

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
emails

135
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,400
um

136
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,960
another insight from the content is that

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
when users registered and provided

138
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
password 2.3 percent of websites were

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
sending the password in plain text uh

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
inside of the mail

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,400
mail the smtp protocol is not encrypted

142
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
and also it

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
signalizes the chance that actually the

144
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
website is handling the data

145
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,440
not accordingly to the

146
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
best practices

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
so this violation of the

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
gdpr requirement

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
for using the security practices the

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
article 32

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
and because it's not encrypted also

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
any other authentication methods that

153
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
are going through the emails were

154
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,800
possible to hijack but

155
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
again we are not flagging this as a

156
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
potential violation

157
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
uh we also investigated if the websites

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
are sharing the uh email address with

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
third party so

160
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,960
in majority of cases this is not

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
happening but

162
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
we investigated when we were receiving

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
emails from multiple different domains

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
also often it's just that

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,639
the second level domain is different but

166
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,880
only in four point one percent

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
the domain

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,280
of sanders three was different so then

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
we investigated in detail what

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
how was it disclosed uh

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,479
often this was clearly that

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
the website is belonging to the company

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,800
so for example facebook mail

174
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,440
dot com is sending emails for facebook

175
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
in other cases it was disclosed in the

176
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
registration form which is also fine

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
what is not that okay is when they

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,880
disclose it only in the privacy policy

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
or terms and conditions because it's

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
well known that users are not reading

181
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,000
these materials

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
we also found one

183
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
website that

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,960
did not disclose it at all but

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
we found connection to the other sender

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
so we found that they belong to the same

187
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
umbra company

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
and in the remaining cases these were

189
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
websites where

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
we

191
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,720
did not manage to find any information

192
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
that would disclose

193
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
the email sharing

194
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,280
in one of the cases the website uh was

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
breached and the credential leaked but

196
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
in the remaining cases we already have

197
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
no reason why

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
the email address was shared

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
and let's put this into context previous

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
studies by mature at all studied the u.s

201
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,879
presidential campaigns and there the

202
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,680
leakage was around seven percent higher

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
than our

204
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,639
observation um and that i would also say

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,680
is a

206
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,840
positive contribution of the european

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
regulations i think that

208
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,639
uh this is free because we have stronger

209
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
privacy laws

210
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
based on the annotated properties and

211
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
based on receiving emails we were able

212
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,479
to design

213
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,200
a decision procedure which says whether

214
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,039
there is a potential violation of the

215
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,880
constant or not

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,719
so we study only websites that are

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,200
sending marketing emails

218
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
and then we check if the website was

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,279
asking for any content

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
if not it means that the e-privacy

221
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,320
directive requirement opt-in is violated

222
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
then

223
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
we check if the website

224
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,640
uh only purpose was actually sending

225
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
mars

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
newsletters and if yes then this is

227
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,160
valid because uh it is clear from the

228
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,399
form that we are going to receive

229
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,600
newsletters

230
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
but if not then we need to evaluate gdpr

231
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
requirements

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
um so gdpr constant requirements is that

233
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
it has to be specific

234
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
freely given unambiguous and informed

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,279
and by our

236
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
uh proper legal properties we are able

237
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
to detect

238
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
when this is not met

239
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,320
so for example if there is no checkbox

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
then it's not specific we are not really

241
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
aware what we are consenting to

242
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,640
um

243
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
and if any of these

244
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
properties were violated it means that

245
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,920
the

246
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,080
constant is not valid constant under

247
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
gdpr requirements

248
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,240
um in the remaining case

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,000
we since we asked all the annotators to

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,320
not consent to the

251
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
marketing emails at all

252
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
um but since we are receiving emails it

253
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,880
also means that

254
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
uh we are receiving emails despite no

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
content was given so

256
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,920
that cannot even be a situation when we

257
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,959
would

258
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,680
for example be forced to console because

259
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
then it would not be free constant but

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
at this very situation that

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,399
there is a checkbox we left it unchecked

262
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
and we are still receiving emails

263
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,959
marketing emails

264
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
this slide then

265
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,680
summarizes our observations so these

266
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
five potential violations are in the

267
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
emails

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
and these are of the

269
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,240
constant procedure

270
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,680
then here it is aggregated to the number

271
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
of violations by a website

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,959
so

273
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
the green bar does not necessarily say

274
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
that these websites are compliant they

275
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
are just missing these types of

276
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
violations that we were observing

277
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
also keep in mind that we were very

278
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,240
conservative with all the measures

279
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
so for example already in the um no

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
single opt-in

281
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
we decided to

282
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,079
only the situation when there was

283
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
immediately marketing email

284
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
classifiers potential violation but

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
there were like one-third of websites

286
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,640
that were only sending confirmation

287
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
emails so re the study is trying to be

288
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
conservative as possible

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
our future work plans to automate this

290
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,120
whole procedure so we to do that we need

291
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
to automate the classification of the

292
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
legal properties

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
and the proof of concept was already

294
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,480
presented in our work

295
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
and then second part is automating the

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
registration procedure for that we are

297
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
implementing crawler that is able to

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,839
register to

299
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,920
websites then

300
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
when we have that and we observe some

301
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,399
violations we want to cooperate with

302
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,480
data protection authorities to provide

303
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,279
them

304
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,440
such automated tools to

305
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,720
i'll scale up their analysis of websites

306
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,279
and enforcement

307
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
the conclusions are that we designed

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,839
legal taxonomy and decision procedure

309
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
based on these legal properties

310
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
that decides

311
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,600
whether website is having a potential

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
violation or not

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,399
we applied this to 1000 websites that we

314
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
annotated and based on the annotations

315
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
we analyzed them and reported seven

316
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,800
types of potential violations found on

317
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,279
21.9 of websites

318
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,240
um

319
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
these are again the authors

320
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
on this website you can find

321
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
any information to this work and summary

322
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
and also there is form for access of the

323
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
data set

324
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
thank you for your attention

325
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
have a nice day
