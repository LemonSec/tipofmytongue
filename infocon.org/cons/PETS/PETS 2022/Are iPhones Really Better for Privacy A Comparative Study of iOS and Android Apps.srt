00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,960
hi my name is conor konig and i'm a

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,640
current phd student at the computer

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,160
science department of the university of

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,200
oxford

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,440
um together with my colleagues we

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,120
analyzed privacy in ios and android apps

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,960
at scale because we thought that's a

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
rather important gap in the existing

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,640
literature

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
it's an open secret that app privacy

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
problems are widespread there's been a

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,519
lot of research on android and google

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
play on that topic and for example a

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
recent study from our research group

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,520
found that

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
even after the introduction of the gdpr

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,239
this massive data protection privacy law

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,360
in the eu data sharing with facebook and

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
google reminds widespread in android

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
apps

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,960
uh meanwhile there are access very few

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,920
studies on app privacy on ios um and

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
this is despite the fact that is

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
actually the most widely app ecosystem

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,520
in the us

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
um which

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,959
arguably warrants

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,840
a look into this ecosystem by itself and

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
not just be like yeah you know

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
we look at android and so ios is

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
probably going to be similar there are

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,720
some distinct characteristics about ios

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,520
and so we think it's important to

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
look at ios and develop the right

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,119
methodology to do that

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,320
interesting the

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,799
the last large-scale study was done

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,720
nearly 10 years ago on isf privacy and

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,840
this is the

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
famous protect my privacy paper which i

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
recommend everyone read if

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
you've not done it

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
and then we've also been motivated by

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,799
apple claiming previously that's iphone

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
in its marketing campaigns and thereby

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
suggesting that android is a lot

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
performs a lot worse in terms of privacy

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
um and that's also that also explains

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
our title uh iphone's really better for

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,040
privacy that you know that's playing a

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
bit with that marketing

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
um crucially

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
we did our study before the introduction

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
of the

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,440
att and the uh and ios 14 which

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
promised to improve

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
uh user privacy

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
were introduced last year we did a

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,400
follow-up study i'm going to comment on

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
that later and how it might have changed

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,280
some of our results

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
um

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
maybe before we go into our methodology

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,879
and

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
the findings

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,599
briefly

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,640
key reasons for a lack of ios app

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,599
privacy studies in the past

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,200
um first of all

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
is a rather closed up

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
proprietary ecosystem so it tends to be

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,640
pretty difficult to do anything with it

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,280
if apple doesn't explicitly permit it

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
moreover every single app that's

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,159
downloaded from the ios app store is

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,599
encrypted with apple's fair play dm

77
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
system and that really makes accuracy

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,599
research pretty hard on ios

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
and

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
partly as a result first two points

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
there are currently

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,360
really light ready to use

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,519
publicly available app download and

84
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
analysis tools for ios

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
and motivated by the lack of existing

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
tools we decided to

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
just build our own thing which we call

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
platform control it allows the analysis

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
of ios and android app privacy at scale

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,120
it's open source it's publicly available

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
and we hope it's going to be helpful for

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,879
follow-up studies

93
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
um how did we go about analyzing app

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
privacy in our paper

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
first of all

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,560
so we

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
generated a large data set of apps

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,920
we

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
explored what apps on the google play

100
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
and apple app store with existing tools

101
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,400
and found about

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
560 000 apps

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
in this in this in this uh exploration

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
we

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
downloaded a random sample of 12 000

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
apps

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,239
per platform from from this larger data

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,480
set

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,440
to download apps on android we use the

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,479
existing gplay collide tool

111
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,479
on ios we

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
developed our own thing which we

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
publicly share

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
having downloaded a lot of apps we then

115
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
set out to investigate privacy problems

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
potential privacy problems with these

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
apps um we first did a very common thing

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
where we vote common thing that's

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
commonly done in the academic literature

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
we looked at tracking libraries and apps

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,880
um

122
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,479
on android we used these sort of

123
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,960
existing exodus privacy

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,240
um

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
database of tracker library signatures

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
on irs app we sort of replicated this

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
from android and

128
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
created a new database the first of its

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,479
kind database

130
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,520
of

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
tracking signatures on ios

132
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
permissions

133
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
are meant to regulate data flows in

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199
mobile apps which is why we looked at

135
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
apps manifest files to understand

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
uh whether and to what extent apps on

137
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,400
ios and android request permissions

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
as many of you know

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
the sort of code analysis i've described

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
upon up until now comes with a range

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,520
range of limitations specifically that

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,199
you never know whether

143
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
what you find actually happens in

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,160
practice

145
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
and so in addition to the code analysis

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,039
we did a network traffic analysis

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
uh in the usual way

148
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
disabling certificate pinning using the

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,120
open source mit and proxy tool to

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,680
sort of collect network traces and then

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,319
sort of identify problematic

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,440
api and hosts contacted hosts in the

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,319
network traffic

154
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
and then instead of

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,199
in a subsequent step

156
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,639
we

157
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
combine the insights from the code

158
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,759
analysis and the network traffic

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,960
analysis

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
through the x-ray 2020 database from our

161
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,039
research group

162
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
we um

163
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
use the state of this database connect

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
information on the networks of

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
tracking companies you know which

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
company which tracking company

167
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,080
owns which other tracking company and in

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
what country they are based and so we

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
combine the

170
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,880
insights into contacted tracking domains

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
and include tracking libraries

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,919
with

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,560
the x-ray 2020 database to understand

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
which companies receive data

175
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
and since privacy is pretty complicated

176
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,199
um we didn't just put forward a single

177
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,400
measure to

178
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,599
uh characterize privacy but rather sort

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,240
of

180
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,039
came up with fine-grained app privacy

181
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
footprints to characterize apps

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
practices

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,759
oh and you know as i mentioned all of

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
this is open source publicly available

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
and you know we hope it's going to be

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
used in follow-up studies as for our

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,280
results we made three main findings

188
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,919
um first of all we found that tracking

189
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,280
is prevalent on both ios and android

190
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
although on android

191
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
advertising related tracking tends to be

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
more common

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
which obviously can be more invasive if

194
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
tracking is conducted as part of

195
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
real-time bidding and then data is

196
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
really put up in an auction

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,479
interestingly we found that ios apps

198
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,039
tend to request more opt-in permissions

199
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,400
and especially in

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
children's apps that that can be

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,520
concerning as you know i'm going to

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
comment on in a second

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
and then last we found rather many

204
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
violations of

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
us eu uk data prediction laws such as

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,960
the use of tracking without consent the

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
sharing of pi

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
with third parties without parental

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
consent which you know violates copper

210
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
in the us that the kids privacy law

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
and all of these all of these things

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
um the right-hand side of the slide

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,479
shows the visualization of the data

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,120
flows from apps to companies to

215
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
countries

216
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
it's not a super surprising picture we

217
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,360
see that alphabet the parent company of

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,319
google

219
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,958
sort of gets most data

220
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,599
um from from from from mobile apps

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,719
anyway

222
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,039
um and that apple is also involved in

223
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,080
sort of the app data collection and then

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
this is followed by facebook

225
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
um what's also quite interesting though

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,440
not totally surprising is that the us

227
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,279
uh so the the

228
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,839
the the country that receives the most

229
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,200
data from

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
mobile apps

231
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
very briefly i'm going to

232
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
highlight two interesting further

233
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,839
findings

234
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
one of them is that

235
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
kids apps on ios include the location

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
permission a lot seven times more often

237
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,839
than on android

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,959
and

239
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
ios apps more generally

240
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
also contain the location permission a

241
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,640
lot and more so than on android

242
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
this doesn't mean that they

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
share location with that parties more

244
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,040
often but previous research

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
suggests that this may indeed be the

246
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
case

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
we also found rather frequent sharing of

248
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
the advertising id this sort of

249
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,279
cross-app user identifier with third

250
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
parties and even children's apps so

251
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
that's pretty concerning and

252
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,519
well

253
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,240
as as we find find in other parts of our

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
paper advertising related tracking

255
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
seems more common on on android and and

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
as a result the ad id is also shared

257
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,760
more often on android than is it seems

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
apple introduced a range of new privacy

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
measures with is14 and we didn't look at

260
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
that

261
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
in

262
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
the present paper that we published a

263
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
follow-up paper with the same methods

264
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
and this finds that

265
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
tracking

266
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,240
continues and so the extent of tracking

267
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
continues in the same way however the

268
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
the quality of tracking

269
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
seems to have changed tracking seems to

270
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,920
have gotten harder on is and so

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
that's why apple's privacy new privacy

272
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
measures seem to go in the right

273
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
direction

274
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,320
thank you very much
