1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,000
hi my name is cassidy gibson and i'm

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
from the university of florida today i'd

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
like to talk to you about how stalker

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,639
apps on mobile devices monetize

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,719
themselves specifically on the android

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
platform i'm going to do this and talk

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,199
today about my paper analyzing the

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,840
monetization ecosystem of soccerware

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
thank you for coming

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
today i'd like to introduce you to a

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,279
term called intimate partner violence or

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
ipv

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
you probably heard about this before

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
also known as domestic partner violence

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
domestic abuse but it's abuse between

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,920
any partners in an intimate relationship

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,719
whether this abuse is emotional physical

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,280
or psychological

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,440
and this is a global problem

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
even countries like australia and the

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,239
united states are affected by intimate

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,800
partner violence cases in fact in the

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
united states alone intimate partner

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,920
violence accounts for over 15 percent of

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
all intimate of all violent crime

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,960
over one in four women and one in 10 men

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
have experienced intimate partner

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,960
violence while it's a problem for both

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
genders the

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
victim count is heavily skewed towards

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,360
women

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,680
and this has only been a growing problem

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
since covid

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,560
in 2020 alone with the uprise of the

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
pandemic and everyone having to

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
quarantine we saw a spike of over 25 to

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
33 percent across the globe of cases

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,920
being reported of intimate partner

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
violence

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
and this is only

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,439
increased by the ability for tech

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
enabled abuse today i'd like to

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
introduce you to stalkerware it's one

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
type of tech enabled abuse that allows

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,079
of users to remotely access

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
information on

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
the victim's phone and conduct real-time

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
surveillance

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,479
it allows them to access the victim's

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,799
location view their text messages and

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
social media conversations listen to

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
phone call recordings and view their

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
call logs

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,799
and in some cases they're able to access

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
their camera and microphone allowing

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
them to see live video and

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,360
voice recordings around the phone

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
happening at that time

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
this is all done remotely where the

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,879
abuser can access it on different types

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,520
of platforms

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
so while we obviously know that

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
stalkerware developers are making money

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
in this field because why else would

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,200
they be making these apps in the first

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,840
place uh we have very little

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
understanding on how these developers

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
are actually monetizing the apps

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
furthermore companies like google and

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
apple have noticed that stalker ware is

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,000
a problem and as such are taking steps

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
to

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,120
stop soccerware on their platforms and

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
on their mobile devices google in fact

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
change their terms of services to

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
effectively disallow stalkerware from

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
all their platforms

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,360
and

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
as such

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
we want to

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,239
identify how stalker where apps are

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
monetized and use the information we

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,519
gained from this to make a

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
recommendation for a holistic approach

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
on how to stop soccerware from

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
generating revenue

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
we also want to use this monetization

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
data to then analyze how successful

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,519
google's tos change was to the stalker

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,840
ecosystem

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,239
to do this we needed to analyze or

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
identify different ways that these

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
software apps monetize themselves

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
and we identified three of these

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
the first one being in-app ad libraries

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
this is a passive way of generating

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
money and it's done through ad revenue

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,799
this can be when a user on the phone

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,560
views the ad clicks on the ad or buy

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
something on the website that the ad

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
takes them to there's also in-app

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
purchases

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
in a lot of cases not in soccerware

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,720
these are often seen as

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
microtransactions but in the case of

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
soccerware we see these as purchases of

107
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
subscriptions or extra permissions on

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
the phone and we identified them through

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
payment processors that were supported

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,319
by the app

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
finally we found evidence of external

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
websites

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959
abusers were able to purchase app

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,720
subscriptions on these websites or

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
sometimes they purchased the app and

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,160
downloaded the app from these external

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,478
websites themselves

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,639
to gain all this data we needed to have

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,960
a fairly large repository of stalkerware

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
apps and the one we finally ended up

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
using was this doctor where threat list

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
this repository is created by members of

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
the coalition against dockerware they're

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
an international collaboration between

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
security companies the

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
national domestic

127
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
abuse survivors networks

128
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
digital rights advocacy groups and law

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
enforcement in fact we ended up joining

130
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
the coalition against soccerware so that

131
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
we could also help in this problem

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,560
we took a snapshot of the stl

133
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
and looked at

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
the stalker apps that were found between

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
july 14 of 2020 and november 3rd of 2021

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
we were able to identify 6439

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
android applications in this in the stl

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,120
and then we ran these apps through

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
different d compilers

140
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,120
we originally used jdx but we found that

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,240
733 of these apps could not be

142
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
decompiled by it

143
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
we did finally use jeb pro on those 733

144
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,000
it's known for helping with the

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
obfuscation

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,919
um and we were then able to decompile

147
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
another 726.

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
in the end we were able to

149
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,120
decompile overall

150
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,360
6432 of the android apks missing only 77

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
of the original 6439

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
we found that in both cases of apps

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,080
being decompiled by jdx and jeb pro they

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
revealed all of the same markers for

155
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,400
monetization data that

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,080
we were using in our research

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
so with those these apps and apks that

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
we had decompiled we first ran an

159
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
analysis of ad libraries on them

160
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
we found that over one in four of the

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,360
apps in the corpus used ad libraries we

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,639
thought that would be a rather large

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,160
number

164
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
from that number of roughly 1700 apps

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,440
almost 1500 of them only use a single ad

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
provider in their entire app they only

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,160
relied on a single ad provider to

168
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
generate all of their revenue

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,600
and all but 11 of those four

170
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,880
1479 apps used google admobs

171
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,000
this seemed rather drastic and in fact

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
it appears that by cutting off google

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
admob's ad services to the software apps

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
we're removing almost one in four of

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
the apps in the corpus this ability to

176
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,160
generate revenue through ad libraries

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
we also wanted to know

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
is this behavior

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
unique to stalkerware or is this how all

180
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
apps work with ad libraries do they

181
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
mainly use a single ad library and do

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,880
they mainly rely on google admobs

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,400
to do this we compiled 442 samples of

184
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
benign or what we would call benign apps

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
from the google play store's top 500 app

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,599
list

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,400
we then randomly sampled 250 apps from

188
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
both our benign group and our malicious

189
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
group of software apps

190
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,479
we found that the behavior of using only

191
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,680
a single ad library was um was mainly a

192
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
thing for stalkerware soccerware almost

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
did this 90 of the time but in the case

194
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,919
of normal apps or benign apps this was

195
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
under 40

196
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
it was much more common for benign apps

197
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
to rely on multiple ad libraries at a

198
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
time to serve their ads and in some

199
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
cases relied on up to 22 ad libraries to

200
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,680
generate their ad revenue

201
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,039
furthermore we found that even when they

202
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,440
only relied on a single ad library it

203
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
was much less common for them to solely

204
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
lie on admobs

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
in fact it was much more common to see a

206
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,919
wide or

207
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
see other ad libraries used in a much

208
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,120
more higher number

209
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,199
next we wanted to look at in-app

210
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
purchases

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
we identified payment processors

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
supported by the apps by using keywords

213
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
and we created this keyword list by

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
looking at different papers that had

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
been

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,559
that have been highly looked at

217
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,479
and supported in our

218
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
in our industry we use this keyword

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
analysis to identify behaviors of the

220
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,519
apps in fact as well

221
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,360
words like subscription obviously gave

222
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
us an idea that these apps

223
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,560
were on using a subscription basis

224
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
what we call ibs in these graphs refers

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
to in-app billing services

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
internet billing services in fact can

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,800
only be used when these apps are

228
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
currently on the google play store so

229
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
this gave us an idea of what versions of

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
the same apps were on the play store

231
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
and what version these apps were not

232
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
finally we looked at payment processors

233
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
like paypal square and also credit cards

234
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
like visa amex a mastercard

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
but we also wanted to see since these

236
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
are malicious apps if it was rather

237
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
common for cryptocurrency to be used in

238
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
these apps

239
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
and we looked at these between the

240
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,519
different versions of their apps and you

241
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
can see that

242
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
different versions did have different

243
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
behavior in the case of how their

244
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
payment processors were identified or

245
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,839
were being used

246
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,360
and we wanted to compare between these

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
versions of the same app so that we

248
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
could see how they changed their time

249
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
and we've finally settled on target sdk

250
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,680
versions as a way to view this change

251
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
over time

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
we're going to see how these payment

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
processors and behaviors really shifted

254
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
as different things occurred well in

255
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,440
that while target sdk version is not a

256
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
specific or not an exact time

257
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,079
period when these apps would have been

258
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,120
running

259
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,640
it does give us a good idea on

260
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,959
relatively how things changed across a

261
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,440
period of time

262
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
finally with all this data we wanted to

263
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,519
see how the revenue generation changed

264
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
over time in the ecosystem and how is

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
affected by different changes like

266
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
google's tos change

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,399
as of october 2020 stalker web can

268
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
explicitly prohibited from any of

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,720
google's services including the play

270
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
store and google admobs which we saw be

271
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
very prevalent in this dockerware apps

272
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
and they all and they decided to rely

273
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
heavily on this google admobs across

274
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
these software apps

275
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
to look closer at this graph

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,000
or to look closer at this in our

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
longitudinal study of the tos change we

278
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
identified apps that we knew had to have

279
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
been on the play store at some time we

280
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,560
were able to do this by using the iabs

281
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,360
or in-app billing services keyword in

282
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
these apps

283
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,839
we looked at the apps that were

284
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
identified before the tos change of

285
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
october 2020 and after the tos change of

286
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
october 2020

287
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
and identified that if any of their

288
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
versions of their apps had used in-app

289
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
billing services they had been on the

290
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,079
play store at some time

291
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,320
therefore using our keywords for

292
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
behavior we were i didn't able to

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
identify

294
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,399
if they had been taken off the buildings

295
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
if they had been taken off the google

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
play store as in they stopped using the

297
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,959
in-app billing services keyword after

298
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,360
october 20 or if they were still on the

299
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,839
play store or if they were able and to

300
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,760
see how this affected the overall

301
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
monetization change

302
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,639
overall

303
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
the changes vary between keywords

304
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,000
however you do see a change in these

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,279
keywords for every single keyword before

306
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
and after the tos change we see a in

307
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,519
most cases a drastic drop some say

308
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,240
relatively the same like mastercard but

309
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
we do see that looking at in-app billing

310
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
services and even cross-referencing it

311
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
to the actual play store currently

312
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
stockwear overall has been taken off the

313
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,720
play store by a large proportion

314
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,639
however we do see an increase in the

315
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
subscription keyword and therefore we

316
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
know that the use of subscription bases

317
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
in these apps has increased after the

318
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
tos change

319
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
as such we know that it did create some

320
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
change in the ecosystem however from our

321
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,160
research we found that the ecosystem of

322
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,639
stalkerware is largely different from

323
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,720
other papers that have been done

324
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
on looking at the monetization of

325
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,959
different of different types of groups

326
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,240
lovacinski's in

327
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
ieee

328
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
of 2007

329
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
showed that

330
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
spam overlies similar or relies solely

331
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
on only three different banking systems

332
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
on their click trajectories paper but

333
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
stalkerware is a much more decentralized

334
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,320
system so we can't default back into

335
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,519
what they did to correct this problem

336
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,120
in fact we instead recommend that um

337
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
that attacking the monetization network

338
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
for software needs to be multi-pronged

339
