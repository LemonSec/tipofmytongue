1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,460
so I'm John skank I am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,099
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about putting postponed or</font>

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,929
cryptography into tour we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,849
of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool new proposals for systems</font>

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,039
I haven't heard a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people using</font>

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:16,840
post quantum cryptography so rather than

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">start out by introducing tour which you</font>

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,240
all know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start out trying</font>

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,849
to motivate why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might think about</font>

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,520
quantum adversaries today so here's a

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,890
little historical context this is a

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,539
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> from 1932 it's an interesting</font>

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,240
computer because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was built by Derek</font>

14
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,739
layman it's a factoring machine and it

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,039
was the fastest factoring machine until

16
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:38,890
well into the 1960s this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantum</font>

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,980
mechanical calculator from 2014 it

18
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,030
doesn't do much yet but it does do

19
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,409
something interesting if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

20
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,089
title<font color="#E5E5E5"> their superconducting quantum</font>

21
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,530
circuits at the surface code threshold

22
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,568
for fault tolerance what they're saying

23
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that if they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build more of</font>

24
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:53,499
these qubits at the same quality that

25
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,788
they do right now then they would

26
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:56,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make arbitrarily</font>

27
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,049
large quantum computers which is a

28
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit scary although the picture is</font>

29
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:02,799
a little misleading because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

30
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,410
the little part in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that innermost box</font>

31
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,840
right there and there's so much

32
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,460
classical circuitry so much microwave

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,080
electronics outside that's what's

34
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,360
preventing us from building large

35
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,240
quantum computers right now there's a

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,820
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> dotted thing there that's for the</font>

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,339
other four cubits so that's multiplied a

38
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,660
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's really what's</font>

39
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,160
stopping us from having big quantum

40
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,770
computers right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the quality</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quantum hardware I think we</font>

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried about that so I want</font>

43
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that quantum computers are a real</font>

should<font color="#CCCCCC"> start deploying post quantum</font>

48
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,690
cryptography soon and we should do that

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">alongside the crypto they were using</font>

00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,600
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why should we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

51
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,940
hybridization of using say e<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdh end a</font>

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,300
post quantum key exchange well there's a

53
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:01,270
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons we first might have low</font>

54
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,370
confidence in the new schemes maybe

55
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,190
somebody wakes up tomorrow and breaks

56
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,360
all idea lattice cryptography but what

57
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,079
we should really be concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,520
that we have

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,540
confidence in the implementations of

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,690
these new schemes we don't have much

61
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

62
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,170
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to rely entirely on any of</font>

63
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,720
these new post quantum things yet we

64
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,179
have good classical crypto pre quantum

65
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,580
crypto we should use it another concern

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,830
maybe not relevant for tour but some

67
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,380
users do need things like phipps 140

68
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,700
compliance and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to keep using</font>

69
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,190
the things that are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> touch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

70
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,170
important so if we're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

71
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,510
quantum adversaries we need to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,609
think about three different types of

73
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,100
security that we could have we can have

74
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,170
pre quantum security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,459
entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the context of establishing</font>

76
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,170
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel we could have pre quantum</font>

77
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,760
security meaning we have pre quantum

78
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,250
authentication and pre quantum

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,570
confidentiality so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine as long</font>

80
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,070
as you don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there will ever be a</font>

81
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,019
quantum computer but I think there will

82
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,790
be so what you might want instead is

83
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,170
something like transitional security

84
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,609
which is having pre quantum

85
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,799
authentication and post quantum

86
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">confidentiality now authentication is</font>

87
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,610
it's fine to have pre quantum stuff as

88
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,070
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as no one has a quantum computer at</font>

89
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time of session negotiation if they</font>

90
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,370
get one afterwards it would be a problem

91
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the confidentiality that could break</font>

92
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,269
the channel but as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

93
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,190
one when you're negotiating your key

94
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,190
exchange is fine so that's an

95
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,269
interesting use case to consider

96
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,370
adversary<font color="#CCCCCC"> mom's to consider and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

97
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,170
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go all the way to true postponed</font>

98
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,060
in cryptography you could use post

99
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,890
quantum authentication and

100
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,690
confidentiality what I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on</font>

101
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case and in particular I want to</font>

102
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on putting something into tour to</font>

103
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,620
get transitional security so that yeah

104
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,120
real forward secrecy we say we have

105
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,650
perfect forward secrecy it's not really

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,360
true there's an expiration date on

107
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,970
forward secrecy and it's exactly when

108
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,080
you get large quantum computers someone

109
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,580
harvesting ciphertext at the at the

110
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,170
entry node would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just bore</font>

111
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,910
through all the layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption to</font>

112
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,160
break the anonymity and the secrecy of

113
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the channel so we should be concerned</font>

114
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,930
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so what we're going to do</font>

115
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,880
is put a post quantum key exchange

116
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,700
mechanism our key encapsulation

117
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,950
mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the nth or handshake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

118
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,200
so

119
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,798
and towards a one-way authenticated key

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,570
exchange is published in 2013 there's an

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,060
engineering specification tour proposal

122
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,719
to 16 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been deployed since 2013</font>

123
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,580
as well it looks kind of like this so

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,100
there's three phases we can break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

125
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,169
into negotiating the pre-master secret

126
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,450
then doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> authentication tag and</font>

127
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,010
then finally deriving a key so in the

128
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,710
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage getting a pre-master secret</font>

129
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,360
that's two different handshakes one of

130
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,250
them is a static ephemeral and the other

131
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,460
one is ephemeral ephemeral so our

132
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,590
anonymous client generates a ephemeral

133
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,539
diffie-hellman key call that X the

134
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,580
lowercase letters are secret values and

135
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,800
the uppercase letters are public values

136
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,800
so they send their public value over to

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,440
the router in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's server</font>

138
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,290
which has a long-term difficulty which

139
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's note by a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the server generates</font>

140
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,479
its own ephemeral diffie-hellman key<font color="#CCCCCC"> y</font>

141
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,770
and computes the two does to group

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,080
operations it does X to the little Y and

143
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,150
X is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little a so the the one using a</font>

144
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,840
provides authentication and the one

145
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:23,429
using y is going to be used for forward

146
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,859
secrecy they send<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y back and the client</font>

147
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,520
is able to do the same group operations

148
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,050
using their key<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that's the</font>

149
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,139
pre-master secret then we do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

150
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,820
with getting the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication tag</font>

151
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for some more protocol level</font>

152
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,659
attacks you want to bind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that's</font>

153
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,130
derived to the entire transcript you

154
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,770
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you have a</font>

155
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,389
version identifier in there to prevent

156
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,580
cross version attacks and things like

157
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,860
that I won't talk too much about that's

158
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:55,500
just yet and then the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> step is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

159
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:57,720
actually derive a key<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n Tory's got</font>

160
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,340
a proof of security and a totally fine

161
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,479
model but in order to talk about quantum

162
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,090
adversaries I want to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

163
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,979
slightly stronger security model one in

164
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,810
particular that separates everything

165
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,940
that happens before the clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept</font>

166
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,099
and start using the key and everything

167
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,169
that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that so I want to be</font>

168
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,520
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a pre quantum</font>

169
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,130
adversary during that pre<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept phase</font>

170
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,359
in a post quantum adversary post<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

171
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:25,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's this all indoor thing so</font>

172
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,590
to find a variant of n tour that just

173
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes it easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give a proof in this</font>

174
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,419
particular model the model is called the

175
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,860
authenticated and confidential Channel

176
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,380
establishment model that's been used

177
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,320
very successfully to prove the security

178
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,030
of some cipher suites as they're

179
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
deployed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

180
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,638
kind of motivation for why to use it

181
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,650
here to end towards already this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

182
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,210
that's out there why not use this thing

183
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,919
that has a proven track record of being

184
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:55,099
good in that scenario so hybrid null is

185
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">end tour with a few modifications plus</font>

186
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,610
nothing it's just it's just n tour with

187
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,860
a few modifications i took the no means

188
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,910
and that's going to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a</font>

189
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,930
pre quantum<font color="#CCCCCC"> acce protocol or rather the</font>

190
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,930
proof is in the paper and you can go

191
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,430
look at if you want so we have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

192
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,520
few changes in order to get the proof to

193
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:17,840
go through the first is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,820
hatch the static ephemeral share it's

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,250
just a slight different slightly

196
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,900
different assumption hash diffie-hellman

197
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus a gap diffie-hellman assumption</font>

198
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,789
it's not terribly important but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

199
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing to do it</font>

200
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:36,159
prevents some very theoretical attacks

201
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:39,979
against very bad key derivation function

202
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,070
the next thing is that n tour as it's

203
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:45,409
deployed does something a little funny

204
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,240
with with H max so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument to</font>

205
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,400
H Mac here is supposed to be a key<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

206
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,620
the second one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so n</font>

207
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,450
tour is using a fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> H matki for all</font>

208
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,360
sessions and that's fine as long as you

209
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:59,030
treat H Mac as a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle but I</font>

210
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to rely on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that H Mac is a</font>

211
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,719
pseudo-random function family so I'm

212
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,060
just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the public transcript</font>

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,580
stuff and shove it over into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

214
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,590
side of H Mac and use it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

215
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,419
instead again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

216
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,859
provable security thing it's fine to

217
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,870
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac is a random Oracle</font>

218
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,300
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any problems with n tour but I</font>

219
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to rely on the PRF property instead</font>

220
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,240
for the proof and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing is</font>

221
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,669
we're really it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same same issue in</font>

222
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,530
the key derivation step just want to use

223
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,919
H Mac as its intended to be used as a

224
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,630
pseudo-random function<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so that gives</font>

225
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,400
us this protocol hybrid<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it looks</font>

226
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,039
pretty much exactly the same as n tour

227
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,819
is a little

228
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,958
simpler there is one interesting thing

229
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,159
which we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the paper which</font>

230
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,279
is that we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same sort of</font>

231
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:49,339
random key for the earth tag end for the

232
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:52,380
key there's a attack if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,899
sizes of your symmetric functions very

234
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,300
poorly but as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're targeting</font>

235
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,850
say 128-bit security as we are now and

236
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,189
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> symmetric functions that are twice</font>

237
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,360
that size<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're fine and against</font>

238
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,639
quantum adversaries we need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

239
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,829
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> because quantum adversary is get</font>

00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:12,509
a square<font color="#CCCCCC"> root speed up against brute</font>

241
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:13,888

242
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,269
null I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same</font>

243
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,430
protocol I've just made room so I can

244
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:21,000
add some new things I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

245
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,739
adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key encapsulation mechanism to</font>

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,540
this a post quantum key encapsulation

247
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,470
mechanism ideally so that we get this

248
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,420
transitional security property so all we

249
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really the most obvious</font>

250
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,389
thing that you could do anyone in this

251
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,759
room could have come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it you just</font>

252
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,319
you just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a post quantum game</font>

253
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,130
capsulation mechanism in parallel with

254
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:44,279
the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> handshake so the anonymous</font>

255
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,260
client generates public/private key for

256
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,610
some post quantum key encapsulation

257
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,339
mechanism they send their public key

258
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,190
over to the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server encrypts</font>

259
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:56,069
some random value to them and sends a

260
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,930
cipher text back that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a few</font>

261
00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:00,360
extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in the authentication tags</font>

262
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,000
you do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to contain the entire</font>

263
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:08,699
transcript of the session so that's

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,139
hybrid chem talk about some performance

265
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:15,620
soft with hybrid chem this is an

266
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:22,170
instantiation with n true EES 443 ep<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

267
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:23,519
it's a 128-bit post quantum public key

268
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,680
encryption scheme so it actually has the

269
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,040
CCA to property instead of the cpa

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,829
property some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> choose very</font>

271
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,089
different security estimates won't be a

272
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,979
lot more conservative and deploying

273
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,360
thing so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is kind of</font>

274
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,529
right at the heart when<font color="#CCCCCC"> t 8 bit level</font>

275
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we want to be more conservative</font>

276
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,389
than this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

277
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,209
start with this is just a reference

278
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,639
implementation of that parameter set so

279
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> times here are pretty bad but you</font>

280
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,160
can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

281
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:58,170
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot of extra communication</font>

282
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,569
costs and the times for the client key

283
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,010
gen is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing that's really</font>

284
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:05,220
substantially more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> nth or the other</font>

285
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,170
two excuse me the other two protocols

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,830
your tap is the the legacy tour

287

290
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:24,170

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">check it canta is another post quantum</font>

292
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,849
proposal for tour it's specifically a

293
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,620
ring lwe proposal we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

294
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,200
modular thing so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people could try</font>

295
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,380
out different post quantum<font color="#CCCCCC"> chems and not</font>

296
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,630
pick winners at this stage since we

297
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really know it's so very rapidly</font>

298
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,500
changing field don't know exactly what

299
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,960
people want to deploy whether we want to

300
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimize for size or efficiency or</font>

301
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:54,060
exactly what it's going to be so yeah so

302
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,870
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> performance some other</font>

303
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,780
considerations so so right now tour only

304
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,780
alleged have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 505 bites in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create</font>

305
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,150
cell and post quantum keys and cipher

306
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,970
texts are generally pretty large so

307
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,000
looking across here s idh with that

308
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,270
enormous prime number is the super

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,010
singular I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sajni diffie-hellman has been</font>

310
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,460
getting a lot of attention recently it

311
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:23,370
has pretty good sizes it looks nice and

312
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,670
small but still that's over that 505

313
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,550
bike limit entry es 443 that's the one

314
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,349
that we we wrote our implementation with

315
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,079
600 something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bites you know none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

316
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,450
these things are going to fit

317
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,390
fortunately there's a new proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

318
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,130
would allow for larger create cells so

319
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,560
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the near future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

320
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:48,870
possible to deploy some kind of post

321
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:52,439
quantum chem on production toward a few

322
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:55,260
other things it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really nice to</font>

323
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,400
consider multi cipher suite security so

324
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay to reuse this a component the</font>

325
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,579
the servers

326
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term secret across multiple cipher</font>

327
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Suites so say with n tour or with hybrid</font>

328
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,969
null or with hybrid and true or whatever

329
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,340
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using it's probably is</font>

330
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,050
almost certainly fine to do we just

331
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't complicate our security model to</font>

332
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,750
prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that another thing would be one</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> n tour Matt that notion they use</font>

336
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,410
some features of the authenticating key

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:38,870
exchange model that to define the notion

338
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,110
of one-way anonymity since we changed

339
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:44,120
models we can't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same notion but</font>

340
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,220

341
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,630
introducing multiple cipher Suites

342
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,470
that's obviously going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an impact</font>

343
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">on anonymity so really what we need is</font>

344
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,300
something that can do multi cipher suite

345
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,040
security and talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-way</font>

346
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,410
anonymity at the same time if you have

347
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,230
people using different key exchanges or

348
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,280
reducing the anonymity sets so that's

349
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,180
that's a good area for future research

350
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,750
another thing we could think about is

351
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,760
actually deploying a totally post

352
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,520
quantum solution so getting some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

353
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,069
post quantum authentication in there may

354
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,949
be using one of these these new hash

355
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:27,230
based signature schemes in the

356
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:30,110
directories to distribute long-term chem

357
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,750
keys for the server and then the last

358
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,570
thing is that the type of symmetric

359
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,870
crypto that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently uses I needs a</font>

360
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,300
is 128 in CTR mode so what's currently

361
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,560
is in tour isn't good enough for our

362
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,949
proof we assume you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some kind of</font>

363
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,719
authenticated encryption so there are

364
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">some proposals to upgrade the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

365
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,300
symmetric crypto that's being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

366
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,790
tour so something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't need</font>

367
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,699
to be done before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get the</font>

368
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,750
guarantees from our proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

369
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,810
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
