00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,880
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all an example of online</font>

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,410
tracking with cookies and cookies are

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
these small tokens that can uniquely

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,369
identify a web browser across sessions

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,279
and they're used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> many things</font>

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,140
including tracking users and so how they

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,149
work is when a user loads a web page

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,710
from a web server like a news website

15
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,200
the server tells the web browser to

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,770
remember a certain piece of information

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,140
like their user ID so later when you

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,660
request a different page from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,239
domain the web browser includes this

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,980
piece of information with your user ID

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,250
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of first-party</font>

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,930
tracking and here the first party can

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,820
use this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that you're logged</font>

24
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,350
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also about your habits like what</font>

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,769
you've looked at or search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for in the</font>

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">past and it can use this to content</font>

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,200
target / to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,850
talk about third-party tracking

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party requests are requests two</font>

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,979
domains a user did not explicitly

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,990
request and so here the first party web

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,390
page can have content from many

33
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,570
different places like for example it

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,950
might contain an ad an advertiser so

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,929
when the web browser loads this page

36
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,970
it'll send along any cookies that it has

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,570
for the advertiser<font color="#E5E5E5"> and loads that ad</font>

38
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,030
from that third party and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this allows</font>

39
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,100
the 3rd party advertiser to know when

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,570
you visit any page it has content for

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that third party and the third party</font>

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,479
could also be a third party on multiple

43
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,220
different first party websites so in

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,079
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the third party may know more</font>

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,670
about you than any individual first part

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,500
so proponents will claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

47
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,570
practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used for targeting</font>

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,670
advertisements customizing web page

49
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,460
content so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things that</font>

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,720
users or industry actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and find</font>

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,758
value in they also say that the revenue

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,020
that is derived from this practice is

53
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,040
used to provide free services online

54
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,000
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> critics will say that this</font>

55
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,829
raises some privacy concerns so these

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,210
third parties can build very detailed

57
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:29,890
profiles about users and this can

58
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,890
largely happen without users knowledge

59
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,950
so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw with the experts in the</font>

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">field they're saying now I want to talk</font>

61
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what users think and the reason we</font>

62
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,540
want to know what users<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is we want</font>

63
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,180
to understand what specifically users

64
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,730
are comfortable or uncomfortable with so

65
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:53,090
that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve current tool tools</font>

66
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:55,459
to control and limit this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking so</font>

67
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,530
prior work has found in surveys that the

68
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,590
majority of users have serious privacy

69
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,260
concerns the exact figure depends on the

70
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,660
survey and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the survey</font>

71
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,019
however qualitative work found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

72
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,660
users preferences are complex and since

73
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,850
it assists the specifics of situations

74
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,670
and user see both benefits and risks of

75
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,049
tracking depending on the situation so

76
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,190
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when a user is shopping for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a household goods they may have</font>

78
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,070
different concerns about online<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking</font>

79
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,519
than when they're shopping for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a car</font>

80
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,320
look however<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the prior work in</font>

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,750
this area has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been one with hypothetical</font>

82
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,420
situations and this is not ideal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

83
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,430
few reasons first participants<font color="#CCCCCC"> in these</font>

84
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,859
studies may not have enough context to

85
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,510
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a decision and also what</font>

86
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,390
users say about their comfort in

87
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,769
hypothetical setting is often different

88
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,480
from what they say when faced with a

89
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:49,730
concrete situation and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no not</font>

90
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,079
to work very well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example it's</font>

91
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,959
different to ask how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel about</font>

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,549
tracking on a shopping website compared

93
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to how do you feel about tracking when</font>

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:01,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you were shopping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for heartburn medicine</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday on Amazon</font>

96
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,840
so in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current tools</font>

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,520
it's critical to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> user's preferences</font>

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,610
for tracking in the context of their own

99
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,770
browsing history so part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is</font>

100
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,510
understanding what harms users care

101
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,180
about and what situations they would

102
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,700
prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not or be tracked are to be</font>

103
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,410
tracked and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason this first</font>

104
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is important is that once we</font>

105
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a precise understanding of what</font>

106
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,469
users want or need<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can look at</font>

107
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">current tools to try to understand to</font>

108
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,780
what extent they satisfy users needs and

109
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,640
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have enough information to let</font>

110
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,710
us design new better tools that do a

111
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,240
better job of doing this so the purpose

112
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,239
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work is to see if current tools</font>

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,270
offer controls to allow users to specify

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,800
what they would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tracked so we</font>

115
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,030
use qualitative methods to address

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,890
cities and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a more</font>

117
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,159
accurate and detailed view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,120
affected by hypothetical bias and so we

120
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,430
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exploratory study</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this</font>

issue through qualitative interviews we

122
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,740
conducted 35 in-depth semi-structured

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,870
interviews and collected participants

126
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,580
preferences for real situations we paid

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,989
participants for an interview lasting

128
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,900
one hour and participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> were recruited</font>

130
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,940
participant pool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said we use</font>

132
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,650
participants downloaded a browser add-on

133
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we developed to send us their web</font>

134
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,469
history and so we then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> searched</font>

135
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,450
through their web history and used it to

136
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepare an interview with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a participant</font>

137
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,840
about their own web browsing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

138
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,930
participants had an opportunity to

139
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,190
remove items that they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

140

142
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,870
then we use this to conduct the

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,729
interview so unlike prior work

144
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,430
participants were able to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us how</font>

145
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,080
they felt about what when this really

146
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,790
happened as opposed to reacting to a

147
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,349
completely hypothetical scenario so we

148
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,240
asked participants about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of</font>

149
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">different situations to understand their</font>

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,480
views across different contexts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

151
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,390
asked about both first

152
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,400
and third-party tracking situations from

153
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,710
their browsing history and in addition

154
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,870
to asking about specific situations from

155
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,500
their history we also about also asked

156
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">about their general views on track so</font>

157
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,250
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to walk you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through an example</font>

158
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,810
scenario that we gave to participants so

159
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,700
we would show them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a website and ask</font>

160
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,380
participants one of the benefits of

161
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,520
tracking on this website where the harms

162
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,260
of tracking and whether they were

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,909
overall comfortable with tracking on

164
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,200
this specific site and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyzed</font>

165
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the interviews using qualitative</font>

166
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,219
analysis researchers collaboratively

167
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzed interviews</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then met to develop</font>

168

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,480
coded<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then discuss</font>

170
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,469
differences and then iterated and

171
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,440
independently coated the entire set of

172
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,390
interviews<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

173
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our results and so participants</font>

174
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,919
told us about their perceived outcomes

175
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,080
for tracking for specific situations and

176
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,150
so these were some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these were harmful</font>

177
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,250
and some beneficial however we also

178
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,799
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometimes these outcomes were</font>

179
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,510
overtly noticeable to participants and

180
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,540
other times they were more<font color="#E5E5E5"> hidden only</font>

181
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,219
noticeable after reflecting on so in

<font color="#E5E5E5">observed participants have preferences</font>

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,040

191
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,840
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them but interestingly in</font>

192
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,170
many cases participants saw them as

193
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,570
beneficial so telling them about useful

194
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:52,170
products or services I in specific

195
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,760
situations so interestingly some

196
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,040
participants were also concerned about

197
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible legal repercussions for their</font>

198
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,830
browsing history for other situations so

199
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,480
here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of more hidden</font>

200
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,969
outcomes that participants mentioned

201
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,080
notably participants stated in some

202
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,700
cases the driving revenue from this

203
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,820
practice of tracking was harmful and

204
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,409
made them feel used by companies so you

205
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,099
can find more details<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these in the</font>

206
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:22,740
paper so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just saw what range of</font>

207
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,290
outcomes participants perceived we

208
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,000
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in what situations use</font>

209
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,830
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable</font>

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,430
with tracking and part of that is the

211
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:36,140
outcomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that participants perceived but</font>

212
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,909
and so interestingly something can be

213
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,860
seen to a participant as beneficial or

214
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,870
harmful depending on the context and

215
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,669
while it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> perceived as beneficial a</font>

216
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,140
practice could be they could be overall

217
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,350
uncomfortable with tracking in that

218
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,449
situation and vice versa so just looking

219
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,910
at the outcomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that participants</font>

220
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">perceive did not determine exactly their</font>

221
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,370
their comfort with the situation overall

222
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,200
unsurprisingly however in when

223
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,050
participants saw more harmful outcomes

224
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,330
they were less comfortable with tracking

225
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,609
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> however also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hidden outcomes</font>

226
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,630
seemed to drive more discomfort from

227
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:15,170
tracking than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moreover outcomes so</font>

228
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,370
what outcomes people perceived wasn't

229
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,870
enough to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us whether they were</font>

230
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,400
overall comfortable with tracking in

231
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,990
that situation so we looked in more

232
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:26,360
detail at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific situations that</font>

233
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,340
they that they we asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to</font>

234
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,580
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine what it was about</font>

235
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,170
particular page visits that people made

236
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,200
them more or less comfortable so we call

237
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,000
these situational factors and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

238
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to go through these in detail</font>

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,740
here but these are a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of</font>

240
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,800
things that participants data<font color="#CCCCCC"> influenced</font>

241
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:50,240
their comfort in specific situations so

242
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,849
we use these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we learned</font>

243
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,010
about participants views to evaluate how

244
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,890
they might see current tools to control

245
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">tracking so we wanted to understand if</font>

246
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,060
they allow participants to limit the

247
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,460
perceived harms of tracking and at the

248
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,609
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time allow participants to derive</font>

249
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,350
some benefits from attracting and we

250
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,400
wanted to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if current tools also</font>

251
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,290
offer controls to selectively limit

252
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,270
tracking based on what participants said

253
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,370
is important step so we looked at a

254
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,470
different tools ranging from plugins

255
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,040
that participated<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would install</font>

256
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,300
in a browser like<font color="#CCCCCC"> adblock or ghost story</font>

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,000
which are represented<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the first two</font>

258
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,459
icons and we also looked at a private

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,360
browsing mode or manually configuring

260
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:37,359
browser settings

261
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,100
so what we found is<font color="#E5E5E5"> while many of the</font>

262
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,170
tools are capable of addressing some of

263
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,830
the harmful outcomes that participants

264
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,510
cared about they're all so bad at<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

265
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,940
allowing the benefits at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time</font>

266
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,490
so here a green check means that it can

267
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,970
limit harmful out effects in some way

268
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,860
but not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not also allow benefits</font>

269
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,930
yellow means that it might or just the

270
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,490
harms and<font color="#E5E5E5"> red that means nothing and so</font>

271
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,729
while many of the tools are capable of

272
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,830
addressing the harmful outcomes they're

273
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,740
bad also allowing the benefits just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

274
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,060
can see you by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of reading on</font>

275
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,160
so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason for this is that</font>

276
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,589
the tools are bad at giving users

277
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,079
selective tracking controls based on the

278
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,480
situation so we examined whether to

279
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,360
current tools can implement users

280
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,110
situational preferences and I don't have

281
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,149
time to describe all of this in detail

282
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,959
but overall we found only a few tools

283
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,790
provide controls for users for more than

284
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a few of the properties that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

285
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:44,510
to users so to briefly summarize our

286
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,489
investigation of the current tools we

287
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,290
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're somewhat adequate at</font>

288
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,900
addressing the perceived harms however

289
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,420
the tools weren't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also allow the</font>

290
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,279
benefits of tracking and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

291
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,699
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because tools do not allow</font>

292
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,870
controls based on the nuances<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

293
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,760
specific situations that matter to users

294
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,240
so based on this more detailed

295
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,800
understanding of users preferences we

296
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,100
think it's possible to build tools that

297
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,439
do better and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

298
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,350
some preliminary<font color="#CCCCCC"> work where we looked at</font>

299
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,940
using machine learning to decide whether

300
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">a user was comfortable with tracking</font>

301
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,950
we're all in a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> page based on</font>

302
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,430
the situation situational factors that

303
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,290
we found mattered to users so at a high

304
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,900
level we use machine learning methods to

305
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,640
classify<font color="#E5E5E5"> web sites according to user's</font>

306
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,100
preferences and we had two<font color="#CCCCCC"> classes</font>

307
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,079
comfortable or uncomfortable derived

308
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,690
from our data set of specific situations

309
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,790
and we experimented with some different

310
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,830
machine learning methods and we found

311
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the best results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for with</font>

312
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,530
but at a boost and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm about to show you</font>

313
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,599
uses those we found that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

314
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,250
tune false negative verse false positive

315
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,920
rate was particularly useful here

316
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,440
because in our scenario a false positive

317
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,780
where you predict that tracking is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

318
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,340
and then the user is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not</font>

319
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,360
comfortable is more important than a

320
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,830
than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> false negative so on the x-axis</font>

321
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,380
here you have the percent of bad

322
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,970
tracking allowed and on the y axis we

323
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the percent of good tracking that</font>

324
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,020
would be allowed and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ideal tool</font>

325
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,640
would allow all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the good tracking</font>

326
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,150
that users are comfortable with well

327
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,390
disallowing all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the patent tracking</font>

328
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:29,120
so here's how we do in it in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font>

329
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:32,780
we do fairly well in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases taking</font>

330
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,280
out the majority of bad tracking while

331
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,930
allowing some good tracking and while

332
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,270
this clearly isn't anywhere near perfect

333
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,540
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a first look at what machine</font>

334
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,100
learning can do here and so we didn't

335
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the quantities of data that you'd</font>

336
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,520
really want for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of experiment</font>

337
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,100
and we still think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this could work</font>

338
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,420
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the current way current</font>

339
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,640
tools do this so in summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

340
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,770
understand users preferences for online

341
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,210
tracking and to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we conducted</font>

342
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,980
interviews in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of their own</font>

343
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,510
browsing history and by doing this we

344
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,880
gained a better understanding of users

345
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,950
preferences evaluated current tools to

346
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,689
control attractive we also showed

347
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,560
there's some hope for this automated

348
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,770
preference enforceable so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

349
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,770
much
