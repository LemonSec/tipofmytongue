1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,629
well thank you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so much</font>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,210
everyone as you heard it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my work</font>

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,940
but I try to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> my best so please</font>

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,059
forgive<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that happens in between</font>

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,680
but so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing with this actually</font>

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,448
I was lucky because I tell oh I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,100
talk so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much about like privacy and</font>

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,619
genome but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> jean-pierre today</font>

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,570
morning took care of the job for me so I

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,109
don't think I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend too much</font>

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,570
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the necessity for privacy</font>

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,660
preserving considerations when it comes

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,309
to genomic data but these two folks that

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,559
I know chose this particular type of

15
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,610
computation and then said okay well

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,570
there's so much that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do with</font>

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">genomic data let's focus on only a very</font>

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,280
limited number of type of computation

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,770
particular they chose non medical

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,770
related competition medical statement

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,730
things that are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really related to</font>

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,879
diagnostic so they chose ancestry test

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,658
paternity test and genomic compatibility

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,158
test and so ancestry tells the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,720
like add two people want to figure out

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,000
what that they're somehow related or not

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,250
a paternity you know you might have seen

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you especially which I'm making TV</font>

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,090
shows you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's like the test</font>

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you're not the father you know</font>

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,170
and then the guy jumps up and starts

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,390
dancing and and genomic test is like

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,009
basic genetic compatibility is basically

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">ice and Bob are like have been dating</font>

35
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time they're ready to take</font>

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,369
the next step but they want to meet

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,930
since they're very educated they want to

38
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,759
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the child or children</font>

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,340
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have any</font>

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,930
disease so they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run some contact</font>

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,970
compatibility to figure out that they

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have any disease so these are the</font>

43
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:52,350
computations that are the focus of this

44
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,000
paper was about right so now the idea is

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">like as I have been talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,350
know insecure computation you usually

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,509
divided into two categories to part ii

48
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,640
multiplayer party right<font color="#CCCCCC"> well my party is</font>

49
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,070
easy you know is easier i should say

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,899
because you jump immediately you drive

51
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,149
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret sharing and so talking about</font>

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret sharing verifiable secret sharing</font>

53
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,930
and try to do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things that we</font>

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,060
a lot and we had chermont earlier right

55
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,800
to party well things are slightly

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,660
different here to party is better

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,820
because as I have been saying Alice and

58
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,130
Bob so it makes sense to focus on to

59
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,810
party the only thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that to be</font>

60
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,299
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this paper they decided to</font>

61
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,610
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server like just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw what was</font>

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,710
that was talking about somewhere there

63
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,570
right so the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

64
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,320
right so it's a survey the two-party

65
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,630
computation and now the assumption here

66
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,609
that I'm making is that at least one of

67
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">these parties</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite weak right</font>

68
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,040
computation boys and communication wise

69
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,350
let's say Alice she doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate too much you know and so you</font>

71
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,040
when you're trying to come up with a

72
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,390
solution you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,290
know you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting too much burden</font>

74
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,299
on at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them right and you</font>

75
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,260
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage the server the</font>

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">adat server as much as you can write</font>

77
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,950
like okay I guess I can skip all of

78
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,519
these things I'm Pierce edits neeps and

79
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,440
what they are you know what the

80
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,280
particular type of alphabets that they

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,230
come from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> str czar</font>

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,680
something different these are usually

83
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">used for a paternity test right so STRs</font>

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:34,500
are basically a list of tuples and in if

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,950
I'm if I'm your child<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each top oh I</font>

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,650
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those to disappear</font>

87
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,600
one of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two that you have I should</font>

88
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,280
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at right that's because one comes</font>

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,880
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one comes from father right</font>

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:54,830
and so and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I don't know what</font>

91
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:56,880
this dr stands for something reckon so

92
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,380
ancestry what you're trying to do you're

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,630
trying to compare two snips and and

94
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,310
figure out the intersection right and if

95
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,290
there is bigger than something<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

96
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys to close here we are</font>

97
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,570
related somehow right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paterniti as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

98
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">said you try to look at this to yours</font>

99
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,630
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well there should be</font>

100
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,899
intersection for each pair and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

101
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,969
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all pairs then you know that</font>

102
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">guy is your father or mother</font>

103
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,600
and compatibility test basically there

104
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,110
are different type of combat metals<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,740
suggested or offered by folks at the

106
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,840
genomic area field and it but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

107
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:46,020
of it is either you go the approach of

108
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,030
st ours or else names right so you can

109
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,460
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about privacy preserving</font>

110
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,500
computation without bringing up your

111
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,320
security model right that's the first

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,720
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to do so these guys</font>

113
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,430
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I care what is our model amen</font>

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,530
when you define your model you have to

115
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,830
spend a good time justifying it right so

116
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,109
why I chose this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mud somebody here was</font>

117
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,630
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two different types of</font>

118
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,620
adversary's semi honest and malicious

119
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,180
right stop thank you is the advantage of

120
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,750
going last is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone else talks</font>

121
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,630
anticipation so send me honest the idea

122
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,060
as a subset is basically the adversary's

123
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,190
are going to execute the portico I just

124
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,140
said very quickly right and they don't

125
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,810
deviate malicious they can deviate they

126
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,400
can do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to do and</font>

127
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,990
they can actually they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,370
provide the inputs that are supposed to

129
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,710
do right so that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big deal</font>

130
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,390
so think about it the inputs could be

131
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,940
anything they can do whatever they want

132
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,820
so they're up to up to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

133
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,850
they can do tampering with the input and

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,960
and these guys said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay for our</font>

135
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">prayer / our computations we try to</font>

136
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,270
justify our choices in the ancestry test

137
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,570
they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose semi honest for</font>

138
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,570
the Addison Bob right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

139
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,040
that you know there are relatives so

140
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are not enemies to each other and</font>

141
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,660
that's how they justify they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

142
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are going to say that most</font>

143
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">likely they just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

144
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,440
whether there are truly relatives or

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,750
neither have good intentions Paterniti I

146
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,800
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about much about it</font>

147
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,800
malicious right

148
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,250
yeah if you watch the shows that dance

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,130
when they hear that they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

150
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,870
father that's that explains that no they

151
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,830
want to basically change the result

152
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,480
right in their own benefits right and

153
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,530
competitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> compatibility for disease so</font>

154
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,530
if you're passing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to your children</font>

155
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,599
also malicious is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea think</font>

156
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,040
about it because that type of

157
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,620
competition is a computation that can

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,820
reveal information so I can pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

159
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,900
have early signs of Alzheimer to figure

160
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,760
out that whether you have it or not

161
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer comes out to be</font>

162
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is then I know that you have it too so I</font>

163
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,870
can fake my input to basically figure

164
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,760
out something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your team right so</font>

165
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,470
it in this particular type of

166
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,700
application when you come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

167
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,280
you boil it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the genomic</font>

168
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">computation it makes sense that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

169
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,890
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only you have to assume that the</font>

170
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,590
parties are malicious but on top of that

171
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,200
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to assume that they may</font>

172
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,049
actually input or they may change their

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,229
inputs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> temper the inputs right so you</font>

174
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,600
have to have some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of verification</font>

175
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,520
that the inputs are actually proper

176
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:40,660
order there are not done in any

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:43,570
particular badly um so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> where is</font>

178
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,250
the stuff he talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a garbage</font>

179
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,900
stickers but again I quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention it</font>

180
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,490
when you talk about two-party

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,840
computation the first two things or

182
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,310
three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your mind is</font>

183
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,780
one of them is home offering encryption

184
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,640
that usually is expensive is too slow

185
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,260
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is garbled sick</font>

186
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,270
wid all de cabra secure from Yahoo's

187
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,980
time all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> too low and there has</font>

188
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work to improve it and</font>

189
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,520
make it more efficient and all of that

190
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,500
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to very quickly jump over</font>

191
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,849
it because he had a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good slide</font>

192
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,150
there that you know you can represent

193
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,610
your function with boolean<font color="#CCCCCC"> gays and</font>

194
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,469
basically for each wire you can

195
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,820
represent the inputs of the wire with

196
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,770
labels and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> party someone will</font>

197
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,140
generate the horse circuit with all the

198
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,599
labels and someone that guy will be

199
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,419
called a generator and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other guy</font>

200
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,529
will be called evaluator will basically

201
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,810
engage with ever

202
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,448
generator in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computation and says</font>

203
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,149
that ok give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the labels and I will</font>

204
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:41,378
evaluate the function and go down all

205
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,389
the way at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the circle and</font>

206
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:46,959
figure out the labels for the odds would

207
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:48,939
write and that type of computation as

208
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,709
you heard earlier on involves oblivious

209
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:54,248
transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and you must</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard</font>

210
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:55,959
that that is actually costly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal so</font>

211
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:59,860
you want to get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and relies on</font>

212
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:03,550
public key operations and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> less you</font>

213
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,129
do that the better right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

214
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:11,829
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious transfer I think I can</font>

215
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:13,689
skip that right so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go to the</font>

216
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,660
particles that these guys offer or

217
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:18,550
provide these particles number one

218
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,100
ancestry test so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption here is</font>

219
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,529
that Alice and Bob are relative so

220
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,899
they're semi honest now they're using

221
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,910
garbled circles now if you think about

222
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">garble circles there has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been lots of</font>

223
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,949
papers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in garbled circles the</font>

224
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,959
circuit generator has to be most times

225
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,870
it has to be semi honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

226
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,638
evaluator can be malicious I mean you

227
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,990
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it very malicious too</font>

228
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,910
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very complicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

229
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,209
in the journal case the generator can be

230
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,309
semi honest oh and then the evaluator

231
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,199
can be malicious so in this case they

232
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,819
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know what we can</font>

233
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually assume that this folks is from</font>

234
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:56,979
the sky over here the server is actually

235
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,120
malicious so I just pop send me honest

236
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,550
server malicious and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

237
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,589
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol that they came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

238
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,389
the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about this Portugal that</font>

239
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,129
they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand is that this is a</font>

240
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:11,589
garbage secure valuation with no

241
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:14,649
oblivious transfer so it's quite good

242
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,139
but it's very easy in concept so you

243
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,389
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is that one guy let's think</font>

244
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:21,910
about that Bob is a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can spend</font>

245
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:24,579
more time than Alice one guy will

246
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:28,300
generate the circuit in certain sends it

247
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:32,559
to the server and Alice will only send

248
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:36,878
her own the labels are correspond to her

249
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:41,079
own input and send all of that and to to

250
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:43,899
server and cyber fascias the computation

251
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,258
facials are gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> garble Sitka and then</font>

252
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,290
sends

253
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:49,869
outputs and then they've both happily in

254
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,969
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fairway figure out the output right</font>

255
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:54,129
and no obvious transfer quite fast right

256
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,259
but too easy right so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going quickly</font>

257
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the more interesting one when Alice</font>

258
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,799
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob are malicious so since there are</font>

259
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:01,660
malicious they can be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> charge of</font>

260
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,970
generating the circuit so who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

261
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,669
generate the circuit the guy who is semi

262
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,169
honest which in this case survey right

263
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:12,279
so the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate the</font>

264
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:15,249
circuit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

265
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,369
is that Bob is going to jump in and says

266
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:20,619
oh well I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the evaluator</font>

267
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:22,749
and now you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid the oblivious</font>

268
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:25,149
transfer so obvious transfer will come

269
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,829
in and the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious transfer</font>

270
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,889
protocol that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to execute is</font>

271
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:34,358
the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Bob's inputs right and</font>

272
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:36,549
Alice will just pass hair labels to Bob

273
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:40,509
right and now Bob is the evaluator he's

274
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:42,160
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the circuit and then we'll</font>

275
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:44,439
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> to he's going to figure out the</font>

276
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">labels for the output he's going to give</font>

277
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,399
it to Alice all those labels now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice</font>

278
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:50,439
has to figure out that ok these are

279
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,379
actually truly the labels that

280
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:55,329
correspond to the output so she needs to

281
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,039
some sort of verification method and

282
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,008
what she's going to say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone she's</font>

283
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to ask the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server so is that ok</font>

284
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,879
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> something so then I will be</font>

285
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:07,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">satisfied that these are actually truly</font>

286
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:10,389
the outputs right that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

287
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:11,799
generator running the circuit so what

288
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:15,279
the server would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sarah has</font>

289
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:17,350
all the labels will hash the labels for

290
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,989
each wire out with where permute them

291
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,959
send them to Alice and Alice<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just</font>

292
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:25,689
have to do a single simple exact match

293
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,758
of the hash of the labels with the hive

294
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:32,349
with everything that she got from the

295
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:35,249
server right and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take care</font>

296
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,179
of it and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys proved with</font>

297
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:39,100
simulations and everything that why this

298
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:41,199
is securing with respect to malicious

299
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,539
parties and everything now they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

300
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,699
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> they spend a good time and</font>

301
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that initiate was difficult</font>

302
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:50,199
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to understand but to be honest</font>

303
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,959
forgive you confession but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

304
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,179
they so they they go a step further<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

305
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,279
for the compatibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> test they actually</font>

306
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce input verifications right so</font>

307
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,250
in food search

308
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,010
occasion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say right so now here</font>

309
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,380
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rely on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another party the</font>

310
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:08,370
party that like is a trusted party I

311
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:12,160
don't know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NIH or someone that</font>

312
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually issue signatures on the</font>

313
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,079
inputs right from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beats of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the input</font>

314
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,730
tray and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these Alice and Bob will</font>

315
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,380
have the signatures and all they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

316
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,610
do right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the help of zero</font>

317
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,560
knowledge of proof and some sort of your

318
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,710
knowledge proof on commitments they can

319
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the label their</font>

320
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,090
labels that are providing into the

321
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,070
circuits are actually truly correspond

322
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,960
to the inputs that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold the</font>

323
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,360
signature for it signature from a

324
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,310
trusted party right and so then what

325
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,320
they did so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

326
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,239
then they implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> their things right</font>

327
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,810
so they implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the upper</font>

328
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,640
ancestry test and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if i remember</font>

329
00:13:52,810 --> 00:14:03,599
correctly they had I 533 machines Red

330
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:06,010
Hat I five they just used one core and

331
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
they had the very fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> land connection</font>

332
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">between three of them right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

333
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,910
communication delay was negligible right

334
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,770
and for ancestry they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> two to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 17</font>

335
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,469
and snip they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just choose that</font>

336
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,520
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nowhere they look at the genomic</font>

337
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,580
research and they saw that's like a

338
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,590
typical size and they anyway they

339
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,830
implemented and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically this is the</font>

340
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,930
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can see execution column</font>

341
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,940
you know after online you heard about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

342
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll fly you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it separately</font>

343
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,990
locally on lines when parties are

344
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:41,400
interacting with each other and so you

345
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:44,800
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see they are pretty fast right and</font>

346
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,270
communication is basically just the size

347
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,959
of the labels and the circus that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

348
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,579
are sending to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them to the party</font>

349
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then they did that for paternity</font>

350
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests but now it looks patently test has</font>

351
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,050
obvious transfer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one party is</font>

352
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,590
doing it right so that the alice is

353
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,750
completely gone now she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> asleep and</font>

354
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,820
Bob's major the Bob's majority of

355
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,830
computation happens at obvious transfer

356
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,080
so that's the bottleneck right right

357
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,320
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and communication kilobytes so</font>

358
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,110
that's

359
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,880
good right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did for</font>

360
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,220
generally compatibility no they brought

361
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,490
the signatures and zero knowledge proof

362
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:26,830
of knowledge and all these times are I

363
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,240
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in seconds and a millisecond</font>

364
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,420
sorry all these times are milliseconds

365
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the communication units are</font>

366
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:37,540
kilobytes right and so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero time</font>

367
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,040
okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say that at the end of their</font>

368
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,689
paper when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you read it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually</font>

369
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,189
implemented all sort of computation with

370
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,310
the matrix multiplication Hamming

371
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,810
distance a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other things and</font>

372
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,369
anyway the claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that ok we are not</font>

373
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,199
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first people who came up with the</font>

374
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,260
idea of using separate the computation

375
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,850
but they show in their complexity table

376
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,220
that their complexity beats everybody

377
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,340
right and they have the fastest right

378
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,980
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah we can go and read</font>

379
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,980
their paper and easy questions
