00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:08,010
hi I'm riva del Vista from cybernetic ax

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,980
from Estonia and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,309
practical deployment of secure

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,210
multi-party computation technology for

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,609
studying<font color="#E5E5E5"> large-scale data sets and a</font>

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,439
little bit unconventionally I'm going to

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:30,689
start with a figure so here on these

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,570
bars you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the number of ICT</font>

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:40,530
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> in enrolled in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university city</font>

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:42,690
curriculums from 2006 to 2012 and at the

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">same time the orange line shows the</font>

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:53,160
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ICT students who had already</font>

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:58,309
quit their studies by the end of 2012 so

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,989
on average about<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty three percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

15
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,899
students enrolled<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ICT curriculums in</font>

16
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">Estonia during this period had critter</font>

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,220
studies before 2013 already so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

18
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,640
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty students are a lot of voices these</font>

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,200
students are working during their

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,320
studies already and naturally

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">universities play my IT companies</font>

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:29,899
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are employing ICT students</font>

24
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,039
really early on so they are afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,850
students do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time or</font>

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,189
motivation to graduate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> time or</font>

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,600
graduate at all and of course we set out

28
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:47,820
to figure out if this was really the

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,829
case so you can immediately notice that

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,619
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually already have the necessary</font>

31
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,500
data to answer this question<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

32
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,509
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the education records from the</font>

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,649
ministry of education and<font color="#E5E5E5"> research and</font>

34
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:05,310
although we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not have income records</font>

35
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:09,060
for individuals we do have tax records

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,900
and for private persons we can more or

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,230
less deduce their income based on the

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,799
tax data and this data is held by the

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">Estonian tax and customs port so what we</font>

40
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:24,980
can do we can take to do two data sets

41
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:28,430
combine them and then let the

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:32,149
professional data analysis to their work

43
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,760
and answer questions like if and how

44
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:41,599
much working<font color="#CCCCCC"> during the studies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affects</font>

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:44,290
one like graduating on time or or later

46
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,179
career or something like that however

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,790
this is a privacy conference and we all

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,799
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can't actually combine the</font>

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,340
day these data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets into central</font>

50
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:58,639
database like this because both of these

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:02,810
data sets contain private sensitive

52
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:06,909
information which means that this kind

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:10,189
of combining is prohibited by the

54
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:14,750
Personal Data Protection Act or similar

55
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:16,069
legislation and furthermore tax data the

56
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,109
secrecy of tax data is actually

57
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:24,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">protected by the taxation Act and even</font>

58
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:28,579
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow could or would be allowed</font>

59
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:31,489
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> those two data sets in a in one</font>

60
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:33,549
central database to analyze it this

61
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,109
central database would immediately

62
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,470
become a really attractive target for

63
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:42,729
all kind of attackers both attackers

64
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:46,129
from the outside like hackers as well as

65
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:49,159
inside their attackers for example like

66
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:53,448
maybe a little bit too<font color="#CCCCCC"> nosy analysts or</font>

67
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,899
malicious database administrators who by

68
00:03:53,449 --> 00:04:00,199
definition have access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,599
so what we need resolve the problem by

70
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:07,790
employing secure multi-party computation

71
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,988
technology and to be exact we use the

72
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,530
share mine secure multi-party

73
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:17,269
computation platform so on the left left

74
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,899
side we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same input sources the</font>

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">ministry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> education and research and</font>

76
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,669
tax and customs port but in this

77
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,430
scenario they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do not sent there</font>

78
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,490
data sets to the central database what

79
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:35,120
they do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they take each of their</font>

80
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,360
individual values secret charity those

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,790
into random looking pieces and then

82
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,140
distribute those pieces among the free

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:49,400
computation parties in the center so

84
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,500
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the computation parties the</font>

85
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,789
rule of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the free computation part is in</font>

86
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,290
in this deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're played by first</font>

87
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Estonian information system authority</font>

88
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,650
which is a government<font color="#E5E5E5"> institution</font>

89
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:06,320
overseeing and managing all of the state

90
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,159
information systems then the IT

91
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,760
department of the ministry of finance

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,800
which is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually also the IT</font>

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,020
department for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tax and customs port</font>

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,360
which meant that the tax and customs

95
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,200
port actually had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really tight control</font>

96
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,090
throughout this analysis process and

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,260
finally a cybernetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> ax as the</font>

98
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:33,880
technology provider the analysis itself

99
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:36,860
was carried out by professional

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,010
statisticians from the center of Applied

101
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,100
Research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were using statistical</font>

102
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,349
analysis tool called our mind that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

103
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:50,360
will briefly talk about in in a couple

104
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:54,230
of moments so for the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> limits I</font>

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,820
can't get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> much detail here so if</font>

106
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any questions about the</font>

107
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,780
deployment and feel free to find me

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,210
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> or tomorrow anyway to pull this</font>

109
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,219
kind of deployment off there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

110
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,710
of procedures that we had to follow and

111
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,860
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this slide should</font>

112
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:17,380
belong to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> parallelization of human</font>

113
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:20,830
factors actually but here it is so first

114
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,180
before the actual study took place we

115
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:29,450
talked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Estonian Data Protection</font>

116
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:31,220
Authority we introduce them them to the

117
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,800
secure multi-party computation

118
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,310
technology and how we we were going to

119
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,430
use it in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular study and</font>

120
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:43,790
after long<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter</font>

121
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:46,770
discussion they finally concluded that

122
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:50,820
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheering can be taught as a form</font>

123
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,340
of encryption which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

124
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,790
multi-party computation can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tendered</font>

125
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:00,570
as a computation on encrypted data and

126
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,940
since the whole analysis is done using

127
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:07,020
secure multi computation then it means

128
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only analyzing data in</font>

129
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,469
encrypted form so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not</font>

130
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:16,229
processing private information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for</font>

131
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,570
this particular study they concluded

132
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,000
that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not need their</font>

133
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,159
explicit agreement to carry on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,910
study which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a really good</font>

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">result in this context next as the tax</font>

136
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,250
and customs port was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source of the</font>

137
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,370
most sensitive data the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> day time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

138
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,690
this study then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to conduct a</font>

139
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:44,910
code review on the share mind

140
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,030
implementation and this code review was

141
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:51,540
carried out by<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the IT department</font>

142
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:56,210
of Ministry of Finance and they

143
00:07:51,540 --> 00:08:00,740
concluded that share mind is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

144
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:03,810
nicely written piece of software that

145
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,430
that keeps like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best practices of</font>

146
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:13,020
modern software development in mind and

147
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:14,790
finally although we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the technical</font>

148
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,359
measures of secure multi-party

149
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:22,230

time-consuming part of the of the whole

scientists refer to as extract transform

and load and why we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this kind</font>

182
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:15,730
of step is because the input sources

have the data in their operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

190

transformations on the data like

language syntax and same function names

203

however it is important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font>

204
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">that our mind is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a user interface</font>

205
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:29,819
just a command line and all of the

206
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:31,829
operations are actually carried out by

207
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:38,269
the free computation parties using

208
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:41,608
secure computation and our mind includes

209

most of the statistical functionality

210
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:48,389
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would expect like aggregating</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the size of the data itself the study</font>

included students that have graduated

215
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:07,709
between 2006 and 2012 so we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

216
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:10,459
600,000 education records from the

the a bit over<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten million tax records</font>

from the tax and customs port like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">for was actually the hardest part of the</font>

222
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:30,299
whole study so it took quite some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

223
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:35,819
took about three hundred and eighty

hours over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public internet however</font>

225
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:42,929
after the actual study had finished we

226
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:47,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">found some additional bottlenecks in</font>

both the analysis scripts as well as as

the secure multi-party computation

protocols themselves and we optimize

them a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now for for the same</font>

231
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,979
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data and over the public</font>

process in in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six hours and 15</font>

234
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:16,859
minutes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better now</font>

235
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:18,120
and finally here's a little very short

236
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:22,380
overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

237
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,150
of the results that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got so as the</font>

238
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:29,850
dish it does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the station's found</font>

239
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:32,640
that yes truly the nominal graduation

240
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,520
rate of all the curriculums in Estonia

241
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,130
is just about forty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is low</font>

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,010
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are really really bad</font>

243
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,589
for ICT curriculums where this figure is

244
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,430
just about twenty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

245
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:51,390
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad however if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

246
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:54,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure here then on the left side</font>

247
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non nicety curriculums</font>

248
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,779
and on the right side you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the</font>

249
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:03,510
ICT curriculum and the lines show the

250
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:06,750
percentage of working students during

251
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:09,900
first second and third year of their

252
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,150
bachelor studies and there is no way we

253
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,790
can say that ICT students are working

254
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:18,839
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than non nicety students based on</font>

255
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:24,029
those two graphs so the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

256
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">citty students are dropping out more has</font>

257
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be something else or something at</font>

258
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:34,100
least additional to this fact than just

259
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:37,620
working during during their studies and

260
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:41,330
with this result I'd like to conclude so

261
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,330
thank you for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> adventure</font>
