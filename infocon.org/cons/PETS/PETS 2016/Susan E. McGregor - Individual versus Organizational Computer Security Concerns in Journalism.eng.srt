00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,728
thank you very much everyone Thank You

00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:09,340
Angela so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Susie McGregor I'm</font>

3
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:10,600
at Columbia Journalism school and the

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,160
work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> presenting today is</font>

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,870
individual versus organizational

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,670
computer security and privacy concerns

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,400
and journalism which is a bit of a

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,560
mouthful but hopefully we can sort of

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,419
clarify what all that means and this is

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,130
work that I completed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my</font>

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,470
collaborators Francie<font color="#CCCCCC"> rosner and Kelly</font>

12
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kane first I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say thank</font>

13
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,669
you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all to the generous support</font>

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,800
of the National Science Foundation that

15
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,600
made this collaboration possible we are

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,578
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> different institutions across many</font>

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,289
many miles and that's an incredibly

18
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,979
valuable and also to our advisory board

19
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:42,839
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> members of whom are here today we'd</font>

20
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,638
also like to thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> our participants</font>

21
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:49,420
there were close to 30 participants in

22
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:50,829
this study and many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whom you know all</font>

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,620
of whom gave their time very generously

24
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:56,319
and shared really valuable information

25
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,760
with us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of on the</font>

26
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">background and motivation here I think</font>

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">at this point we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

28
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:03,719
journalists are<font color="#E5E5E5"> targets of sort of</font>

29
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,130
privacy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security compromising</font>

30
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,750
attacks but the part that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

31
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,960
highlight here is the fact that actually

32
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,869
we see them targeted in two ways we see

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,240
news organizations as a whole targeted

34
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:17,829
this is some research<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Shane Huntley</font>

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,929
and Morgan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marquis boire presented at</font>

36
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:23,408
black had a couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

37
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,600
suggested that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many as eighty four</font>

38
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,640
percent of the top 25 news sites

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,369
worldwide were the subject of

40
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,009
state-sponsored attacks likewise we see

41
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:34,840
sort of the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack so-called often</font>

42
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:38,109
applied against an individual

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,020
journalists so a couple of primary

44
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:43,359
instances from the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> James</font>

45
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,158
verizon and James Rosen both individual

46
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,928
reporters who were targeted for their

47
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,719
specific work and there are particular

48
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,520
sources and records so you know one of

49
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,199
the motivations here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to say that</font>

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of what this tells us is that there</font>

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,789
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different motivations for the</font>

52
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy and security compromising</font>

53
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,579
instances that these that journalists

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,569
face as organizations and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> individuals</font>

55
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,428
and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know from</font>

56
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:08,350
prior work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that although we have lots</font>

57
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,210
of great tools out there they're

58
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,579
generally not very well adopted by

59
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,920
individual

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">less the organization's the above pie</font>

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,619
chart is from a survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> of members of the</font>

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,480
investigative reporters and editors

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">network which is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worldwide community</font>

64
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">of investigative reporters and editors</font>

65
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">where fifty percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them reported</font>

66
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,820
that they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not use any privacy</font>

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,060
enhancing technologies in their work so

68
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,670
last year we presented some work on the

69
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the security and privacy concerns of</font>

70
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,850
individual journalists and one of the

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,410
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this highlighted to us was</font>

72
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was more going on than just</font>

73
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,799
what individual journalists themselves

74
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,920
were reporting and thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,050
we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this work to kind of</font>

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,720
expand our view and look at a bra a

77
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">bigger piece of the ecosystem right some</font>

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the some of the evidence we had from</font>

79
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,480
that work was that you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

80
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,149
other things influencing journalists

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,109
privacy and security choices beyond

82
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,690
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own kind of beyond their own</font>

83
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,480
preferences<font color="#E5E5E5"> or abilities and so we</font>

84
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,800
expanded this out to include other

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,200
stakeholders that are within the

86
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization's this of course is still</font>

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,040
part part of still a larger ecosystem

88
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,600
around media which also includes things

89
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,820
like sources and readers and we actually

90
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some work in under development</font>

91
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,390
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that addresses these</font>

92
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,519
constituencies and how their

93
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,910
understandings and choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> may play into</font>

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,519
the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security choices of</font>

95
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,650
journalists and journalism so a little

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,230
bit about our study design we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 journalists and seven editors and</font>

98
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven technologists just to give you a</font>

99
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,140
brief delineation of these groups

100
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,870
individual journalists all of these

101
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who work full-time employees at</font>

102
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,940
major or respected news organizations

103
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,030
across a range of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> media types</font>

104
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,390
wire services newspapers you know print

105
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,760
whatever we call that these days you

106
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,070
know multimedia journalist generally

107
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,130
were people who spent most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their time</font>

108
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,959
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources you know reporting</font>

109
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,299
and writing stories or producing stories

110
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,310
in some format editors<font color="#E5E5E5"> were people who</font>

111
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,228
had responsibility for others in the

112
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,280
newsroom and the way we distinguish this

113
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">was primarily around their ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

114
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,070
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only their supervisory</font>

115
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,020
responsibilities but their ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

116
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,169
make a priority to

117
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,430
about others work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means that our</font>

118
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,799
editors were people who had the

119
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,569
opportunity to say make decisions about

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,909
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a story would run at a</font>

121
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,650
particular time whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not a certain</font>

122
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,750
story might be pursued right so they

123
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence over the work of others</font>

124
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,360
in the newsroom technologists were

125
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,128
people who sometimes works specifically

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,810
in an information technology capacity

127
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,150
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we asked them about</font>

128
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,460
which should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not turn up a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

129
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,340
yeses was whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they were</font>

130
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,280
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the sort of privacy and</font>

131
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">security choices of the newsroom whether</font>

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in their mandate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or not but</font>

133
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">these were again people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who tended to</font>

134
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,909
run internal information systems at

135
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,199
these news organizations so the two key

136
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:14,250
takeaways that we have from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,330
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the individual</font>

138
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,889
journalists and organizational

139
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,210
stakeholders you know they're in line on

140
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,340
some things and they differ<font color="#E5E5E5"> in others</font>

141
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,810
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the main</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we'll focus</font>

142
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,669
on here is the ways in which they differ

143
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,110
but also that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their unique</font>

144
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,758
characteristics of the field of

145
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,270
journalism and the way that journalistic

146
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,130
organizations operate that make some of

147
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,889
the more perhaps traditional solutions

148
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,069
for encouraging use of privacy enhancing

149
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,080
technologies or security measures not

150
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,360
not as appropriate with this community

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,370
and that that gives us insight for ways

152
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,449
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might you know suggest ways that</font>

153
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,710
we might move forward and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

154
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,659
address the particular needs of this

155
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,690
community and others communities that

156
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:53,940
are similar or related so on the shared

157
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,000
priorities we found you know several

158
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,289
things basically source protection

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,360
reputational risks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

160
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,340
and competitive advantages we're all

161
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,800
things that came up for across all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

162
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,359
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups so perhaps a little bit</font>

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,279
surprisingly you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologists said you know brand is</font>

165
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,199
really important for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care about</font>

166
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,759
brand integrity this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important</font>

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,610
and of course source protection and so

168
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,659
I've peppered in some quotations here

169
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,520
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're interesting</font>

170
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:23,340
there are many many more in the papers

171
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,419
so i encourage you to to read it if

172
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,310
you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little bit more</font>

173
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,840
depth on this this is an individual

174
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,490
journalists speaking basically saying

175
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,159
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem for me</font>

176
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also my news organization if I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

177
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,099
able to protect my sources and similarly

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,020
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flipside we have an edit</font>

179
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,820
are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've got a pretty</font>

180
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,530
good reputation but it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get blown</font>

181
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,450
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an instant so we have to protect</font>

182
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,099
everyone because otherwise we'll never

183
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:50,900
live it down so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very binary</font>

184
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,880
attitude towards compromise on these

185
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,650
things which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that once a</font>

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,020
reputation is damaged it is extremely

187
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to retrieve and so things like</font>

188
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,359
source protection and the brand image

189
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,890
are extremely high priority they have

190
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">different priorities though and I think</font>

191
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,580
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think this sort of summarizes</font>

192
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,250
one of the huge motivations for this

193
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,780
work we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> several core concerns for</font>

194
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,430
organizational stakeholders that didn't

195
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,469
even make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the radar of individual</font>

196
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,520
journalists<font color="#E5E5E5"> so individual journalists</font>

197
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,890
very concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how they</font>

198
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,840
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with sources didn't even</font>

199
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,630
mention fishing didn't mention password

200
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,619
sharing we had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who said</font>

201
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the security of</font>

202
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,200
third-party applications but otherwise

203
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,210
and then finite resources of course you

204
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,580
know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have in a day to</font>

205
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,419
do what things was very much a concern

206
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,659
for organizational stakeholders so again

207
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,520
just some illustrative quotes here an

208
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of an editor talking about a</font>

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,169
fishing incident that was highly

210
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,370
compromising for this news organization

211
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,530
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

212
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,480
happened more than once and obviously is

213
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,450
an important priority for them on

214
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,730
password sharing one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of</font>

215
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,770
features of these interviews we often

216
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,050
ask people if they could have one thing

217
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:07,130
what would it be if they could magically

218
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,600
have a technology or or a behavior what

219
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,950
would they choose and this was actually

220
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,970
a fairly common one for the

221
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,170
technologists to say password security

222
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,550
both sharing and passwords and the

223
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,150
strength of passwords came up in that

224
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:23,120
respect and and this is an editor

225
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,060
talking about issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

226
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,770
applications right and the common use of

227
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,200
consumer style third-party applications

228
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,580
by journalists but you know as I like

229
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you know if you want to keep your</font>

230
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,650
recipes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that's fine but be</font>

231
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,240
careful and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally finite</font>

232
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,949
resources right i mean i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

233
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,260
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can all relate to but</font>

234
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,700
the issue of management right so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

235
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really important point when we</font>

236
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,670
think about privacy enhancing

237
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,360
technologies and the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the real</font>

238
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost associated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with them right so</font>

239
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,490
a free and open source<font color="#CCCCCC"> software</font>

240
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,200
environment there are responsibilities

241
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,970
that have cost associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so</font>

242
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,110
you know who owns it who's going to pay

243
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,839
for it who's going to pay for the

244
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,430
licenses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> who controls it who has to</font>

245
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
maintain it these were all issues that

246
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,269
were a particular concern to editorial

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
and particularly technical stakeholders

248
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:15,010
right who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support this thing</font>

249
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,480
when when people have problems so you

250
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,890
know in many cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we might</font>

251
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,779
find these are not particularly shocking

252
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,850
many of these are issues that lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

253
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,670
organizations share obviously finite

254
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,910
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> are for example a challenge</font>

255
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,500
across the board but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are again</font>

256
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,519
these unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects about sort of</font>

257
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
journalists and journalistic

258
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,149
organizations that make some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our more</font>

259
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,070
traditional approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe less</font>

260
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:37,480
successful in these cases and and it

261
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,329
really has to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of autonomy</font>

262
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,279
and uniqueness and decentralization as

263
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,339
well as a very significant pure oriented

264
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,079
culture so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original the</font>

265
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:48,550
original graphic that I presented kind

266
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,229
of showed journalists and editors and

267
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,519
technologists as these finite groups and

268
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's a little bit more</font>

269
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,990
intervenes than that journalists and

270
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,370
editors you know one editor will work

271
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,040
with many journalists one journalist

272
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:05,860
will look<font color="#E5E5E5"> will work with many editors</font>

273
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,149
and and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality is that when it</font>

274
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,339
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to journalists individual</font>

275
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,470
journalists<font color="#CCCCCC"> their real value is actually</font>

276
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,180
in the uniqueness of their work and so

277
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,440
editors are often very reluctant to

278
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,630
interfere<font color="#CCCCCC"> with whatever process</font>

279
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,980
journalists have for getting for

280
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,910
creating the work that they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

281
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,380
likewise are also highly decentralized

282
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not like everyone sits in the</font>

283
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">newsroom all day and so here we have an</font>

284
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,410
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of an editor saying</font>

285
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,819
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know who the subject of this</font>

286
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">story is and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to know</font>

287
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if I do that's information that</font>

288
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,980
i can put at risk but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

289
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:41,050
that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

290
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,910
similarly we saw this from technologists

291
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,529
again from a more technology related

292
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,360
perspective having to do with

293
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:47,500
passphrases so this idea even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

294
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,110
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use privacy enhancing</font>

295
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,630
technologies you know how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

296
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,970
manage that within the organization in a

297
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,240
way that's effective and doesn't open us

298
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,100
up to other risks unintentionally and

299
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,509
then here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a sort of</font>

300
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,399
demons from a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of editors that</font>

301
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,329
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of allude to this this very</font>

302
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,500
pure oriented practice so you know i

303
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,239
love the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hedging that goes on in</font>

304
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,350
this first quote they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
services there were a little less

306
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,940
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and maybe a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little more</font>

307
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,110
convenient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's no prohibition</font>

308
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,329
but we sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and say we need you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

309
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,860
understand the risks right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

310
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,540
have another editor saying it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

311
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,759
enforced but not necessarily with

312
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,370
punitive repercussions right so we see a

313
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,680
real reluctance here to say no you must

314
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:34,060
do things a certain way otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

315
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,589
dice so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the insight what can we</font>

316
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,790
learn from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again you know</font>

317
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,920
there's certainly more detail on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

318
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,569
paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we took from</font>

319
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,009
the original work and flushed out here

320
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:44,380
that you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider all</font>

321
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,779
stakeholders right so you know one of

322
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,459
the simplest examples here that we asked

323
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,310
and in most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases the answer was no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

324
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,810
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not was whether or not an</font>

325
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,910
average journalist had administrative

326
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,290
rights on their workstation in the

327
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,649
office and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer in most cases was</font>

328
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,610
no right so at that point if they can't

329
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,589
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can't use privacy</font>

330
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,120
enhancing technologies at all even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

331
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,670
they're incredibly usable if they cannot

332
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,829
install them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so having to</font>

333
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,569
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organizational</font>

334
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,130
stakeholders interests fit in is

335
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,500
necessary if you're ever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

336
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,889
these communities to adopt these

337
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,130
technologies on mass the other thing has

338
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,360
to do with sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of workflows in sort of</font>

339
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,220
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like rallying around</font>

340
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,139
known protocols and tools so if we go

341
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to this graphic you know what we</font>

342
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see is basically I think of it as</font>

343
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,290
sort of a bubbling effect you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

344
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,699
often tech the<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists will come</font>

345
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,949
across sources who say why don't use

346
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:37,508
this that or the other thing but the

347
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,399
reality is that the journalists don't

348
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the expertise to assess individual</font>

349
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,579
selections and the technologists<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

350
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,680
servicing hundreds or sometimes

351
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,180
thousands of individual journalists they

352
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,800
don't have the bandwidth to evaluate

353
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,019
novel protocols and tools all the time

354
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,540
right so the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the solutions we</font>

355
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,860
offer can can rest on things that are

356
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">already known and whose value is</font>

357
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,990
appreciated already the more significant

358
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,939
adoption we're going to see also

359
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,430
multi-party collaboration as I noted

360
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,810
journalists and editors work with lots

361
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,099
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people all the time you</font>

362
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,569
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with a different editor on a</font>

363
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,860
weekday than you will on a weekend if

364
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're running a feature it's going to</font>

365
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,950
be somebody different than if it's a

366
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,360
blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post right so</font>

367
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,890
access issues and the ability to

368
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,080
collaborate especially document level

369
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,000
collaboration is absolutely integral

370
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,130
right so you know there has been some

371
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,480
work on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of content cloaking of you</font>

372
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,000
know collaborative document editing

373
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,070
things like that have a real have real

374
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,180
promise for this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then finally</font>

375
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:34,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to reiterate communication</font>

376
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">is so key and this goes both ways so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

377
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,290
did have a case of one of our

378
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,090
participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know who just said</font>

379
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,780
listen you know we've had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

380
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,950
some risks we've had some incidents and

381
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,350
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story about</font>

382
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this person choosing to finally adopt</font>

383
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,730
two-factor authentication and you know

384
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,530
their experience was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it was</font>

385
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,450
explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them by a party that was</font>

386
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,900
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them who understood their</font>

387
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,340
priorities and the value was clearly

388
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,750
indicated they had no problem there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

389
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,300
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistance whatsoever from the</font>

390
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,010
newsroom but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the side of</font>

391
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,140
technologists need to communicate more

392
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,850
clearly because of course it works the

393
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,699
other way so this is a technologist

394
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,680
talking about you know conceptualizing a

395
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,290
DDoS attack on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and</font>

396
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,900
saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how much is this worth</font>

397
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,400
to you right as a technologist I can

398
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,079
make some I can protect something almost

399
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,209
infinitely but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost a lot</font>

400
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of money how much money is it worth to</font>

401
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,930
keep a story up for two days it's going

402
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to cost a hundred thousand dollars so</font>

403
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,969
it's by no<font color="#CCCCCC"> means a one-way street</font>

404
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,770
finally just to say that this is you

405
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,270
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our in the future we're also</font>

406
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,620
turning towards other communities where

407
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see where we see this applying</font>

408
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,890
right and one of the ones we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

409
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,380
thinking about is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> legal community</font>

410
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,939
and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

411
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevant in those communities as well</font>

412
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,400
this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of our participants who</font>

413
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,990
has worked with lawyers and a lawyer

414
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,670
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a similar issue and saying</font>

415
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'd love to use PGP but I</font>

416
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:00,160
contacted my IT department and they just

417
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,230
won't have any of it so the that's all

418
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,670
I'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to take questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I do</font>

419
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage you to look at the paper</font>

420
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,790
there's a lot more juicy stuff in there

421
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,790
and thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much for your time</font>

422
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,099
you
