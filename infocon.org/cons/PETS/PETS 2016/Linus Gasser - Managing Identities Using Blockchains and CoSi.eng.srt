30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,350
the system components how we set up our

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,000
solution and give a small usage example

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,880
demo and then we'll come to them

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,759
questions so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all want to be secure</font>

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,920
the hero of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is Linus who has a</font>

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,180
no heavier burden than having a great

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential he got very he got very modern</font>

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,880
he has a tablet now and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has an ssh</font>

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,490
key and he has some email key that he

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,220
needs to handle and some laptop and

40
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,539
another pgp key Wi-Fi more ssh-keys more

41
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,240
telephones and poor Linus gets

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,159
completely swamped with all those

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,350
security tokens that he needs to carry

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">around all the time till in the end he</font>

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,619
has to flee so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help Linus to</font>

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
be secure with all these tokens<font color="#CCCCCC"> but most</font>

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these Falcons with the exception of</font>

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,649
the villain passwords have in common

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,559
they have a public and the private part

50
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,360
so we want to look how we can handle

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">these public parts if you have a lot of</font>

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,390
these public keys and protect example of

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,380
the ssh keys so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we manage ssh</font>

54
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,320
keys here

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,660
again he has his laptop and he has a

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,250
server yes to manage he has some github

57
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,880
account of course and he's also using

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,760
each lab all of those they accept SSH

59
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,650
public keys as authentication and the

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,620
most simple way to do is is having just

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,570
one keeper device so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> uses one key for</font>

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,520
the servant the github and for his

63
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,900
tablet he has another key that uses for

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">github and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teacher</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lab now this is not</font>

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,390
so nice because if Lucy his evil sister

66
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,940
manages to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key she is director</font>

67
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,290
of everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can access all</font>

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,420
the devices which are linked to that key

69
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,579
we have some pseudonymity if not not all

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,950
keys are used for all services so if for

71
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,600
example the server gets compromised and

72
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">each lap and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they too they look together</font>

73
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,790
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be able to see that t1 and</font>

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,560
t2 they belong together but if github

75
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,049
and teach loud if they look at their

76
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,630
databases they will see oh it is the

77
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,900
same key for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device in this device</font>

78
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,359
or they will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to link those both</font>

79
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,770
devices to Linus now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit</font>

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,650
different to the talk that has been

81
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,260
given by Aaron at the beginning of the

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,360
week for<font color="#CCCCCC"> her project shatter where she</font>

83
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,630
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distinguish the</font>

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,250
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want not to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to link to</font>

85
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,780
the devices so it's a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a different</font>

86
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,330
approach than what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had in the</font>

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,060
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the advantage of this it's</font>

88
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,610
very easy to manage the keys now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">go a bit further we can say it's better</font>

90
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,770
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one keeper service per device so</font>

91
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,450
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have the laptop one key for the</font>

92
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,000
server one key for github on key for

93
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:55,859
dieter lab the same for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the same</font>

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,620
for the tablet and now if the evil

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,930
sister Lucy comes and if he fetches the

96
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,570
keys she is director of<font color="#E5E5E5"> last because you</font>

97
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,370
can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it to access one service</font>

98
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,190
and not all the other services that

99
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,380
Linus uses and it also gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

100
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,780
pseudonymity because now the server and

101
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,430
get up even if they collude they cannot

102
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,649
find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the keys they belong to</font>

103
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same device or that both devices</font>

104
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:22,260
they belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same user but it gets</font>

105
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">very difficult to manage these keys so</font>

106
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,310
here you only have two devices and three

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,150
services but count the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of devices</font>

108
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,979
you haven't

109
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,388
number of services you use and all of a

110
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,030
sudden if you multiply one by the other

111
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,560
you come to 20 30 40 keys that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

112
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to handle which is kind of</font>

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,580
difficult so as we all learn during this

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,469
week the best thing we can do is we can

115
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,889
solve all our crypto problems with a

116
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,240
trusted third party so the solutions

117
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find on the market so there are</font>

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,110
people already talked about that is just

119
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,210
to have one central authority to hold

120
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,460
all keys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a central authority</font>

121
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,380
we put it in we put all our keys in

122
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:04,169
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're done we go home and we sleep</font>

123
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,120
very well no I don't hear any<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

124
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,159
you should say boo because of course if

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,740
this trusted third party gets

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,260
compromised it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice so if</font>

127
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,080
Lucy gets to be in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> central</font>

128
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,900
authority somewhere inside and add keys

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,740
or exchange keys well that's not very

130
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,919
nice and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get very fast compromised so</font>

131
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,289
with that short start I put up some

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements so to have some</font>

133
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,449
pseudonymity and no full compromise on

134
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,210
the kilos we want to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle a</font>

135
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,430
lot of key so one keeper device /

136
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,609
service as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that's different from</font>

137
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,919
the approach being taken by chatter we

138
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,360
won't also have security through anti

139
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,789
centralization so you want to

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,510
decentralize the storage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public</font>

141
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:53,370
keys on multiple entities we won't also

142
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,500
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mitigate the last of the</font>

143
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,330
device or compromise so if the device

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,979
gets last we want to be able to remove

145
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> device or be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

146
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,889
keys but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a threshold of</font>

147
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,570
devices who needs to vote on<font color="#CCCCCC"> these on</font>

148
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,880
the change of these keys or the user has

149
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,219
to vote through the devices for the

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">change of these keys and for the</font>

151
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,510
services because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

152
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,849
change the keys to rotate the keys the

153
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:22,860
service need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow all</font>

154
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:25,110
changes of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly keys ok so i will</font>

155
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">present you now the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> components of</font>

156
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,830
the our solution so line is here he got

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,919
a lot of devices long has four devices

158
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:39,060
and in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the new</font>

159
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,620
part he<font color="#E5E5E5"> connects first through a Cathar</font>

160
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">et</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> al present that little bit</font>

161
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,060
what it is and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> choleric t is handled</font>

162
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,699
by Lucy who might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice or might not</font>

163
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,340
be nice but here she says<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody is</font>

164
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,949
entitled<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my block chain we take a</font>

165
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">block chain as a decentralized storage</font>

166
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,910
the centralized database<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

167
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,979
important here it's a private block

168
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,479
chain personalized blockchain Linus has

169
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:03,270
his own block chain if Charlie Brown

170
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,889
also wants to have used<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system you</font>

171
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,359
will have his own block chain and then

172
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,699
on the other side we have the followers

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,669
who contact that block chain and ask for

174
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:14,070
update of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kids okay let's see how</font>

175
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,139
this identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> block chain works so Lucy</font>

176
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,060
also got up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before she was</font>

177
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:22,110
psychiatrist<font color="#CCCCCC"> now she's a block chain</font>

178
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,419
manager the doctor is in as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we</font>

179
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,789
have a closed private block<font color="#E5E5E5"> chain one</font>

180
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,070
per user so if everybody here wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

181
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,440
have a user system everybody will have

182
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,570
its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocking this block chain is</font>

183
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,870
handled by a Coverity it's a collective

184
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,669
authority this uses also the protocols

185
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,740
of the collective signatures it's a

186
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,159
brine for to present at that protocol at

187
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,470
the OSD I 16 so it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

188
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,120
different nodes they can run at

189
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,979
different places one can be run by the

190
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,289
eff one can be run by the tour people

191
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,979
one can be run by a TfL and you can run

192
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:58,650
on your own and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mining is done</font>

193
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,690
by proof of user confirmation so in

194
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,229
order to mine a new block which contains

195
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new ssh public keys the user has to</font>

196
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:10,440
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I confirm that these are the new</font>

197
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,150
keys so make a new block so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">mining part there's no proof of work</font>

199
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,400
there's no proof of of other thing it's

200
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,550
proof of user confirmation and then this

201
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,590
Authority node so here each<font color="#E5E5E5"> Woodstock</font>

202
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,180
bird is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one point for a keynote which</font>

203
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,409

204
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they sign then this new block and so</font>

205
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,779
you can be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it works some</font>

206
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,330
details<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know all the blockchain blah</font>

207
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,729
blah each block is has a link to the

208
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,159
previous block now what we have a little

209
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit what we added here is we added some</font>

210
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,319
collective sign it forward link to

211
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,410
delegate trust so in order to not have

212
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,170
these splits of the chains we say now if

213
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,880
you have a new block this quality is

214
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,219
started again

215
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,410
it will verify whether the user really

216
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,440
confirmed this new block and in the case

217
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,829
it will through a it's called a BF tea

218
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">coffee protocol left wrist will present</font>

219
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,490
that at the next few sec usenix security

220
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:14,090
compose IAM a symposium so in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pft way</font>

221
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,380
this these confer ki will sign on

222
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,010
forward link to the new block and that

223
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">way we have an assured forward path and</font>

224
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,600
all the followers they can be assured

225
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,819
that this block n plus line and plus one

226
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,300
is legit and we that we can really use

227
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,060
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i will finish with a small usage</font>

228
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,650
example so i spin a cupboard I got to

229
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">admit I didn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be typing</font>

230
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,930
commands here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> resulting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues with</font>

231
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,690
talker in the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment so what I</font>

232
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,839
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered Lee I just have screenshots</font>

233
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,150
I hope you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will enjoy anyway so here</font>

234
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,090
what we have is in fact a doctor

235
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:54,600
environment I took here one two three

236
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:57,090
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven docker enviro six</font>

237
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,190
dr. environments so on the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

238
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,830
took three<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctors for the three devices</font>

239
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:05,010
and supposed Linus has three devices in

240
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,040
the middle I took a docker for the

241
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:11,100
clarity so usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confer keynotes</font>

242
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,990
they run in in separate places like I

243
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,880
said one could be here in Germany one

244
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,040
could be at<font color="#CCCCCC"> epfl in Switzerland eff</font>

245
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,540
whatever here for the experiment I put

246
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,569
them all in the same place which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

247
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,540
possible and then we have 12 followers

248
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,560
so these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH servers who will follow</font>

249
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,540
the blockchain to see the updated keys

250
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,069
ok let's start to let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start is a</font>

251
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,439
contour aqui you see some debugging

252
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:38,280
messages saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok success which is</font>

253
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,640
always nice and now with my tool which

254
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:45,209
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called tisk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

255
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">identity chain as I said every use with</font>

256
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,920
will have his own identity chain here I

257
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,310
need to give this group that thermal

258
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,099
which which gives information about

259
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,869
which code 14 notes to use so i can

260
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,370
create my own group normal and then

261
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,460
include whatever plethora keys are

262
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,370
accessible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i said to choose a</font>

263
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,529
bunch of Korra tease you trust and if at

264
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,100
least two-thirds of the authority are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

265
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,509
a you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any troubles</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font>

266
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,709
type that command and I get now this

267
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:18,569
long he here which represents my block

268
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,819
chain so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now my very personal</font>

269
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:23,878
blog chain which has been signed by this

270
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:25,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">code for a key here of course you want</font>

271
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,279
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a follower again with my command</font>

272
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,620
i can say i can type follow at i need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

273
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,420
give the same group file to give the

274
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,480
definition of the con thority and then

275
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,998
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i give the number of my of my block</font>

276
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,059
chain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also start the same</font>

277
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,470
Comanches follow-up date which will now

278
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:46,139
periodically look whether there is a new

279
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,480
key and if it's a new key it will write

280
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to the dot ssh / of the rice keys</font>

281
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,189
file and now what I want to do finally I

282
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:59,490
can start SSH at fall over 1 so I add

283
00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:02,459
that thing you see that the the confer

284
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,779
key he reacted and put up a new proposal

285
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,670
voted for it and also the follower he

286
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,769
saw now that there is a new key for

287
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:15,628
himself and put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the authorized</font>

288
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:17,610
keys and now from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device 1 I can ssh</font>

289
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:21,959
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> fall over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one without having to do</font>

290
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:24,420
any password authentication or such<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

291
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,729
we have a second follower we also let it

292
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,120
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chang you see he doesn't</font>

293
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,009
write anything because I didn't that yet

294
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,930
SSH key to go to him I can add here a

295
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:39,360
second SSH key for the fall over<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

296
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,160
now he also wrote to authorize keys and

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,809
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could also SSH directly that</font>

298
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,319
follower or you skate or use whatever

299
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:49,019
you want to use one<font color="#E5E5E5"> device is not fun we</font>

300
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:52,439
need a second device so instead of ID

301
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:55,230
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right ID connect to say I want</font>

302
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:57,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to connect to that block chain but of</font>

303
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">course this does not connect me directly</font>

304
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,600
because the followers everybody can

305
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,929
follow no problem but if i connect as a

306
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,059
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can change things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in order</font>

307
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:12,689
for that the first device needs now to

308
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:14,579
vote on that so i can vote on it it

309
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:16,079
tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I vote on it tells me</font>

310
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:20,910
there's a new device do you accept that

311
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:24,810
yes and now the second device can also

312
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:28,020
so at an ssh key but because it's two

313
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,790
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to confirm with about the</font>

314
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,160
changes from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second device so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

315
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:36,360
confirm that vote here this config world

316
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,819
and it tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a new ssh key</font>

317
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,640
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to allow that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and now</font>

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:45,270
you see that the follower one here also

319
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,150
wrote this new key in his<font color="#CCCCCC"> son SSH</font>

320
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:52,500
authorized keys we want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

321
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,900
devices again ID connect now I put a

322
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,340
threshold<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i put a threshold of two</font>

323
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:04,290
so I vote on it yes and the first device

324
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:07,110
also has to vote on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and now if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

325
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like adding it key we need to</font>

326
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,950
if I do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adding a key we</font>

327
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,510
need to vote twice on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

328
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,390
compromised if the device gets lost we

329
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,390
can remove it so i can say type IP

330
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,860
remove and then a second device has to

331
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,280
vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it too because from the</font>

332
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,620
threshold of two and now if the attacker

333
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,230
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> i still want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to readd the key</font>

334
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,900
because he got removed here he<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try</font>

335
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,510
but it says didn't find signer he has

336
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,959
been removed so like that dealt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

337
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:43,410
threshold of devices i can always<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,770
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that block chain so we did</font>

339
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,449
this for retail is for requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

340
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,000
next steps first we have to congratulate

341
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,590
Lucy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit people in</font>

342
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,360
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that need an acclamation what</font>

343
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,430
would we do without NSA what would we do

344
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,560
without people who spy on us we would

345
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,199
have no work so thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much Lucy</font>

346
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,930
some of the ideas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next steps here</font>

347
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,030
so including<font color="#E5E5E5"> other keys and signing</font>

348
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,359
protocols again I got a bit inspired by

349
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,730
Aaron also from her project I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some</font>

350
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,350
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be very nice we</font>

351
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,600
thought of embedding that as a field in

352
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,930
clinics so then people would directly be

353
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,910
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the blockchain and some</font>

354
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,540
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to further sue demise and</font>

355
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,920
in fact is this block chain it has just

356
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,819
key value<font color="#E5E5E5"> pairs so we can put whatever</font>

357
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,300
you want win if you have any remarks

358
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,680
questions here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my email and of course</font>

359
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the code is on</font>

360
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,329
authority and you can find also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the so</font>

361
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,300
the cultural moment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a branch</font>

362
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,960
called hpet 16 but I hope it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will soon</font>

363
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,109
be merged into the master branch<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

364
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,110
that's it
