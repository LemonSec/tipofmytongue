<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello everyone today I'm presenting</font>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,110
my work about a location privacy this is

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,660
a joint work with my advisor itching who

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,099
my work folks on the location part of

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,139
the issue in location-based social

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,439
network which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of application</font>

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,130
attack users or their posts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font>

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,160
location and<font color="#CCCCCC"> allow other youth users to</font>

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,210
retrieve the post nearby by distance

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,570
from post to the career and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">will return the post to this to the</font>

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,140
users we're a bunch of such application

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,680
in a world now like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook tinder</font>

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">whispered yeah cake here are the two</font>

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,100
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> we care about location privacy so</font>

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,539
first the<font color="#CCCCCC"> views of location may hurt the</font>

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,600
user in physically and financially for

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,649
example safe may locate users and<font color="#CCCCCC"> grab</font>

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,409
the user's home and the second anonymous

20
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,110
social network is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it's not going</font>

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,049
to be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous if the location</font>

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,020
is exposed because the attacker may

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:18,150
locate you identify the user by their

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,399
location so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on a</font>

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,830
vulnerability of the information leakage

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,869
in from the curry response attacker can

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,429
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> such information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you for a user's</font>

28
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:35,040
location for example so its own system

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,030
allow the attacker to choose distance R

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,880
asshole as they want and the temp you

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,610
can use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> binary search to learn the</font>

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,310
distance from opposed to a to a career

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:52,049
like to the left figure shows for

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:54,630
example an attacker can first have a

35
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,670
curie with distance of three if the

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,280
attacker didn't see the post the

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,049
attacker doubled at Eastern 26 and then

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,110
the attacker may see that post in a

39
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,939
second query and the intelligence can

40
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,970
know the distance between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

41
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,850
and the query is between three and six

42
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,760
and do so then the tiger can buy

43
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,010
binary search to locate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn the</font>

distance between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the post and courier</font>

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,810
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tiger can use a</font>

46
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,650
triangulation like the right figure

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,010
shows to locate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user some existing</font>

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,200
defense like cross-grained distance rest

49
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,230
hope can prevent attacker to use

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,549
triangulation in this defense attacker

51
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,920
can only use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific distance R</font>

52
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">asshole so that I cannot learn the</font>

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,890
distance as the way I mentioned before

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,290
but the tiger can use space petition

55
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:54,160
attack to bypass<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bypass the</font>

56
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:58,060
defense by HBO real attacker can split

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> association region of the user into</font>

58
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,880
two partitions and by the purest bounce

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,180
attacker can learn in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear we</font>

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,900
load<font color="#E5E5E5"> the post the target posted located</font>

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,870
in and that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacker can use binary</font>

62
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,370
search again to locate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user by</font>

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:21,820
swinging the<font color="#E5E5E5"> insertion region yeah then</font>

64
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:27,820
user service provider can add location

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:30,489
noise into the curry response to this to

66
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,570
disguise location noise we<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced</font>

67
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:37,300
response probability function this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

69
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:44,140
opposed to a curie based on distance

70
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,480
between the post to curry for example

71
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:51,339
the left figure shows the system without

so by intuitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee we can use many</font>

84
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,790
curious to cancel the noise right so

85
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:35,300
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose some fake gps location</font>

87
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,990
prevent attacker to make as many as

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,380
cures they want but it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so</font>

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">because distributed attack can easily</font>

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,990
bypass this defense the attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

91
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,469
create a many accounts and each account

92
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,910
just issues a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries to bypass this</font>

93
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,760
defense also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not fake account</font>

94
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:05,390
detection techniques but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they only good</font>

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,789
for large number of accounts so if not

96
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,240
so it's hard to detect a small number of

97
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,760
accounts especially when our counter

98
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,610
manually<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned by human beings so if</font>

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,580
there's not attack just<font color="#E5E5E5"> require few</font>

100
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Curie's namely few accounts then it can</font>

101
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,030
bypass existing defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

102
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,370
previous attack called random which can

103
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,849
bypass existing difference by only works

104
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,920
for Gaussian noise in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper we</font>

105
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">propose the entropy minimization attack</font>

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,570

events but also<font color="#CCCCCC"> is generic can apply to</font>

108
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,860
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of location noise and moreover</font>

109
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it only require one tenth of the Curry's</font>

110
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:56,030
to achieve the same reduction of the

111
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy level and later in a paper we</font>

112
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,840
propose the Brandon is consistent

113
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,479
defense which to limit such attack and

114
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,190
is to park our main<font color="#E5E5E5"> contributions in</font>

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,920
this paper so first i will introduce the

116
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,880
entropy minimization attack we calculate

117
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the location and should be based on the</font>

118
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,490
probability distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the victims</font>

119
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:27,500
location so the left figure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

120
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:30,860
shows that the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more likely in</font>

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,930
the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the map and it'll go of</font>

122
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,910
that the algorithm is to minimize the

123
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,100
entropy so that the attacker can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

124
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,460
sure about

125
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,990
location of the victim by each curry

126
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,250
actually attacker can learn some

127
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:49,010
information of the victims location and

128
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,590
it is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information gained to decrease</font>

129
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:55,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entropy so this example shows that</font>

130
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,510
have the four carries the probability

131
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:03,620
distribution has some changed and the

132
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:06,200
entropy get lowered so here's the

133
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">workflow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack so first the</font>

134
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,909
attacker initialize the probability

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,030
distribution by either flat distribution

136
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:19,730
or some prior knowledge and then the

137
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:21,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">checker make a curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on location X now</font>

138
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,050
the attacker can have a two possible

139
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,080
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> either see the</font>

140
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,410
target post in the response or not and

141
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,840
based on the response attacker updated

142
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,800
probability distribution according to

143
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:40,099
your base row and find the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimal</font>

144
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,080
curry location by minimum I'd by

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,380
minimizing the expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> entropy of the</font>

146

147
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:55,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll just repeat these steps until the</font>

148
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:59,570
entropy small enough and quit loop

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:04,419
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of the khaki</font>

150
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:07,909
variation so we first we have a

151
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:11,599
variation over the culture noise the

153
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,229
by figure shows shows the privacy level

154
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,210
on the y axis and the number of rounds

155
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:27,950
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hector needs on the accesses we can</font>

156
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:31,180
see the title will require 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious</font>

157
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:36,530
to locate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user into you 30 meters</font>

158
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:39,409
but the render requires a 1400 courage

159
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:44,300
to look locate the user into 37<font color="#CCCCCC"> meters</font>

160
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:47,839
as their paper described so this means

161
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,380
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times improvement over the</font>

162
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,840
rent

163
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:58,370
attack so we even did some variation

164
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:01,810
over some higher noise like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> p3 yes</font>

165
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,870
still it also shows the effective

166
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:08,199
effectiveness of the attack we only

167
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:15,440
require 500 calories to locate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

168
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:17,740
into 100 meters<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so then I will</font>

169
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,930
introduce the defense with randomness

170
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,790
consistency the goal is quite of

171
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,719
intuitive we want to limit the

172
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:29,900
information came from a purist so first

173
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,630
we did mapcontact station we contact map

174
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,209
into squares so that attacker can at

175
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,189
most learn the square of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user button</font>

176
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,010
where the user it is in the inside

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">square and then we have a consistent</font>

178
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:46,460

179
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,880

there's no information leaked from the

to a large map without losing more

193
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,620

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:43,130
the map like the figure shows the

multiple hierarchies in maps and for

196
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,960
each hierarchy we have a hierarchy

<font color="#E5E5E5">the usability is dominated by the word</font>

paper here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the example of the</font>

236
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:50,969
difference evaluation the figure comes

with a round number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rounds at x axis</font>

00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:01,019
and didn't price the level at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the y axis</font>

239
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:04,229
so for the attack for the system without

240
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:07,439
defense the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax can lower the price the</font>

devil to almost zero within 100 calories

242
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:14,459
but for the system with our defense the

243
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,599
attacker can never lower the curry 20 no

244
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,540
matter how many

245
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:23,250

information game to attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah let me</font>

247
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,680
conclude my talk first we propose the

248
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,740
potential attack which can bypass

249
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,258
existing defense it is generic attack

250
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,259
which can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied to any location</font>

251
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:40,800
noise and is more effectively existing

252
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:44,899
attack second we propose the randomness

253
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:50,099
consistent defense to limit such attack

254
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:53,029
it applied a map quantization response

255
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,370
consistency and her actual subdivision

256
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:58,199
the defense is scalable to a large map

257
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:04,069
and the large location-based social

258

network<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my talk any questions</font>
