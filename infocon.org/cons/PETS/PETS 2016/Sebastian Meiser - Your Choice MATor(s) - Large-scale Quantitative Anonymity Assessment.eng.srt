1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
people all right um<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">much for the introduction um now I've</font>

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,370
been asked at the conference yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yet another of these boring talks</font>

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,219
that show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ito is not</font>

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,830
perfect two offers anonymity but let's

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,900
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some details and how the</font>

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,880
annuity is not as good as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like</font>

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have it as theoretical researchers</font>

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,890
well you can certainly look at the paper

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,109
and look at this paper is a very good

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,660
example of that category<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we of</font>

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,170
course show lots of results actually

they show that chore as well as other

variants of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour are not perfect okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,370
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's not really focus too</font>

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,610
much on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right everyone knows</font>

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,640
not going to go into detail here the

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze tour and the</font>

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,480
path selection strategies for tour

success now Alison's messages and for

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,639
the talk i'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we want</font>

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say Ellis sending a message to Bob</font>

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
should be indistinguishable from other

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,659
sending a message to Charlie it should

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,460
be indistinguishable no matter off

36
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,600
depending on how we select these nodes

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,329
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,270
strategies um I'm going to go into

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,880
slight detail of them later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want</font>

40
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,740
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be indistinguishable for a</font>

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,110
variety of adversaries that might

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,689
control a group of 20 notes that we

43
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,780
specify via different metrics for

44
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,089
example just a number of nodes or any

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,530
number of nodes as long as the combined

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,119
bandwidth of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nodes is smaller than</font>

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">something or any other such metric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

48
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,290
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the for the definition here um</font>

49
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,479
we're going to use the annual definition

50
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,280
of recipient anonymity also we have

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,890
sender and relationship and animating

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,628
the paper and it works as false it's

53
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,130
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a crypto game imagine like</font>

54
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,630
you're in CP a game in

55
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,150
scription we have necessary the

56
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,470
adversary can compromise some<font color="#E5E5E5"> troll</font>

57
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,170
notes in the beginning to set up the

58
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,480
game and then can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> all to our</font>

59
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,630
users can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now LSU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send exactly</font>

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,549
this message to this to Bob and if you

61
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,940
send a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message to Charlie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on its</font>

62
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,130
own it can make some observations um via

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,130
the compromise notes and it can learn

64
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,560
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and repeatable process and go</font>

65
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,320
and go on and on at some point it sends

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,450
some challenge message now that's where

67
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,070
the dependency or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relation to the</font>

68
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,690
crypto games comes into play because the

69
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,640
Challenger actually has some challenge

70
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,370
bit be that the adversary doesn't know

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,809
and depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this challenge bit the</font>

72
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,060
observations the episode we are going to

73
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">make is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna make or can potentially</font>

74
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,050
make a different because if the bid is

75
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero then Bob actually sends a message</font>

76
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,850
if it's one Charlie sent a message right

77
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,790
this is the anonymity definition that

78
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,100
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and now we're going</font>

79
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,510
to try to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> some cool things since</font>

80
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,640
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of an advertisement talk</font>

81
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,280
because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time to go</font>

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,040
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail I just talked a little bit</font>

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,220
about comparisons of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

84
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,660
better than stuff we did before that is

85
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,520
the episode of course has to guess the

86
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,829
challenge right I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let's assume</font>

87
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,250
that already now there was already work

88
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,320
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCS 14 against an adversary of phone</font>

89
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,570
episode that has at most K<font color="#CCCCCC"> notes for</font>

90
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,150
some number K and four tours path

91
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,769
selection algorithm back then you input

92
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,160
the tour consensus you say what K is

93
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,260
then it runs for a very short time and

94
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,990
outputs and guarantees<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are a little</font>

95
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit over proximate it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool so what</font>

96
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do better we give it a new name</font>

97
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">we put the 2.0 there for example and now</font>

98
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,019
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font>

99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,570
adversaries you can just say okay well

100
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,220
cool let's choose adversaries yeah let's

101
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,200
choose an episode with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a total bandwidth</font>

102
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,330
let's choose an episode that has all

103
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,040
nodes in Germany let's choose an episode

104
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,750
that has maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most controversial</font>

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,179
one a monthly budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some number to</font>

106
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,209
rent<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour servers which would mean it of</font>

107
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,250
course compromises existing servers but

108
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,488
has to pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them has to pay for their</font>

109
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,890
upkeep right so we can try to try to

110
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,859
measure the strength of this episode<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

111
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,628
well then we can

112
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's let's compare towards</font>

113
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,319
position algorithm with I've know

114
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,359
something like uniform routing every

115
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">tour note has the same probabilities</font>

116
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,020
that means performance is absolutely

117
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,849
shitty no one wants to use to anymore

118
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,099
but people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested in analyzing</font>

119
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,810
that so let then let them then um

120
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,909
there's a path detection algorithm that

121
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,310
we proposed foresees yes we can also use

122
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,688
that and have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can have</font>

123
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,370
a look at something like last tour that

124
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:54,409
tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> base the paths that you take on</font>

125
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">your geographical location such that you</font>

126
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:59,688
don't go twice over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the globe with high</font>

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,210
probability and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just choose these</font>

128
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:05,449
things then input the consensus then it

129
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,818
runs for slightly longer time and output

130
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,949
some results in some guarantees<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

131
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,259
that's kind of the goal that's what

132
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,419
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bore</font>

133
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:15,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some technical details in the</font>

134
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,729
hope that you can maybe learn something

135
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,620
about how to analyze systems like two

136
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,688
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not just all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that applies to</font>

137
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,580
many things so what we did is the

138
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,560
following<font color="#CCCCCC"> you first simplified the</font>

139
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,930
analysis a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into</font>

140
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,750
details here but using some assumptions

141
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,300
for example our adversary is passive or

142
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,839
adversary cannot adaptively choose nodes

143
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,669
to kind of follow to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and drink</font>

144
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,089
some proofs we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we consider</font>

145
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:45,529
112 circuit at a time for the very small

146
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,839
guarantees that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have here</font>

147
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:49,879
that a one-shot guarantee is considering

00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now is that ok what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can the</font>

150
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,110
adversary actually see let's assume the

151
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,789
crypto is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let us see assume that</font>

152
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,979
there's no additional side channels

153
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:03,289
there so you can abuse then still an

154
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,539
episode can make observations of the

155
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:09,409
entities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in a tourist circuit</font>

156
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:12,050
and we specify that as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five trouble ok</font>

157
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:14,120
how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look like well mrs. Ellis I</font>

158
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wants to talk to Bob she chooses</font>

159
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,300
some guards and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just assume that</font>

160
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ellis's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet service providers</font>

162
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,990
course and the guard so from the

163
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:26,210
perspective of<font color="#CCCCCC"> alyssa's internet service</font>

165
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,560
inspection or anything that's definitely

166
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,419
something it can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so our</font>

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,459
observation would say well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok there's</font>

168
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,529
Ellis there's this specific guard node

169
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:38,390
and some stuff I can't see we have some

170
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,270
special symbols for things like

171
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,520
see all right if instead the middle node

172
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,340
of a circuit is compromised it can of

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,380
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> see both entry and God can't see</font>

174
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,390
the sender and recipient this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

175
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,430
the observation all right if God an

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">Exeter compromised well we are not very</font>

177
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,660
lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they can see everything so the</font>

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,750

179
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,790
that is connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this dose of it all</font>

180
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,920
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we do then we say for</font>

181
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:07,340
every such observation for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

182
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,680
topple there is if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 double is more</font>

183
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,950
likely the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit is 0 then if the bid is</font>

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,840
one that's bad right because that means

185
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,969
the adversary can learn something from

186
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,770
the five topple even if it cannot

187
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,830
completely and immediately break

188
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,780
anonymity it can infer information about

189
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,240
the recipient just because the

190
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,859
probabilities are different so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,290
just for a second assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know</font>

192
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,320
which nodes are compromised then we can

193
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,850
for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> note calculate over</font>

sorry for everything observation

195
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,350
calculate the probability that this

particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of notes compromised</font>

challenge with the zeros of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ella sends a</font>

199
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,260

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge buttress being one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

then we can compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> these probabilities</font>

202
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,280
we can say well okay this is the impact

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that one particular observation right</font>

204
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,909
we can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every single</font>

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">observation we can sum up the impacts</font>

206
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,440
and get the advantage the adversary has

207
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,320
and distinguishing the challenge bit in

208
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,080
winning<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

209
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,450
cool we would be done but unfortunately

210
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,729
we don't know which notes the episode

211
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,969
wants to arm compromise we could check

212
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:19,640
every subset which in practice takes a

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,490
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> long so we said okay let's over</font>

approximate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font>

which other well the weakest points the

advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that well we</font>

222
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,719
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over every possible observation then</font>

223
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,730
we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay who actually can make this</font>

224
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,610
observation an observation of this form

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,980
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be made exactly if the</font>

guard was compromised the observation

228
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,000
would include the sender as well right

229
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,640
so we could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is made by the</font>

230
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle node we calculate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact of</font>

this small<font color="#E5E5E5"> observation and we just</font>

232
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,260
attach it to the middle node we do that

233
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,260
over every possible observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get for every note some small</font>

236
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
the observation advantages that the

237
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,560
adversary could have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay with me</font>

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,079
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just I just assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

239
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,209
silence means yes and continues so now

240
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,800
we have for every<font color="#CCCCCC"> node some small tag of</font>

241
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,390
course in some cases it's more

242
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,359
complicated please have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the</font>

243
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,860
paper for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and now we say okay how</font>

244
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we get all these different types</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

245
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,690
adversaries we're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in we do</font>

246
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,699
that by saying well in addition to the

247
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,279
advantage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have by a four node or</font>

248
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,950
this impact we attach a cost to every

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,810
node some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost f we have a function</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

250
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each know the cost and</font>

251
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,670
now the episode has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> budget and if it</font>

252
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,390
wants to compromise note<font color="#CCCCCC"> B well we</font>

253
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,860
deduct that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost from the budget and we</font>

254
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,019
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so for every note it wants to</font>

255
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,519
compromise that how an episode can win

256
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:10,959
and that's how we measure adversaries

257
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:13,630
what we do then is we try to find the

258
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,380
maximal set that is still satisfying

259
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:19,420
this budget and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

260
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantages of the nodes in this set and</font>

261
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,329
I just claim that this can be easily

262
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,600
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily approximated than</font>

263
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:31,569
considering every possible set all right

264
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,800
now um since this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertisement</font>

265
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,230
anyway please have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the paper</font>

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the slightly more complex formula at</font>

267
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,680
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we do things because it's</font>

268
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,810
actually you actually have to take care

269
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,479
of a couple of very interesting slide

270
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,189
conditions and also have a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

271
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,790
technical report for the very exciting

272
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:51,519
17 pages of proof that are interesting

273
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,120
because the adversary can learn stuff if

274
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,470
he does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not make observations right that</font>

275
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something we also have to capture</font>

276
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that made the proof kind of complicated</font>

277
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,219
if the adversary has a slightly lower

278
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,250
probability of not seeing something

279
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,410
then of course that also helps in

280
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,959
figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who this who the recipient</font>

281
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,699
of a messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now we've done that</font>

282
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,888
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can look</font>

283
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:17,378
at graphs these graphs this is graphs

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,819
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> tour let us cross for comparing tour</font>

285
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,889
with other path selection algorithms

00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:22,509
let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

287
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:25,329
examples for that this is again

288
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:27,579
recipient anonymity and we see here

289
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:30,189
comparison of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uniform part section</font>

290
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:32,949
algorithm with tours path selection

291
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:35,110
algorithm select<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's an add-on</font>

292
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:37,089
that just restricts allows you to

293
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,120
restrict yourself to a specific exit

294
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,310
node country then distribute or our

295
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,230
thing and two variants of last one where

296
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,000
the recipients are close by one where

297
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,639
there are further away and what you see

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layman terms if it's below</font>

299
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,079
zero that means they performed better

300
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,300
than 20 against these<font color="#E5E5E5"> adversaries if</font>

301
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,888
it's above zero it performed worse

302
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,469
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the episode we had a better</font>

303
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,879
chance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> winning and we can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4k</font>

304
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,110
know that for surreys something like

305
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,199
uniform distribution is of course

306
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,970
optimal right the episode<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a fixed</font>

307
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:08,920
number of nodes and if you choose

308
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,829
uniformly of course the adversary has a

309
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,329
smaller chance of winning similar for

310
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:17,680
last row because the variants we used

311
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:19,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're within clusters kind of uniform if</font>

312
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,099
it's talked if we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

313
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,370
bandwidth it's a completely different

314
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">picture right and then we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font>

315
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,629
the country is and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much impact</font>

316
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,850
countries have what we can see here is

00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:33,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. if you only chose exit</font>

expected and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can also see some other</font>

320
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,860
cool correlations and other cool things

321
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,730
you can see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if the</font>

322
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,860
adversary has a monetary budget and you

323
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,509
can you can now finally compare this

324
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,949
path selection algorithms to toss path

325
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,259
selection algorithms and to each other

326
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:51,939
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I want</font>

327
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,490
to say before I before I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut up</font>

328
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:55,959
is the transition phase imagine the

329
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,759
following scenario Ellis comes and says

330
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,319
hey cool look there's this great new

331
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,879
path selection algorithm I'm totally

332
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:03,099
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be much</font>

333
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,370
more secure and Bob's like I don't know

334
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,930
Ellis<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's do we didn't</font>

335
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,679
test it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick to the</font>

336
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,540
standard for now and what happens here

337
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that now these two users become</font>

338
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,569
easily distinguishable because the path

339
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,000
selection algorithms

340
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,310
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the way they</font>

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,600
choose notes this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show the</font>

342
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,630
episode is going to notice these

343
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,200
differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> in probabilities in graphs</font>

344
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,360
we see values are pretty high I think

345
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,900
that's all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I have for for going</font>

346
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,030
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail here and we can also analyze</font>

347
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,069
stuff over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just take several</font>

348
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk on censuses and look how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crafts</font>

349
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:45,100
change over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> also very cool so</font>

350
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,350
that's basically the stuff we can do

351
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,380
with these tools as a wrap up its range

352
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:53,350
it's cool matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you should</font>

353
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,360
you should remember for known at the

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,200
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can precisely calculate</font>

355
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,490
things which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cool then another</font>

type of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message is if you want to</font>

improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymity that highly depends on</font>

358
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,670
against whom if you want to improve

359
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">anonymity against your adversaries that</font>

360
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,290
have a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> small number of nodes try</font>

361
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,720
to be uniform probably if you want to

362
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,790
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymity against episodes that</font>

363
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,960
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain amount of bandwidth well</font>

364
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,050
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing pretty good in that</font>

365
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,640
because the higher the bandwidth over to

366
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,770
a note the higher the probability that

367
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,490
it's used so the adversary can't exploit

368
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:29,920
some differences here to get more than

369
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,080
it can pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so you really have to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">look carefully and another thing you</font>

371
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,320
could take away is if you want to

372
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,840
analyze anonymity try to look at all

373
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,240
possible things the episode can see try

374
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,060
to define it very carefully and look at

375
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,310
the different probabilities of

376
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,910
observations and the lack thereof and

377
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:51,160
yeah well finally varying path selection

378
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,980
per user or whatever you do where the

379
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,469
users ID or location influences the path

380
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,360
selection might be a bad idea against

381
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,820
many adversaries because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes them</font>

382
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,460
distinguishable same for the recipients

383
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,680
on the other side and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

384
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,370
about it thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what I hope its</font>

385
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,370
attention and
