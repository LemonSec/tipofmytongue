00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
it's a joint work with several<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

Gabriel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Evandro are also at this</font>

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,529
conference so afterwards if anyone has

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions they think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should also talk</font>

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,779
with them so how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,029
familiar with the right to be forgotten

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,009
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you you probably heard about</font>

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,420
in the news media what we're going to do

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,860
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is briefly go over the motivation</font>

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how its implemented and then we're</font>

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,190
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to our main findings so</font>

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:50,360
let's not seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going forward here</font>

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,360
when I click my can't move this here

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:05,220
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now it's working okay great so</font>

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,990
um unfortunately I can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the</font>

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,179
screen though but that's I guess what

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,179
that's okay I'll just look up at it here

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:20,339
okay all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have to just step</font>

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:24,929
back then so um the motivation behind

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:30,119
the law is that when someone Google's

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,710
your name and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google your name in</font>

24
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,630
the first link that comes up when they

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,639
Google your name is a an article about a

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,000
crime that you perhaps committed 20

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,490
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> or perhaps it's a crime for</font>

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,770
which you were acquitted or perhaps

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,030
something a minor crime that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did</font>

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,220
when you were very young when you were a

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,979
teenager or maybe it's just some

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,548
personal private information such as

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,799
your home address or your social

34
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,810
security number if that situation

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,000
happens and what can you do there's you

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,890
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the past there's not much you</font>

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,929
could do but cry but fortunately the

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,720
European Union came along a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

39
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and created this so-called right</font>

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,690
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgotten law which imposes</font>

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,670
restrictions on search engines and so in

42
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,030
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works as follows well</font>

43
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:29,829
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so the process works as follows</font>

44
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:32,620
if first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I began</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2014 and what</font>

45
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,780
you do is if you want to have something

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,120
removed something forgotten from a

47
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,100
search engine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and</font>

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,290
you fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> out an online form where you</font>

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,390
provide information like your name the

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">URL you want removed the reason why you</font>

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,390
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be removed in the country you</font>

52
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:52,690
live in and then there's a committee at

53
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google based in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dublin that decides</font>

54
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,390
whether that request should be approved

55
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,310
or not and according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the google the</font>

56
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,920
google website the<font color="#E5E5E5"> google transparency</font>

57
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,420
site the committee makes this decision

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,059
based on whether it's it's it's private

59
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,609
or sensitive information<font color="#E5E5E5"> its content</font>

60
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,370
that relates to so they'll go ahead and

61
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,800
honor the request if its private or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

62
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,080
sensitive information if its content

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,510
that relates to minors if it's a minor

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,110
crime occurring when a requester was a

65
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,690
minor and also often for acquittals

66
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:32,050
exonerations and spent convictions and

67
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,760
google also may decline to delist it if

68
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,980
it determines the page contains

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:42,310
information which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not publicly</font>

70
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:46,570
available so how does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> google go about</font>

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:54,459
implementing this law so or not just

72
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:57,970
google any search engine so so what the

73
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:00,010
way it basically works is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if google</font>

74
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,130
accepts your request then if someone

75
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes in now and searches your name that</font>

76
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,799
link will no longer appear that this is

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,530
this is only applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> European</font>

78
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,570
properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Google will talk about</font>

79
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,589
google com in a second but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other</font>

80
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:20,440
hand suppose that that it has to do so

81
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,969
if Joe at John Doe made this request and

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,710
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> search John Doe you'll no</font>

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,230
longer see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link but let's suppose</font>

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,210
now that has to do

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,370
if john de john doe taking a trip to

86
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">shanghai if your query is trip to</font>

87
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">shanghai then the link will still appear</font>

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,750
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> google only removes the link if the</font>

89
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,640
query includes the name of the requester

90
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,910
so that's an important thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in</font>

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,800
mind as we get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the study here the</font>

92
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,750
one important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep in mind also</font>

93
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,020
is that the right to be forgotten law

94
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,580
does not affect any original content so

95
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,799
if there's if it's an article that

96
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,400
appeared for example in the daily mail

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,720
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> in el mando or any european newspaper</font>

98
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,880
and and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google einar's a</font>

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,060
request to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the link forgotten the</font>

100
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,680
content still exists in the web at the

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,920
ridge at the public in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> publishers</font>

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,410
website and finally one last thing is

103
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,570
currently there some debate about this

104
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,720
right now but currently all the links

105
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,030
remain on google com so that even though

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,870
the ranks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> removed from google</font>

107
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:31,590
yes google UK google.fr the links are

108
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:34,530
still there in google com well one other

109
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:37,799
a point to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> here also is that when</font>

110
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,960
Google does remove a link it notifies

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,000
the publisher so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if it</font>

112
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,039
removes a link that points to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article</font>

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,070
that was published in The Daily Mail

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,950
then Google will send an email to the

115
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">webmaster of the Daily Mail indicating</font>

116
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,060
that this link has been removed so all

117
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,370
the newspapers know exactly which links

118
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,150
have been have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been removed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and have not</font>

119
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,320
been removed however<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google does not</font>

120
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,810
when Google does make this notification

121
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,990
it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicate who the requester</font>

122
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,370
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> only provides the URL to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

123
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:14,910
webmaster so what has been the effect of

124
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,180
this law first of all there's been over

125
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,750
1.5 million links<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been removed for</font>

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,770
individuals in the European Union<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

127
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,340
approximately forty-three percent of the

128
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,859
requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was forty-three percent of</font>

129
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,409
the requests requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> that URLs have</font>

130
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,140
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> removed so there's been 1.5 million</font>

131
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,590
requests for URLs and forty-three

132
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,729
percent of them have been removed so I

133
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,020
don't want to

134
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,318
don't know if I'm going to belabor this

135
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,299
too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font>

136
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,610
on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just mentioned that there is</font>

137
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,919
a debate on going there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

138
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:54,689
a lot of papers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the legal</font>

about the right to be forgotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus</font>

could be fully passed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

censorship from some perspectives the

148
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:21,930
other issue is that it's it demonstrates

contribution here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

164
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,089
data-driven study of the right to be

166
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:10,139
the first papers to address the right to

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been a quite a bit of work on on</font>

the area on the subject in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal</font>

170
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,209
community as I mentioned earlier and

171
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,069
we'd like to hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results of</font>

172
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:25,469
this paper can inform the debate and

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:27,569
future evolution of the RT BF law so are

174
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:32,669
the main result that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

175
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:34,620
today is this this this possibility that

176
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right to be forgotten can be</font>

177
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,169
attacked and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we mean by attacking</font>

178
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,120
the right to be forgotten is as follows

179
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,970
with moderate resources and hacking

180
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,060
skills a transparency<font color="#CCCCCC"> activist can</font>

181
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,430
determine ballistic URLs in the names of

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,250
the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> requested to be listings</font>

183
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:58,489
the activists can then republish those

184
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">URLs and the names once on his or her</font>

185
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,500
own website and finally this that by

186
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,570
doing that this could lead to the

187
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">so-called Streisand effect and the</font>

188
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,370
Streisand effect is a term that's often

189
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,839
used in the privacy community which

190
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:18,250
means the when when someone tries to

191
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,300
hide remove or<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

192
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,269
inadvertently that it makes the

193
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,089
information even more visible and and

194
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:28,579
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people see it even more so the so</font>

195
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:30,680
the so the main argument we want to make

196
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:32,899
here is the right to be forgotten in

197
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,339
some situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of helping</font>

198
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:39,470
someone hide this is what they want what

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:47,420
they want to have hidden<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font>

200

actually make it more<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known some</font>

there's been there's 200 there's as I

207
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:14,390
mentioned earlier when Google the list a

gone ahead and republished all those

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,370
URLs in its newspaper so you can just go

212
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,250
to these to these websites you can go to

213

the BBC to Telegraph<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Daily Mail in</font>

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,810
some reason it's only the UK that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

this we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of any other</font>

that does this but for whatever reason

221
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,839
this is happening in the UK so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

222

our just a summary of our data set we

have 230 283 known delisted URLs we can

<font color="#E5E5E5">article is you know 400 to 600 words</font>

228
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:16,939
what's important here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this study is</font>

229
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:18,920
the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> names that are mentioned</font>

230
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:21,829
in each article and we see that

231
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,319
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's only you know</font>

232
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:27,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one name is mentioned an article on</font>

233
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:33,589
average 2.1 names are mentioned at any

234
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:36,290
one article in our data set and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so first</font>

235
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,569
thing we did was a manual topic analysis

236
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,339
of these articles<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just SAT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and read</font>

237
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,469
the articles and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then classified the</font>

238
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:46,149
articles into different categories and

239
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,309
we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these were the topics that</font>

240
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:52,430
that that were included<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the article</font>

241
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:55,910
so they range from sexual assault to

242
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,079
financial misconduct the pedophilia so

243
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:02,389
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have to do with sexual</font>

244
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:04,189
misconduct sexual related issues many of

245
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,379
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with financial issues as</font>

246
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:14,779
well but some also deal with things like

247
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:17,240
spying terrorism drugs as well then what

248
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:19,699
we did is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also use the latent dear</font>

249
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">schley allocation method to also</font>

250
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:25,459
automatically analyze the topics and

251
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:27,910
these 283 articles and late interior

252
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:30,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">schley allocation is an unsupervised</font>

253
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,389
generative machine learning technique

254
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,850
that's very popular now for analyzing

255
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:38,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">text and we came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up when we did this we</font>

256
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,059
came up with some similar results these

257
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,079
are the top eight topics that were

258
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:46,850
discovered in in the corpus and the

259
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,248
first the top topic was dealing with

260
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">violent crime the second one was with I</font>

261
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:56,179
drunk drugged driving third one domestic

262
00:12:53,329 --> 00:13:03,439
drug use murder prostitution financial

263
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:06,110
misconduct and sexual<font color="#CCCCCC"> assault great okay</font>

264
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:10,550
so somewhat now I'm going to go over

265
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,809
these attacks these attacks walk we feel

266
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,029
are probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

267
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,469
contribution of this work and the tax

268
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">were motivated we're somewhat</font>

269
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,570
inspired by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> data driven study that</font>

270
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,630
we just just went<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and so the first</font>

271
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,850
one is given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a URL</font>

272
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,520
has been delisted so suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

273
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a particular URL is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lister how</font>

274
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,210
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we determine who is what what person</font>

275
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,220
made the request for that URL and the

276
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,860
attack is quite straightforward you just

277
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,510
take to the listed article you determine

278
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,550
you look read the article and determine

279
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,590
all the names in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the article and then</font>

280
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,300
for each name your query google<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

281
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,720
say again it's an art and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been</font>

282
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,020
delisted in some and UK newspaper your

283
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:59,820
query a google UK with name and article

284
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,770
title and if the article<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are when</font>

285
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,680
you get to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the results if the</font>

286
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,020
article URL is not listed then you know

287
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,880
that that particular name is indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

288
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,920
requester because that's how the right

289
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,200
to be forgotten law works and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

290
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,300
and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even on Google's</font>

291
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,310
transparency page it says this is

292
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,530
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process so very very</font>

293
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,930
simple attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to know they</font>

294
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:26,850
determine who is the requester of a

295
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:29,699
particular delisted article so we were

296
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,370
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a a demographic study on that</font>

297
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:37,290
one say too much we found that 87.5

298
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:39,090
percent other requesters are male and we

299
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,400
also were able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by reading the</font>

300
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,160
articles we're able determine off in

301
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,840
their ages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their professions I'm</font>

302
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to skip this for like a time now</font>

303
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,490
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the main attack</font>

304
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,010
that I want to emphasize here that I

305
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,110
that attack that we think puts the right

306
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,080
to be forgotten in question to some

307
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,210
extent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the attack is is again</font>

308
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,630
fairly straightforward and hear what we

309
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:06,390
want to do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is try to determine</font>

310
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:08,640
previously unknown delisted links and

311
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requesters for those delisted links</font>

312
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,680
because the vomit transparency<font color="#CCCCCC"> optics</font>

313
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,280
advocate and if I can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that determine</font>

314
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,349
very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine delisted lengths</font>

315
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,329
and the requesters for those delisted

316
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,540
ranks then I can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a website and</font>

317
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,490
publish all that material there and and

318
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,150
now people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just go to my website and</font>

319
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:32,700
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if if I have any</font>

320
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,650
any articles that were delisted and in

321
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,630
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> there already exist once website</font>

322
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,100
called hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> from google that does</font>

323
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,930
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they didn't use our</font>

324
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,260
attack to do that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did just</font>

325
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">gather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links again from the from those</font>

326
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,830
that were republished in the news media

327
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,170
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but there is already</font>

328
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing site thats existed for several</font>

329
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,360
years now doing that so the attack is

330
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,910
very as follows it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> divide and</font>

331
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">conquer attack where you pick one</font>

332
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,050
newspaper at a time so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you</font>

333
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,870
might pick el<font color="#E5E5E5"> mando the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spanish</font>

334
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,589
newspaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you crawl and download all</font>

335
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,090
the digital articles of el mando so you

336
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,160
first go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you crawl all the</font>

337
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">articles it's not very hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

338
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,459
these you know these newspapers are not

339
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,080
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated you can usually do</font>

340
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the some newspapers provide</font>

341
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,640
all the articles on a DV<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a CD and</font>

342
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,070
then you put all the articles in a

343
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,810
database and you search on terms related

344
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,480
to topics typically requested for

345
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,189
removal and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> those articles</font>

346
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,290
automatically collect all the names

347
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,490
mentioned you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use automated tools</font>

348
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,920
automated natural language processing

349
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,110
tools to extract the names from all the

350
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,089
articles and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you write a script</font>

351
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,450
that puts each name<font color="#E5E5E5"> in article title</font>

352
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,550
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> google yes and then checks for the</font>

353
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,650
links that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are returned and once again</font>

354
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,959
if any of these are for any of these

355
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:52,890
articles<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the article URL is not</font>

356
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,710
listed then the URL is de listed and the

357
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:58,230
name is the requester so the attack is

358
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,080
is as straightforward as that and we did

359
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,300
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you know we didn't want to</font>

360
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">tack the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entire all the newspapers in</font>

361
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,359
the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European Union but we did do</font>

362
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,480
a small case study<font color="#CCCCCC"> here proof of concept</font>

363
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,889
with el mando so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually just</font>

364
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,650
jump to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that real quick here so what we</font>

365
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">did and Gabriel who's in the audience</font>

366
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,440
was a person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> carried this out so we</font>

367
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,800
queried el mando with 37<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spanish terms</font>

368
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,780
related to crime and downloaded 85,000

369
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,490
articles and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we can we</font>

370
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,889
automatically extracted all the names

371
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,410
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> those articles and then to reduce</font>

372
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,050
the quarry effort we used heuristics to

373
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter the filter the queries we didn't</font>

374
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,080
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to google too many queries</font>

375
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,830
we were concerned that we'd be blocked

376
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,418
or

377
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:49,260
or you know we also concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

378
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:51,720
ethical issues so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended up with 6410</font>

379
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,629
queries each queries again a combination

380
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,179
of article title and name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of requester</font>

381
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:01,529
and then we sequentially query<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google es</font>

382
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:04,320
from a single machine we just use a

383
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:08,190
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine based in Brazil to query</font>

384
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:13,649
at Google yes and and then doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

385
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:18,149
discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> two previously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Dlisted</font>

386
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:20,549
links that were previously unknown and

387
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:22,080
after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was done we went ahead</font>

388
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:24,090
and double check to make sure that those

389
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,189
you know those links are there somewhere

390
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check query in</font>

391
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:32,519
google es with the title only<font color="#CCCCCC"> in google</font>

392
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,799
com with the name of the requester and

393
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:38,220
in both cases that links in all cases

394
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the links would come up okay so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

395
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:47,730
just then just conclude this last slide

396
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:49,889
and so basically conclusion is that our

397
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,539
TBF can be broken for links to<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

398
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:57,209
media we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> no apparent defense to this</font>

399
00:18:53,539 --> 00:19:00,690
attack remains valid if our TBF is

400
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,730
extended to google com the other point

401
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is an important point to</font>

402
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:10,380
emphasize is that the even if this

403
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:12,299
attack is valid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's RTR right to be</font>

404
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,429
forgotten in our opinion still serves an

405
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:17,908
important role and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that</font>

406
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:20,789
ninety-five percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs that are</font>

407
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:22,590
requested to be removed our URLs for

408
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:24,210
personal private information this is

409
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,610
something that's not emphasized in the

410
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,260
news media at all but it's but if you

411
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,658
dig you know dig down into it you find

412
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">out this is a truth so most of requests</font>

413
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,159
are for things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't want my</font>

414
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,919
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> number to be publicly known or my</font>

415

email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address to be publicly known and</font>

416
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,299
it's those that information is typically

417
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,279
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in news articles but it's instead in</font>

418
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,769
social media such as Facebook or YouTube

419
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:50,610
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort and it's much</font>

420
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:52,200
harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncover the delisted links for</font>

421
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,320
those social networks mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

422
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,779
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so much content out there</font>

423
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,809
and it just be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very computationally</font>

424
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:04,429
expensive to be able to perform that and

425
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,960
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know mention just very</font>

426
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:08,990
briefly that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me there's we've done an</font>

427
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,299
earlier study also questioning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Copa</font>

428
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,570
law and we also shared in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case that</font>

429
