work on dissecting and mitigating the

what we call the curious case of the PDF

research we target<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party cloud</font>

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,890
apps typically users have been uploading

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,280
files to cloud service providers like

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,469
Dropbox and Google Drive nowadays there

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">is actually a growing ecosystem of</font>

third-party apps that connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,090

data from there instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the users</font>

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,530
putting data from their desktops and

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,750
this allows users for example to edit

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,230
photos just directly by importing them

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:03,149
from Dropbox or to some PDF documents

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,939
etc however<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this growing ecosystem</font>

22
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,460
we have a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem instead of users</font>

23
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,669
seeing their privacy as threatened by

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,820
one adversary it's now thousands of

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,240
adversaries and these thousands of

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,720
adversaries are more powerful or more

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,460
dangerous than the traditional cloud

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,929
service providers because these are less

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,869
accountable and generally they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,110
secure and they they don't usually have

31
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,450
privacy policies this is in the White

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,100
Lion ecosystem in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wild and that's</font>

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,110
why people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been complaining because</font>

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,149
people store a wealth of data like

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,180
medical financial data on dropbox and

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,680
google drive and actually they complain

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,560
on social media like they post

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,930

ourselves the following research

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,460
questions first how much do these

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,429

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,640
basically has two levels of access when

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,640
it comes to data itself so there's per

57

file access users authorize the

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,089

64
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,730
there are other types of access like

metadata access and access<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list of</font>

introduced google photos specific access

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,830
but this hasn't has not yet been used a

69
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,190
lot by developers these were the main

70
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,850
access levels at that time so in order

71
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze and to quantify the risk we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually checked the 100 top featured</font>

store there's a section for that on

75
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,709
chrome store and for these apps we

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,410
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> the requested api's that is</font>

77
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,560
what the app actually displays to the

78
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,410
user I want these with that potentially

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,390
with the needed api's so for the

80
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,450
requested api's we went to each of these

81
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,549
apps on the way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the apps website and</font>

82
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,609
we check what permissions it needs we

83
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,860
try to sign in etc and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needed</font>

84
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are the needed API is we</font>

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,170
checked we did permission reviews so we

86
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,880
checked the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the application</font>

87
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,420
and how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> access Google Drive I will</font>

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,549
explain that now just a note that it is

89
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,530
challenging to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on a large scale</font>

90
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,400
with the cloud apps not the same as in

91
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android apps or in other ecosystems I</font>

92
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,388
can answer and explain that more offline

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">or neck</font>

94
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:29,979
and the questions part but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

95
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:31,688
a note about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so this is that this</font>

96
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example of an over privileged</font>

97
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:36,849
application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go this is a PDF to</font>

98
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,979
word converter you go you connected to

99
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,509
Google Drive it asks you I want to view

100
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,389
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage all the files in your google</font>

101
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:46,810
drive just to convert a PDF to a work

102
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:49,569
then I allow it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see now</font>

103
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,240
that the application redirects me to add

104
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:54,370
an interface this interface is provided

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,009
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google provides this</font>

106
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,840
interface as a mediation between the

107
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,360
user and the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> and order</font>

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,279
specifically to allow per file access

109
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,740
and not full access so when an

110
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:09,699
application uses this interface solidly

111
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,669
it is me it needs / file access not full

112
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,740
access by comparison this is at least

113
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,349
privileged app this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only office it's</font>

114
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,210
an office office viewer application so

115
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go to the application also connected</font>

116
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to google drive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it also requests</font>

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,779
full<font color="#E5E5E5"> access now the application you will</font>

118
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,360
see that it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not redirect to any</font>

119
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:30,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google interface so the application has</font>

120
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,139
to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of files and</font>

121
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,930
folders and show them to you in the

122
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,120
interface and then you can open the file

123
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,319
all in the application so that is

124
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually connecting to the API</font>

125
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,669
requesting each and every file without

126
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,508
you intervening this app actually

127
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:51,068
requests and means full access based on

128
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:54,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this rationale and we classified or we</font>

129
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:55,689
decided whether the apps are over

130
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,330
privileged or not and what permissions

131
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:01,539
they actually need if the interface is

132
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,878
made mediated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google interface then</font>

133
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:07,089
the app needs / file access if not and

134
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,339
the app doesn't use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google file</font>

135
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,319
picker and it needs the functional it

136
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,839
needs the content then the app needs

137
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,669
full access we have more explanation in

138
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,539
the paper about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decision methodology</font>

139
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:21,818
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result we found the following 76 of</font>

140
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,680
the hundred featured apps on on chrome

141
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,229
store were over privileged<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

142
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,500
requested full access while they needed

143
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">per file access now the most surprising</font>

144
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,240
result was sixty-four percent of these

145
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,169
apps were over privileged and all of the

146

other privileged

147
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">requested full access so as a result</font>

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,599
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty four percent of full</font>

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:48,999
access apps we're over privileged that

150
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:51,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">motivated us to try to help users avoid</font>

151
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,310
over privileged apps and this is our

152
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,620
approach web was basically to try to add

153
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,680
new privacy indicators<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate</font>

154
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,449
the risk in a better way so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

155
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">current interface provided by google it</font>

156
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:07,029
has the list of permissions to institute

157
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,569
to authorize now what we did first is

158
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:13,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we introduced the first privacy</font>

159
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,310
indicator it consisted of splitting

160
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,319
these permissions into the unneeded

161
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,050
permissions and the needed permissions

162
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,029
so the same in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way we have</font>

163
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,490
enabled the permissions before we did

164
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,960
also labeling here to know what the

165
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,909
permissions are what permissions are

166
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,770
needed and not and we integrated that

167
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,129
into the interface so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

168
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,049
interface we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried we wanted to test</font>

169
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,300
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we call the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta</font>

170
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:43,000
permissions model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Delta which is</font>

171
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:44,800
unneeded is told to the user now we take

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,930
this a permissions and we added

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,330
something else we answer the following

174
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,240
question in the interface what do the

175
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,560
unneeded permissions say about you so we

176
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought we told the user this</font>

177
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,560
information will be related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

178
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,399
application or to that to the company

179
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,199
the first type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provided is</font>

180
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,379
what we call immediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> insight that is</font>

181
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,379
direct examples from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users data so</font>

182
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:13,860
for example photos that the user has has

183
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:16,210
taken and put in Google Drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

184
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,939
actually locations that the user has

185
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,339
been in based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> location metadata of</font>

186
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,199
photos in Google Drive we also showed

187
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,960
also excerpts from files these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

188
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,899
directly extracted from the users Google

189
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,210
Drive now we had another thing which is

190
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,240
far-reaching insights we answer the

191
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">question in another way based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

192
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,190
analyzing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users data we could and</font>

193
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,490
the app itself could get more insights

194
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,380
about the user so for example the app

195
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,760
can know what entities concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

196
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,279
topics are interesting to the user

197
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,850
that's what's something we displayed in

198
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,850
the interface

199
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,740
we also show the user what sentiments

200
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,290
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> extracted from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their documents</font>

201
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,500
if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro something or against</font>

202
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,529
something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top collaborators</font>

203
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,930
they work with what shared interests

204
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:09,519
they have with these collaborators in

205
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,209
photos also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we showed what are the top</font>

206
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,519
faces that appear in group and users and

207
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,709
photos<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what objects appear with</font>

208
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,259
these faces this is another interface we

209
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,630
call it faces with context and finally

210
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,399
we put these faces on the map where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

211
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,930
were taking the photos were taken there

212
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,870
so we put them there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also show</font>

213
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,120
this inside to the user so we ended up

214
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,759
with four models the baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> delta</font>

215
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,569
immediate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> far each now we wanted to</font>

216
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,980
test them so in the user experiment we

217
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:44,459
had four groups corresponding to these

218
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:46,540
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> four models the first group so in</font>

219
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,219
the in the first group we had the

220
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,709
baseline and then the others we had that

221
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:56,980
the other new indicators each group had

222
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:59,920
one model we didn't have mixed we didn't

223
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,569
mix models among groups but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

224
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,550
immediate and the far-reaching insights

225
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,990
had the different visuals corresponding

226
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the immediate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and far-reaching</font>

227
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,810
insights that's why it's a split split

228
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:13,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloud design 210 users were recruited</font>

229
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,079
mainly via<font color="#E5E5E5"> University mailing list we we</font>

230
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:21,220
also got users from participants from

231
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,739
tech websites and then we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

232
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,860
experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiment consisted of a</font>

233
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,380
last list of tasks so tasks<font color="#CCCCCC"> are app</font>

234
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,060
installation tasks so for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> select</font>

235
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,189
the app which allows you to extract the

236
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,719
zip file in your google drive the user

237
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:37,060
would go and we'll see an interface

238
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,970
similar to a chrome chrome store and

239
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,219
based on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> permissions they are asked</font>

240
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,779
whether they are think that permissions

241
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,939
are too invasive or there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

242
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:50,560
whether they accept or reject and so on

243
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:53,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth this is one task of the</font>

244
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">list of tasks given today you later so</font>

245
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,199
the first finding I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

246
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the following so first just the</font>

247
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,790
metric we use in our results is the

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,750
acceptance like

249
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:09,410
that is what is the percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

250
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,040
participants in each group which who

251
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:16,930
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> still accept the over privileged</font>

252
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:21,500
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus that one's religion</font>

253
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:23,150
so the baseline model and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta</font>

254
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">permission model were pretty close</font>

255
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,870
actually surprisingly that the

256
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,440
permission model didn't help that is

257
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,570
telling users only that these this app

258
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,460
needs unneeded permissions didn't help

259
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:41,300
much however the immediate insights

260
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:45,230
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> held twice to help to actually</font>

261
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,150
reduce by a factor almost off to the

262
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,400
acceptance likelihood so it was very

263
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective and even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more effective was</font>

264
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,939
the far-reaching insight so far reaching

265
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,310
inside another was significantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

266
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,740
effective than immediate insight which

267
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:02,689
was significant Civic significantly more

268
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,820
effective than<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta and baseline the</font>

269
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,950
second outcome of our experiment was

270
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,050
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed the following relational</font>

271
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,600
insights that is insights that describe

272
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,640
your relations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> others that is whom</font>

273
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
do you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out with what shared interests</font>

274
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,280
you have were actually the most

275
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,930
effective yeah the most effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

276
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,939
deterring users from installing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,859
provisional applications compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

278
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,890
personal insight that describe what you

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in second thing was that</font>

280
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,840
face recognition helped a lot compared

281
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to just displaying the image so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

282
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,190
data analysis in the case of photos were

283
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,440
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very effective in the case of</font>

284
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">text we couldn't detect a significant</font>

285
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,320
difference but we also noted<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font>

286
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,230
close in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> percentages but we</font>

287
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,600
can't say much there so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

288
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,190
developed the far-reaching insights and

289
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,650
we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in an actual store so</font>

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">previous seal is a store as acts like a</font>

everything within this new permission

model now the third thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the last</font>

306
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,040
things that can we infer something about

307
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,529
developers behavior based on based on

308
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,890
previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> seed we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collected actually an</font>

309
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:50,200
app data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we ask users to grant us</font>

310
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,120
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list of apps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we</font>

311
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,000
analyze this and analyze<font color="#CCCCCC"> data set to</font>

312
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,790
discern into the developers behavior the

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,210
first outcome here was that all over

314
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">forty percent of apps on Chrome Web</font>

315
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,980
Store changed their access level with

316
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,680
time from<font color="#E5E5E5"> partial to full access or the</font>

317
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,120
reverse actually ninety-four percent

318
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,520
changed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> partial to full access and</font>

319
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,589
six percent the opposite way how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we</font>

320
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,620
find that actually when users install

321
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,300
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's recorded in there when it's</font>

322
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,820
recorded whether the app at that time

323
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,390
was partial or full access and we have

324
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,760
we had users installing the same app so

325
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">we so for some users was partial and for</font>

326
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,920
some users was full then we checked what

327
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,020
it is now and then we knew whether the

328
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,469
app has changed from full to partial

329
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:43,240
partial to full another finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that</font>

330
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:45,130
users was that apps that are outside the

331
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,440
chrome store tend to request full access

332
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,920
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than apps inside the chrome</font>

333
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">store the store as expected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I acts as a</font>

334
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">deterrent to developers actually in</font>

335
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:01,089
order to not request full access that's

336
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,800
some explanation we came up with that

337
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:07,680
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to the third research</font>

338
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,150
question ok so just conclusion finally

339
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,630
transparency dashboards are away we

340
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,720
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to allow users to allow</font>

341
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,540
users to know what apps has had

342
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,519
have accessed from their data and when

343
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:25,839
so this acts as also a deterrent for

344
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:29,319
developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to misbehave okay so this is</font>

345
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,269
my talk these are the conclusions to

346
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,490
third of the apps on cloud on Google

347
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,259
Drive where over privileged users data

348
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,360
as a language<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is communication is</font>

349
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,970
effective and developers are actually

350
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,139
escalating their permissions thank you

351
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,139
and if you have question
