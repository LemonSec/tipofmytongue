1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
thank you very much it's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,290
I give a talk being cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two</font>

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,420
microphones so I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is going to</font>

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,280
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so I'm very excited to be here</font>

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,429
at Pet Center presents a joint verb is

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,320
my PhD student you poo on measuring the

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,390
value and explaining the value of

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,010
interdependent privacy and epidural

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,289
context so a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of studies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,230
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> told us and informed us that</font>

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,750
users are concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usage of</font>

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,549
information in<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party context and</font>

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,600
clear this is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is relevant</font>

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:40,169
also in the social app economy such as

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,140
we exhibit them on facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> or also on</font>

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in mobile context so however you also</font>

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,550
observe that is that not only data about

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,280
the individual that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,260
sharing decision is becoming available

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,539
to these<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party app providers but</font>

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,190
also data about others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,770
essentially the topic of our talk and

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we describe as</font>

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:03,329
interdependent privacy so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,729
also stress at this point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,790
our work is about situations that are

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,280
not collaborative in nature so here one

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,490
individual makes decisions about data

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,909
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mother's so let me illustrate that</font>

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,169
on an example which gets to our context

31
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,110
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume there's an individual</font>

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,650
called mark he is interested in a

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,780
particular application that has certain

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,549
permissions associated with it on the

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,100
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their permissions that affects</font>

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,170
mark himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other hand their</font>

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,390
permissions about other individuals if

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,509
mark decides to install this particular

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,229
application then he will not only share

40
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,060
his own information<font color="#CCCCCC"> but also the photos</font>

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the birthday information about all</font>

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,189
his friends which your marks case would

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,990
be thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different individuals so</font>

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,720
in this information then is transferred

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,399
outside of the context<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the platform</font>

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,860
provider whether that is a social

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,540
network or mobile platform and in this

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,539
case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example it could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

49
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">online game providers so when you talk</font>

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,819
about interdependent privacy we first

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,340
try to nail the concept down a little

52
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,569
bit with theoretical foundation and what

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,120
helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> us say is</font>

54
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:18,030
look into behavioral economic theory and

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,780
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that community one already has</font>

56
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,849
established for a long time this concept

57
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,530
of other regarding preferences which

58
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,738
essentially means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not only</font>

59
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at your own utility but also</font>

60
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,579
internalizing to various different

61
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,319
degrees the utility of other individuals

62
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:38,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in our context this would mean that</font>

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,760
you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reason about whether the</font>

64
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,560
other individuals would be accepting<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">your sharing decision of the information</font>

66
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the epidural context so if you're</font>

67
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,590
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in this literature on</font>

68
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,629
distributive preferences you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can for</font>

69
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,579
example look at behavioral economics

70
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,010
papers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of ultimatum games</font>

71
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,230
or dictator games it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

72
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">so building on this literature they have</font>

73
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,149
been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of models being proposed</font>

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,040
first by be shocked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chia and 2013 on</font>

75
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,510
interdependent privacy and then we

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,370
followed this up with our own study

77
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,000
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always heard about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

78
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,459
papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> were well how does it actually</font>

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand up to the empirics so how much do</font>

80
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,040
people actually really care about other

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,108
people's privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in practice so this</font>

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,418
motivated<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to complement our economic</font>

83
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:26,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeling work also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then with a</font>

84
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,040
behavioral study to actually fill these

85
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,689
models with life so the concrete

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,698
research question that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked here are</font>

87
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,948
then clearly associated this is

88
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,019
behavioral concepts on the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand we</font>

89
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,569
want to first establish well to which

90
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,459
degree do really individuals value the

91
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,909
information of others in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,879
sharing decision and social app adoption

context<font color="#E5E5E5"> as somewhat related a question</font>

94
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,379
that we also try to answers by the

95
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,209
important contextual factors also then

96
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,149
influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of valuation and</font>

97
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,269
finally the core part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper to be</font>

98
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,479
presented here pets is to also<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font>

99
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:08,430
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuations as exhibited buys</font>

100
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:11,549
individuals in the epidural scenario so

101
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part of the question we can</font>

102
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,320
answer by using methodology that has

103
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,599
been established over<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,430
the marketing context it's called

105
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:24,270
conjoint analysis and what it actually

106
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,970
allows us to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make users or</font>

107
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,859
participate

108
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,440
for consumers make decisions about

complex product band bundles that

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,020
consists out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different attributes and</font>

in the specific methodology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

113
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,720
essentially different expressions of a

social app with different kind of

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,700
attributes and after this ranking

decisions have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking place the</font>

method methodology of conjoint analysis

118
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,729
allows us and to deconstruct these

119
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,070
different rankings and come up with

120

numerical part of utilities for these

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,180
different attributes and the associated

122
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,539
levels now this allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

123
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,430
essentially by picking useful attributes

124
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,750
and associated levels to answer that

125
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,500
essentially the question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

126
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,170
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> after so more concretely the</font>

127
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,620
four dimensions that are relevant in our

128
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,510
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> are price which helps us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then to</font>

translate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other three dimensions</font>

130
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,890
also in the domain of monetary

131
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,659
evaluations the second dimension is

132
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">network popularity which is kind of a</font>

friend internal measure of network

information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends privacy so to</font>

which degree you share<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a care</font>

about the sharing of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> individuals</font>

140
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,419
that are associated with you and let's

141
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,510
drill a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper into these two</font>

142
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:49,000
attributes within these attributes we

have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first level</font>

third level there's very comprehensive

149
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,099
information shared about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you or about</font>

150
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,890
others here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up some excel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

151
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,380
the exact explanation of how we explain

152
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,409
basic and full profile information in

153
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,760
the context of friends information

154
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so having essentially</font>

155
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,719
established<font color="#E5E5E5"> these different attributes</font>

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,090
we can then essentially go into the

157
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,650
ranking task and they are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

158
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,530
approaches on how they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be actually</font>

159
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">visualized the online survey package</font>

160
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,330
which we used allows for essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

161
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,120
following ranking interface where you

162
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,889
can essentially drag and drop these

163
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,870
different expressions of

164
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,030
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different apps with associated</font>

165
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,789
attributes and levels so that eventually

166
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,840
it then resembles your preference over

167
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:49,240
these different versions right so this

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">is essentially our approach to answer</font>

169
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,840
the first research question the second

170
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,699
research question was about context and

171
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,498
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing here is essentially</font>

172
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,080
manipulating the instructions document

173
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:01,270
that we gave to individuals before they

174
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,919
gave came into the ranking task and we

175
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,479
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have essentially a contextual</font>

176
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:05,948
manipulation that seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

177
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,169
relevant for the context of

178
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,900
interdependent privacy so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

179
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,938
<font color="#CCCCCC">hand what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are then doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

180
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular scenario is to essentially</font>

181
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:17,949
manipulate whether the data collection

182
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,719
about users friends has actually any

183
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,849
impact on the functionality of the app

184
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:23,740
so on treatment number one we

185
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:25,930
essentially describe a scenario where

186
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,819
the collection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is early the band</font>

187
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,400
through the purpose of the app in

188
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,409
scenario number two we have the outcome

189
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,799
where actually the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> really has an</font>

190
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:37,779
impact on the functionality of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f we</font>

191
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,060
included<font color="#CCCCCC"> that instruction with these two</font>

192
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,550
statements so keep in mind again this is

193
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,889
explicitly targeting the friends

194
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,259
information not your own information all

195
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,089
right so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results that you see</font>

196
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,520
are based on the study that we actually

197
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:53,169
then deployed on Mechanical Turk if you

198
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,210
want to see all the details about how we

199
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,339
deployed it the demographics etcetera

200
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,289
please take a look at the research paper

201
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:01,419
so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I move on to the third</font>

202
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,699
research question I take a stop here and

203
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:05,948
present you some results about the first

204
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,500
two research questions regarding the

205
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:13,479
evaluation and the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

206
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,279
contextual variation so what we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

207
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,409
are two graphs the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand graph</font>

208
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,389
relates to treatment number one through

209
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,680
the over<font color="#CCCCCC"> levante data collection on the</font>

210
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,139
right side we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have relevant data</font>

211
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,899
collection we see three different rows

212
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:29,319
of three bucks each the last part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

213
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:31,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit small I will come to that we have</font>

214
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,209
here the basic information collected

215
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,140
both for for individuals and for their

216
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,359
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and here the full profile</font>

217
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,519
information for individuals and for the

218
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,290
friends and in the middle essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

219
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,110
see the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the two which</font>

220
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,099
highlights the more valuable information

221
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,769
given to

222
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,569
ians so what we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that well as</font>

223
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:55,759
expected the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more valuable and more</font>

224
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">comprehensive information becomes right</font>

225
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,050
so more the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> increases which is</font>

226
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,790
short on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the y-axis right so that makes</font>

227
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense what we are after is essentially</font>

228
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,680
establishing what happens actually with

229
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,990
in terms of the monetary value of

230
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,180
interdependent privacy and what we see

231
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is essentially the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same effect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

232
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,439
the more comprehensive information

233
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,180
becomes in both treatments also the

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,149
desert tendencies that the value

235
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually increases the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treatment effect</font>

236
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,199
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different context conditions</font>

237
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,359
is such that for basic profile

238
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:30,979
information full profile information we

239
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,649
indeed observe that individuals seem to

240
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,930
be reluctant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share information in the</font>

241
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,610
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> levante data context so the value</font>

242
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the information is getting high on</font>

243
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,110
this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> context but it's not</font>

244
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">consistent across all these different</font>

245
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,130
scenarios now<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's come to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last bar</font>

246
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,329
so the first observation is that

247
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,730
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value for your own</font>

248
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:55,880
information is typically significantly

249
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,189
higher than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you value for all your</font>

250
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">friends information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we also did was</font>

251
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:01,399
to collect from the individuals a

252
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,600
self-reported figure for how many

253
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,670
friends they have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their favorite</font>

254
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">social networking site and this is</font>

255
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,180
represented here essentially by the

256
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,620
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the average friends data so</font>

257
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,959
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you is that for the full</font>

258
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,540
profile information in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario of</font>

259
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">irrelevant data collection individuals</font>

260
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,029
exhibit the value of half a cent per in

261
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video and the scenario for relevant</font>

262
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:28,790
data collection so here it's half a cent

263
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,399
and here this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> set right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

264
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">relatively low so not only do we have</font>

265
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,269
the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that individuals Valley</font>

266
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,860
their own information<font color="#E5E5E5"> than all the</font>

267
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,970
information of all their friends but the

268
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,649
difference of course becomes much more

269
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,839
drastic if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually control for the</font>

270
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,480
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that is actually</font>

271
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,970
shared so now to the last research

272
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,910
question can be explained actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

273
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,579
findings with the help of additional

274
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,750
research studies what we did this was to

275
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,880
amend essentially our study was to come

276
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,280
prehensile survey which included<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

number of contracts<font color="#CCCCCC"> construction which</font>

278
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,949
we believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain these</font>

279
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,140
valuations for own privacy and privacy

280
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,680
of others so those includes for example

281

<font color="#E5E5E5">past the privacy invasion experiences</font>

privacy knowledge the trust in the app

283
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,420
providers concern for own privacy but

284
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,250
also concern for others privacy and in

285
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,349
particularly relevant for interdependent

privacy measure of social bonding a

social capital which essentially are

288
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,830
these in material resources that we

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">build through social interactions with</font>

broaden our mind get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to other</font>

news resources to other social circles

295
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,470
or in close knit relationships which can

296
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,479

really get us access to direct help or

298
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,950
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even monetary resources and so on</font>

299
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so forth so essentially conducting a</font>

300
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,750
survey based on these constructs we are

301
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,870
then able to conduct the<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font>

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">structural equation modeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,610
established software tool and to

304
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">establish a model of how we believe</font>

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">these control constructs relate to each</font>

306
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,080
other and then also test to which degree

307
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,670
actually these hypothesized

308
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,250

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">practice so conceptual model is as</font>

310
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,250
follows on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top path we have the path</font>

311
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,650
for the concern of own privacy and then

312
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,780
the valuation for own privacy and this

313
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,540
we believe is driven by experiences of

314
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,370
past privacy invasion and individuals

315
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,860
trust in the app providers with which

316
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,080
information is shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the bottom part</font>

317
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,360
we are particular interested whether

318
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,430
these measures of social capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,070
in material resources that he encumber

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,290
some ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build together with our</font>

321
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and acquaintances actually do</font>

322
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,270
have an impact then on how concerned

323
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,400
individuals are to invade the privacy of

324
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,370
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and then also this measure</font>

325
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,110
of friends privacy value and we also

326
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,480
believe that essentially the treatment

327
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,760
conditions have a moderating impact on

328
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,170
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of relationship so since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

329

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too much time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I cannot go</font>

330

<font color="#E5E5E5">into detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this hypothesis but these</font>

331
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,349
are our results

332
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,989
after running essentially our model

333
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,899
estimation the<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed finds the top part</font>

334
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the model being supported however</font>

335
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,130
surprisingly we do not find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

336
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,380
actually these resources that are

<font color="#CCCCCC">immaturely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build up with your friends</font>

338
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,360
and acquaintances have a significant

339
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,839
impact on this concern for other

340
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,120
people's privacy and eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> France</font>

341
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,040
privacy value we do however find for

both<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern that mentions that</font>

individuals concern for himself his own

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:46,200
data has an impact on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluation and</font>

concern for<font color="#E5E5E5"> others has an impact on the</font>

346
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,120
valuation of others data right so we

347
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:55,020
essentially can partially confirm this

348
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,779
model some of these measures give us

349
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,000
hope so<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed if we can elaborate and</font>

350
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,910
measure the concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> that individuals</font>

have about others<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sharing of data</font>

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,439
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> others and can from that</font>

353
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,779
extrapolate about the decisions then

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is already step forward so this</font>

355
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,189
brings me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the conclusions so this is</font>

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,100
essentially the first comprehensive

357
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:19,470
study to quantify and explain the value

358
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,220
of interdependent privacy however in the

359
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,380
specific context of epidural decisions

360
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,180
users vastly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll appreciate the</font>

361
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of information shared about their</font>

362
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,370
friends which leads essentially to this

363
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,470
very very low evaluations of the value

364
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,930
of the data remember this includes all

365
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,640
your friends photos that<font color="#CCCCCC"> birthday</font>

366
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,979
information very comprehensive data

367
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,800
about them nevertheless<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's valued and</font>

368
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,500
most of our scenarios at less as at less

369
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,260
than one cent right so we could describe

370

that individuals whether or not they're

371
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,069
reasonable about their own information

372
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're certainly privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> egoists when</font>

373
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,570
it comes to sharing decisions about

00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:02,220
their friends data and the final slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

379
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:16,709
of the results are really at the edge of

380
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,149
statistical significance and perhaps

381
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,189
this mimics really what's going on

00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">andrea life that we see a lot of over</font>
