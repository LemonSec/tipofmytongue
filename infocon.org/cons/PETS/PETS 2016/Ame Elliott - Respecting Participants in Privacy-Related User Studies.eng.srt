00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,549
super quick context around what simply

secure is we are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-profit our</font>

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,699
improve software by creating and

16

distributing free open resources we do

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,920
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> create code we do resources so if</font>

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,370
you only take one word from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk that</font>

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,190
word is resources here are our<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,170
tweet them share them break them fork

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,830
during this talk is give you a little

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of a teaser about why these</font>

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,100
resources can help you in your work and

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:22,770
then I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to shift the conversation</font>

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:28,350
into a more explicit discussion of

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:31,289
ethics and edge cases so last<font color="#E5E5E5"> December</font>

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,960
we did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> in context field work in New</font>

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,460
York this was looking at people in

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,189
Brownsville and harlem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to predominantly</font>

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,399
african-american communities about their

33
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,669
perceptions of privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and surveillance</font>

34
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:51,329
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone about</font>

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,340
how she uses mobile messaging from that

36
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,460
study three things came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,509
tweeted out a version of that I'm not

39
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,449
going to go into the findings and

40
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,670
outcomes beyond a quick teaser there are

41
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,399
additionally some resources that's the

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">keyword resources that you can all use</font>

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,970
in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own work and then finally this</font>

44
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,890
community disguise

45
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shin as a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought starter for</font>

46
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,140
the next thing so in terms of what came

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,870
out of it when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we met with people we</font>

48
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,529
heard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> surveillance is inevitable</font>

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and privacy is impossible so at the time</font>

50
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:33,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this research in</font>

51
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">December of 2015 the u.s. conversation</font>

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,410
about race class policing violence black

53
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,090
lives mattering was not at the same

54
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,329
place that it is now it's been a very

55
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,800
intense and wrenching summer in the

56
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,840
United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States so this is turning out for</font>

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,120
really awful reasons to be more timely

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,390
perhaps now but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's important</font>

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,660
to to recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in all kinds of</font>

60
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,500
communities there are people who are

61
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,750
disproportionately targeted by

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,670
surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

63
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,610
ways to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they are</font>

64
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,679
represented in these conversations key

65
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,990
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take away is these communities</font>

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,209
have technologists and cryptographers in

67
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,480
them crypto<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harlem doing some amazing</font>

68
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:21,450
work there many other organizations the

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,820
people in this study did not identify as

70
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,160
activists and they did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify as</font>

71
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:31,410
technologists so that's just a really

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,660
important piece of of context so one way

73
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,630
in which this in person qualitative

74
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,970
fieldwork helped was reframing some of

75
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,250
these narratives so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mobile</font>

76
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone store / gold jewelry store and</font>

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,510
harlem and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> including this photo</font>

78
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,519
because this is an example of a place

79
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,579
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for tech support where</font>

80
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">people go to pay their bills and this is</font>

81
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,620
one touch point in a service economy

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,720
where the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this study had an</font>

83
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,630
adversarial relationship with their

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,090
mobile phone carrier they believed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

85
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,579
the carrier had filled their phones with

86
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,170
malware and bloatware which i think is a

87
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,890
reasonable assumption if you're talking

88
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a low-cost android handset in that</font>

89
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,929
the carrier was trying to push software

90
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,450
to break their phone because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

91
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,608
more money so they were speaking of

92
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,430
scenarios a lot like ransomware and

93
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,469
malware and incomplete commercial lay

94
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,910
language

95
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carriers want to break your phone to</font>

96
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,940
force you to upgrade so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

97
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,609
teaser of the study let's talk resources

98
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:38,880
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been so gratified to see such</font>

99
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,970
enthusiasm and so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting human</font>

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,640
factors tracks euro<font color="#CCCCCC"> usac on monday and</font>

101
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,250
all kinds of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing user studies</font>

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,680
that is so important everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

103
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,600
saying here is in support of doing more

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that of getting more people doing it</font>

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,340
and of doing it better so just I'm going

106
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do my own kind of survey to take a</font>

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,390
sense of who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the audience who here</font>

108
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,840
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually done some form of user</font>

109
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:07,830
study or usability study a few people

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great are you and organizations</font>

111
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,890
have some kind of process for a consent

112
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,910
for human subjects research or some kind

113
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:21,870
of human subjects<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol couple okay</font>

114
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,090
so good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you that don't know</font>

115
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,130
there's a long history both in the US

116
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,640
and globally of people conducting

117
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,250
experiments on humans everything from

118
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,169
you know Stanley Milgram and other kinds

119
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,080
of like psychological biological

120
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:40,099
biomedical research can have negative

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,060
consequences on people many

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,010
technologists come from a point of view

123
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,900
that like relative to brain surgery

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,390
there's very little bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can happen</font>

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,849
to you for participating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a study I</font>

126
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,430
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to gently suggest that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

127
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,050
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true we have seen some excellent</font>

128
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,030
strides in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the journalistic community</font>

129
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,490
for example around the importance of

130
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,619
protecting sources so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to plan a</font>

131
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,410
small seed that some of our more

132
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,790
vulnerable participants may need similar

133
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">measures to protect them so if you're</font>

134
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,220
doing the user research in an academic

135
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,130
context you may have this committee for

136
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,620
human subjects protocol document that

137
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,050
you require everyone to sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not</font>

138
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,000
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> user facing language and it sets up</font>

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,620
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird power dynamic where</font>

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,510
you're explicitly telling the person

141
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are interviewing that you're</font>

142
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,860
experimenting on them I mean that's

143
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,050
that's what that document says I believe

144
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,539
it's an important safeguard<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do</font>

145
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">better one example resource we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

146
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,229
do better is this participants

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights this is a small and a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">text this is a commercial to say hey get</font>

149
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,760
on github and look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and let us know</font>

150
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

151
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking on more consumer facing mindset</font>

152
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,680
again this was research done in New York

153
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how this will extend</font>

154
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,810
globally where people that we spoke with

155
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that our participants mostly worked in</font>

156
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,270
retail jobs they were super clear about

157
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,099
what complaining to a supervisor meant

158
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,599
that was just like a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

159
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,830
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it had happened to them they</font>

160
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,290
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was something that they</font>

161
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,599
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it sets of a very different</font>

162
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,770
power dynamic when I come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and I</font>

163
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,380
say hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Amy Elliott my boss is scout</font>

164
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,390
Brody this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is her contact information if</font>

165
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,640
something doesn't go right in this

166
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,099
interview you can get in touch with her

167
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,560
and complain so that's already kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

168
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,650
just destabilizing that and in some ways

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,120
where people know they can refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

170
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,130
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions they can get up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

171
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,310
leave they'll still be paid they must

172
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,340
explicitly opt<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the collection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

173
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,990
data like photos videos etc many of

174
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,849
these points<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the same points that</font>

175
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,630
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented in different language and</font>

176
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:56,380
existing documents ok the next thing

177
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,969
model releases that just the word model

178
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,760
release is already kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of provocative</font>

179
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,370
and again i want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> express the warmest</font>

180
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,680
enthusiasm in the strongest solidarity

181
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,720
for the academic research that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've seen</font>

182
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">all week it's been great and inspiring</font>

183
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,570
I've seen large samples I've seen

184
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,450
statistics I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of things</font>

185
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,730
my role is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a design director I'm a user</font>

186
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,860
experience designer I'm a practitioner

187
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,980
I'm not an academic it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font>

188
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,200
social science research we do not audio

189
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,300
record or a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> record our interviews</font>

190
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,348
so that's an important distinction

191
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,599
because in some cases just the act of

192
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,520
participating in academic research and

193
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,310
doing publishing may lead you to feel

194
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,468
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must audio record everything</font>

195
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,689
transcribe it have one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> more people</font>

196
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,060
coded and in some cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might make</font>

197
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense but I just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make space in</font>

198
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,199
this room amongst you all to question if

199
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,400
that needs to be the case

200
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,350
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation so if you're working</font>

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">with more privacy conscious people there</font>

202
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">are many reasons why they would not</font>

203
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:05,949
consent to photo or audio or videos so

204
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,079
we take handwritten notes I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in</font>

205
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,700
interviews where I took no notes I just

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">listened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people and then went away</font>

207
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,620
later and wrote things down later in

208
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case everyone in the participated</font>

209
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this new york study it was fine with</font>

210
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,359
handwritten notes and then we gave

211
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,220
people an option to opt into some form

212
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,920
of photography so photography<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

213
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,350
important tool for building empathy for

214
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,280
bringing bits of people's context with

215
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,380
them into other kinds of places so i

216
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,300
have given longer a different versions

217
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,700
of this talk less focused on the ethics

218
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,219
and more specifically focused on the

219
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,400
outcomes but this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> image that I</font>

220
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,080
know if I see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 10 or 15 years I</font>

221
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,449
will know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story behind it is</font>

222
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I know that is because I've</font>

223
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing this kind of research for</font>

224
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,220
about 15 years and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see images from</font>

225
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,960
studies i did in 2001 a photograph of a

226
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,210
participant and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

227
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,520
conversation so the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i want to</font>

228
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,800
plant with you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York dunkin donuts</font>

229
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,199
is a big deal like<font color="#CCCCCC"> New Yorkers are super</font>

230
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,560
into dunkin donuts they're super into

231
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,510
their coffee people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

232
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,189
saving money especially at the holiday

233
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,290
time this took place<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit before</font>

234
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Christmas this is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

235
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,480
participants that we met her in this

236
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,670
dunkin donuts she's a big user of DD

237
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,220
perks which is an app you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see advertised</font>

238
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,589
over her shoulder it's an android<font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font>

239
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,080
and essentially it's taking all of her

240
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,960
location information and her<font color="#CCCCCC"> alba</font>

241
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,100
contacts from her address books

242
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,610
literally for the price of a cup of

243
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">coffee i mean that's that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality</font>

244
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can look at the android app</font>

245
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,800
permissions they're hugely popular in

246
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,060
the most recent statistics of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

247
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,430
they've been downloaded if you look

248
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,319
across a range of fast food restaurants

249
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,630
it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are doing this</font>

250
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,600
there's not a lot of conversation around

251
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,670
exactly like how those mean she is still

252
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,170
be motivated by saving money this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

253
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,449
turn her mind just the digital version

254
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,060
of the punch card where can't you get

255
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,220
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 by 10 whatever cups of</font>

256
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,530
coffee get a coffee free there's this

257
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,240
whole gifting virtual currency element

258
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,589
and that's why she's done this there's a

259
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,750
clear value proposition<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

260
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,000
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of hey photos can be useful</font>

261
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,250
for storytelling how do you get them in

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,910
ways that are respectful our default is

263
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,210
no photography at all but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can opt</font>

264
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,280
into non-personally identifiable

265
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,260
photography or even something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

266
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,030
identifiable and to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

267
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were clear on what we were</font>

268
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:43,240
talking about we shared examples from

269
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,620
the humans of New York Instagram feed so

270
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,470
i don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are familiar with</font>

271
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,140
this it its controversial in some ways

272
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,620
and cool in some ways this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

273
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,630
kind of interesting this is a guy who

274
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,040
had been working at the UN to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

275
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,870
rights lawyer and became so

276
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,150
disillusioned that he decided to open a

277
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,330
bar like this is literally a story that

278
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,030
he's telling he's not named but you see

279
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,040
his face all of our participants were

280
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,560
familiar with humans of New York or<font color="#CCCCCC"> honi</font>

281
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,069
is it's called and they understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

282
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,569
it meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey if you can sense I</font>

283
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:21,790
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share photos of your face</font>

284
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,890
like this with the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not</font>

285
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,599
name you you and I can leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

286
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,180
interview you can disappear back into

287
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,670
New York I don't know your name<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

288
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">know how to find you our participant</font>

289
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,040
recruiter handled all that information

290
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,870
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in sharing this this</font>

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:49,630
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places so let's see here if</font>

293
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,250
people sign a model release take a

294
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,400
couple minutes at the end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them</font>

295
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,480
look good this is an in-progress

296
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
interview shot that's like pretty

297
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,590
mediocre like yes interview happen

298
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,850
that's me that's the participant the man

299
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,710
with the headphones you see use the

300
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,440
example image from humans of New York

301
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:08,260
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the photograph that we took at</font>

302
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's intended to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a powerful</font>

compelling photographic shot from a

lower

305
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,860
if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there's a</font>

306
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,280
ton of stuff on the world right now

307
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,500
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to do photography you know</font>

308
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,240
your participants deserve respect if

309
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,980
they consent to this you should make

310
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,720
them look good oops sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

311
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,130
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have conversations so</font>

312
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump into some of the</font>

313
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,420
questions not sure where my toolbar<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

314
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,330
still there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok these are examples of</font>

315
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:41,370
non-identifiable photography feet shoes

316
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,870
purses nails phones it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

317
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,320
interesting to me when I seemed the

318
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:49,530
mcdonalds app as in this lower right

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,960
corner is occupying such a prominent

320
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,689
place on someone's home screen but

321
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,190
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with these photos who is</font>

322
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,250
this person should<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have given</font>

323
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,710
consent an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of how people may be</font>

324
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,090
harmed these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some young</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> men from a</font>

325
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,250
group interview we did and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

326
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about how the police in New York</font>

327
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,090
are impersonating their friends on

328
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,130
Facebook and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are then</font>

329
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,940
subsequently being arrested based on

330
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,230
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook Likes so in that context</font>

331
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,760
there's a ton of reasons you wouldn't

332
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,310
want to instrument someone's computer

333
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,880
and sniff and grab all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their for</font>

334
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,260
example Facebook Likes so to launch its

335
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,320
ended the discussion here a few

336
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,290
provocations should this photo require a

337
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,330
release does it matter if that's him

338
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,280
does it matter if that's his dead

339
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,400
brother does it matter if that's his

340
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,079
celebrity I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example of</font>

341
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,000
an edge case I know some computer

342
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,460
scientists are super<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about edge</font>

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,010
cases so think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

344
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,520
of an edge case about sharing the screen

345
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,620
and what what should be on that also

346
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,010
this study that I use as a case study

347
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,010
was 100% qualitative<font color="#E5E5E5"> small-scale in</font>

348
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,740
person this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also true on the quant</font>

349
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,660
side I know the tour UX team has been

350
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,690
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really interesting thinking</font>

351
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,699
around non-identifiable metrics there is

352
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,370
a whole ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> around how apps work</font>

353
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,530
how the web works around tracking but

354
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,660
what does it mean we as a community do

355
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,510
user research with people who have no

356
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,370
problem installing logging apps have no

357
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,300
problem consenting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be surveilled if</font>

358
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,209
you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with mechana</font>

359
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">Turk you've said please instrument my</font>

360
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:29,010
computer record it all that's fine

361
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,870
that's how I earn my money I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

362
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,790
you can still do good research and that

363
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,980
contacts that it does is good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

364
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,469
explicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the limits so</font>

365
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,480
alternatives how confident are we that

366
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,060
their behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mechanical</font>

367
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,040
turquoise extends to others and finally

368
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,660
are your people representative what's

369
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,510
the threat model how would they be

370
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,870
harmed so with that resources resources

371
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:54,300
resources I think you all get involved

372
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,980
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slack channel and happy to</font>

373
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,979
take questions and discussion
