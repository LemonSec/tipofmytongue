1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
thank you good morning I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,689
as well thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk I</font>

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,360
know I have three competing talks right

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,179
now and there's also the competing sleep

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,860
factor so thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for coming</font>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,719
to my talk I'm going to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,970
you about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all realistically attacking</font>

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,550
tour with Joseph fingerprinting I'm tawa

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,349
I'm from I recently joined a humble

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,090
University of Santa technology and this

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,830
was work done when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a PhD students</font>

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,750
with my supervisor Ian Goldberg and

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,390
university at what to do Ian's the one

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:35,340
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there with the hair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so</font>

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,649
the most important word of this title

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,899
here is the word on now if I were to

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,879
remove the word on then it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,710
if I had the paper that claimed I could

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,530
realistically attacked or which website

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,210
fingerprinting now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't the reason</font>

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,370
why this is important is because there's

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,710
no way for me to really claim I finally

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a realistic attack against out</font>

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,670
against tour and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the</font>

25
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,680
nature of website fingerprinting as a

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,809
classification problem you have a

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,120
classifier you get a output<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

28
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,229
really confirm if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> output is true or</font>

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,149
not and so this the best we can do here

30
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,400
so we can really just set up a test

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,260
environment where we know the ground

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,060
truth and hopefully the test environment

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,070
is similar to the view environment and

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,509
that's why this is important issue maybe

35
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,250
there are differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the test</font>

36
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,259
environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it Andrey environment</font>

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,299
that we aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure about which may</font>

38
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,189
cause accuracy to be much lower than we

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,020
thought now another<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do this would</font>

40
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">be for me to really just go out and</font>

41
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,860
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real tor users but since I'm</font>

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">not from a certain university I can't do</font>

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's move on so website</font>

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,299
fingerprinting so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is reps I</font>

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,200
fingerprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be you might be</font>

46
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,520
asking website fingerprinting is this as

47
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,560
can be explained from this simple

48
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,420
problem there's this client and this

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,799
client is visiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page it's a web</font>

50
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,390
page because there's a spider's web with

51
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,560
a piece of paper stuck on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

52
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,759
the client wants to load the page so

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,829
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a package sequence</font>

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,689
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be outgoing packets for us</font>

55
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,699
and get requests and data it's going to

56
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">be incoming data as well and the</font>

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is what if there's an attacker</font>

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,690
here the attacker is close to the client

59
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attacker is local the attacker is a</font>

60
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,810
passive in shopper and

61
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,060
what can the attacker really see this

62
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,249
simple answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this is if you're using</font>

63
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,439
encryption then your tiger can't see the

64
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:22,299
clear text if you're using proxies then

65
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,280
the tiger also can't see the destination

66
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,780
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be using both of those to</font>

67
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,120
make sure the attacker can't see much

68
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,799
except your identity and so for example

69
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,569
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using toward and your tiger</font>

70
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,430
shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see much at all but</font>

71
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,988
the more complicated answer is because

72
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">of its a fingerprinting because of</font>

73
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,099
traffic analysis the attacker can

74
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,620
actually still guess where you're going

75
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:44,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">because where you're going is going to</font>

76
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,700
affect the traffic analysis and how do

77
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:49,359
we defeat such an attacker how do we pop

78
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,040
this balloon well people have been

79
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:54,069
suggesting one way to do so would be to

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,168
improve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> defenses would be to enhance</font>

81
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,480
our currently known privacy enhancing

82
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:01,540
technologies or otherwise known<font color="#CCCCCC"> as pets</font>

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,310
to pop this balloon so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why this</font>

84
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a balloon phim talk this just for</font>

85
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,000
this joke there's no other reason why

86
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,139
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to we're stuck with the</font>

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,379
balloon<font color="#CCCCCC"> team talk now I hope it's</font>

88
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:14,230
someone's birthday today so the pets

89
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:16,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">will also cover up the page partially or</font>

90
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,388
40 in some way so that it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

91
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,650
to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the pages but those</font>

92
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,909
tend to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive and people</font>

93
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,799
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just adopt them</font>

94
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,418
willy-nilly because another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> py be</font>

95
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,639
wondering is maybe those attacks aren't

96
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,370
as scary as we thought maybe they're

97
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,030
just kind of lame ish maybe they're just

98
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,319
not very useful in the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

99
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,329
because there are legitimate concerns

100
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,220
about some of the differences between

101
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">the testbed that we're talking about and</font>

102
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,620
a real scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's look at what</font>

103
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,900
this test bed is this test bed involves

104
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,120
a simple evaluation procedure we are

105
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit some webpages we're going</font>

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,299
to record package sequences for those

107
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,470
web pages and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

108
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,120
training testing now this sounds very

109
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple and direct but it turns out</font>

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,280
there's problems with every step of this

111
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,900
procedure what if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font>

112
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,729
clients do more than just visit pages

113
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,769
right what if they're all so for example

114
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,329
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video in the background and</font>

115
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,979
when we record package sequences we

116
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,709
serve record packet sequence we start

117
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:13,389
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we end but how do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know when</font>

118
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,639
a packet sequence should really end in

119
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,320
the real world right and for training<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

120
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,060
testing there's this problem of what if

121
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,500
the training set gets too old how often

122
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,690
do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the training set</font>

123
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,880
and it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> their previous work</font>

124
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,770
caresses her ass at<font color="#CCCCCC"> El</font>

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,330
so you have shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all of those are</font>

126
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">sufficient to make website</font>

127
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,050
fingerprinting attacks go to near zero

128
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,550
accuracy so we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve those</font>

129
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,150
problems to claim that website

130
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,260
fingerprinting can be realistic so we're

131
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divide those into sweet</font>

132
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,620
realistic problems there's going to be

133
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,210
it's going to be noisy data and then

134
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,920
splitting and then training set

135
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,630
maintenance and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

136
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,630
about those issues in this order now in

137
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,659
the paper interesting nine the paper is

138
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,800
saturating the reverse order so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

139
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,500
that's going to be the difference with

140
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,270
the paper and we since this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

141
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">long talk we want to remind people which</font>

142
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,630
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it we are on so we're just going</font>

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add a little bar to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom left</font>

144
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,380
that goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so first</font>

145
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,540
of all we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about noisy</font>

146
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,460
data how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> give is no see data in a</font>

147
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,350
realistic scenario by noisy data I don't

148
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,419
mean the classification noisy data which

149
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,110
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just incorrect labels what I mean as</font>

150
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,820
noise for example background music that

151
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,480
you're loading in one browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

152
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,860
baby's first browser versus 0.01 you're

153
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,420
loading it in one browser and then you

154
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,670
start a new tab and then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

155
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">something else you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at dogs</font>

156
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,710
now so the question is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on so the data is to incoming and</font>

158
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,669
you're also now pressing press on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

159
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">page that isn't using a transparent</font>

160
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:42,010
image so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you going to what is</font>

161
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,470
the attacker really able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

162
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,700
that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

163
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,150
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now there's a lot of</font>

164
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,159
noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this data and what this shows</font>

165
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,330
up in the attackers data set is the

166
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,770
attacker is going to see some noise

167
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,330
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the original page</font>

168
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,359
and the attacker is going to see this

169
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,550
combined addition of those two and the

170
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,470
attacker has already trained on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

171
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,870
of pages the attacker doesn't read know

172
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,130
about the noise and so there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

173
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,840
be of large difference between a

174
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,400
training set and the testing set as it

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,229
turns out this is very much sufficient

176
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,190
for the Tigers accuracy to be very low

177
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:17,830
and this depends on how how what the

178
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">noise rate is how much noise there is we</font>

179
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,650
can draw a little graph here those are

180
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,260
two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> website opening attacks</font>

181
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,390
published very recently and you can see

182
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for both the y-axis is the decrease</font>

183
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,479
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the true positive rate so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

184
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,580
serve they flatten out just because

185
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,370
they're actually has reached nearly zero

186
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,099
at the end and you can see that annoys

187
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,140
cells around

188
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 to 20 30 noises per second is enough</font>

189
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,260
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the accuracy to start chopping</font>

190
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,820
really drastically for both of those

191
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,469
attacks so as it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

192
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,480
noise for example like videos like

193
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,770
multimedia and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to exceed this</font>

194
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,300
number of cells per second and it's

195
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make those accuracy by the shop</font>

196
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,280
so how do we do with this here's an idea

197
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,570
let's say your tiger sees this the

198
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,609
attacker is going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess what</font>

199
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the noises and remove that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

200
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,750
packet sequence and the attacker is

201
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,430
going to guess that this is the page

202
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,450
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to identify and then they</font>

203
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,490
use the standard classification

204
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,900
technique to identify this as it turns

205
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,820
out the accuracy of this is nearly zero

206
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,130
i'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you any values</font>

207
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,930
because it's embarrassingly low it's not

208
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good idea and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why is</font>

209
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,520
because there are two big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with</font>

210
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,130
this no sequences are not actually

211
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really regular you notice that what we</font>

212
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">are trying to guess noise all we can</font>

213
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">really do is try to get something</font>

214
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,380
regular but no sequences are not very

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,360
regular and they very relatively quickly

216
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,180
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of variance in how the</font>

217
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,030
noise rate is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work so that's</font>

218
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,250
not good and to top<font color="#E5E5E5"> to top it off noise</font>

219
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,099
can sometimes look like this this is

220
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,260
noise this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the number of paca soda</font>

221
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,140
per second over a period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

222
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">loading</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> music noise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

223
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,039
non-standard so try to remove a certain

224
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,270
number cells per second it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

225
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,580
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going to work very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

226
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,599
and any disturbance you make to the

227
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,060
original sequence is going to

228
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">significantly chop the accuracy so</font>

229
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,300
that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea we can't read</font>

230
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,299
just remove noise from noisy package

231
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,830
sequences well here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another idea</font>

232
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,830
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how about instead</font>

233
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,229
of training on the page on the original

234
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,210
page set what if we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> train on the</font>

235
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,710
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> with noise we just trained on the</font>

236
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,359
noisy set so that our training<font color="#CCCCCC"> set and</font>

237
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,010
testing set are more similar to each

238
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,560
other now of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assumption here</font>

239
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,150
is the attacker can do this as in the

240
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,680
attacker can figure out what noise you

241
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,409
have and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> added to their own</font>

242
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,330
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> set but if we can allow this</font>

243
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,789
assumption it turns out that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

244
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,050
much better accuracy we have restored

245
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,880
our true positive rate to somewhere

246
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,890
between fifty to seventy percent which

247
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
is not too bad at all the false positive

248
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">rates still know if we can tolerate a</font>

249
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
false positive rate a higher false

250
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,120
positive rate than your pulse rate can

251
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,580
go higher as well so that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can</font>

252
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,870
deal with noisy data and this noisy data

253
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,750
is very

254
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,610
very loud is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we set the noise right</font>

255
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,490
here to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal to the page loading</font>

256
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,110
rate so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really show that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

257
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,640
can deal with a lot of noise and that's

258
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,279
happening in the background so that's

259
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,779
nice data let's move on to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

260
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,850
splitting what is the splitting problem

261
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,130
to put it simply the spreading point

262
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,320
problem is the following how many web

263
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,120
pages did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client client load in this</font>

264
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,430
packet sequence<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that seems like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

265
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,170
really difficult question to answer how

266
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,989
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell that so we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

267
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,610
about how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell that so there are</font>

268
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> three sub problems to this</font>

269
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,850
problem here there's large time gap

270
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,200
problem there's the zero time get

271
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,360
problem and there's a negative time<font color="#CCCCCC"> gap</font>

272
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,980
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this describes a time</font>

273
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,110
gap between the two package sequences

274
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,210
that we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to split if there's a</font>

275
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,070
large tank gap it's easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

276
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,950
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and it gets harder down</font>

277
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,540
the track so those are correspond to

278
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,130
realistic activities for large<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tangail</font>

279
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,390
you know the page you read it you have

280
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,250
some think time and you load the next

281
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,900
page 40 time gap you load it and you

282
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,640
click while it's still loading for a

283
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,990
negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> time gap you load it you load</font>

284
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,870
the page but then there's a new tab

285
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,040
while you're already loading so um

286
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,750
that's that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very difficult to</font>

287
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,029
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we have solutions for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,589
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> four we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

289
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,350
splitting but as it turns out for the

290
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:06,120
negative time gap we the accuracies can

291
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,470
be very low so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear what we</font>

292
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,990
can do here so that's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

293
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,120
unsolved so large time get what are we

294
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,410
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here if there's a large time it's</font>

295
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,790
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple if there's a large time gap</font>

296
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,339
between two package sequences we make a

297
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,050
rule if its larger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain gamma</font>

298
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,110
sort of number<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just say we're going</font>

299
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,880
to split it right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why</font>

300
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,920
choosing this is very important is if

301
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,630
you're choosing<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly then we've not</font>

302
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,250
split property and so we might have to

303
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,200
package sequences<font color="#E5E5E5"> combined together or</font>

304
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,270
we might have a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pegasus package</font>

305
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,620
you can split into two places and for

306
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,480
both of those classification is going to

307
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,080
be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult so you want to choose</font>

308
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,570
this properly as it turns out we can set

309
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,600
the rule to be if there is no packets

310
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,150
for one second then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do a</font>

311
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,160
split here and as it turns out this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

312
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,199
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little negative effect on known</font>

313
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,180
packet sequences it just with known

314
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,430
package sequences we just don't have a

315
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,010
pack of sequence that has that that gap

316
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,810
and it deals with most of the issue

317
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,010
right if you think if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading a</font>

318
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,329
page for any amount of time it's

319
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,380
probably going to be longer than one

320
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,829
second

321
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,960
after the page is finished loading so

322
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,910
for those are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways to do</font>

323
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,010
this and as it turns out in true

324
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,689
positive rate can be very high as in

325
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,750
there's very little damage to chew

326
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,250
possible for doing the splitting policy

327
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,010
so that's mostly solved and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

328
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,150
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to paper and so now we're</font>

329
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to deal with the zero gap</font>

330
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,980
issue so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do here</font>

331
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,350
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zurka</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't</font>

332
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,410
just split based on a time gap we have

333
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,000
to try to split where there is no time

334
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,560
get along and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds very difficult</font>

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,840
but there are features that we can use

336
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can leverage here for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

337
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,500
one feature is there's a sudden decrease

338
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,110
in packet rate at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> start of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet</font>

339
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,340
sequence another future you can use here

340
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,900
is that there's a large number of

341
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,780
outgoing packets at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> start of packet</font>

342
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,250
sequence so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm based on this we can</font>

343
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,750
really distinguish between the start of

344
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,400
a packet sequence and the middle or end

345
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,900
of a packet sequence and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

346
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do splitting that's essentially</font>

347
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,970
another version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splitting problem</font>

348
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,740
so there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really two problems</font>

349
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,450
here we have some collected data we do

350
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">then splitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on large time gaps we</font>

351
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,510
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> packaged sequences we try to</font>

352
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,010
split in some more because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the large</font>

353
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,020
time Kevin isn't going to do is zero

354
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,910
time gap so there are actually two

355
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,040
classification problems here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

356
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero gap and if so find a split those</font>

357
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,620
are both kind of difficult for the first

358
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:25,080
one we can answer it fairly accurately

359
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,610
the ideal case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this table is if we</font>

360
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">give the true answer is we should split</font>

361
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,480
then we have one there for which we

362
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,220
guess that we should split and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also</font>

363
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,140
we have one across diagram that would be

364
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,420
ideal and we are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to ideal in</font>

365
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,400
answering the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a split</font>

366
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,500
in this packet sequence in despair

367
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:46,470
package sequences even when there's no

368
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">time gap but oops but in finding the gap</font>

369
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,130
that becomes much more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

370
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,620
positive case we can still find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gap</font>

371
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,240
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zero case the accuracy becomes a</font>

372
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,920
bit lower and for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative case that's</font>

373
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,990
why we don't really have a solution here

374
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,569
the accuracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is much much lower so we</font>

375
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,040
can maybe find a gap better than just

376
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,330
randomly guessing but the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

377
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,800
going to be poor and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

378
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,750
significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect the classification</font>

379
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,400
accuracy but the other two parts we can

380
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,560
solve with much higher accuracy and

381
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,670
there's a there's a classifier behind

382
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,469
this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go into detail</font>

383
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,990
that's also in the paper so that's part

384
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">two now we go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to part straight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

385
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,860
final part maintaining a training set

386
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,689
now maintaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> your training set is a</font>

387
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,640
bit of a trade-off issue because the

388
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,470
returns that gets very<font color="#E5E5E5"> old then it's not</font>

389
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,910
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effective anymore so</font>

390
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,620
there's really three problems that we

391
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,910
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer here first of all how</font>

392
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">much time does it take to collect the</font>

393
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,750
training set second of all how large

394
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,670
should an effective training set B as in

395
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,080
a larger training set would of course

396
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,990
have more data for the classifier to

397
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,790
leverage and sort of all how does age

398
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,260
affect the affected effectiveness of a

399
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">training set so it's a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

400
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:49,260
balancing problem here and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

401
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,610
related in a multiplicative sense the

402
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,260
answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> those questions is for the</font>

403
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,120
first one it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes about 15 seconds to</font>

404
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,800
load a single packet sequence for a

405
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,420
second one a large effective training

406
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,010
set for our problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a few</font>

407
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,300
thousand package sequences and we're

408
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,319
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how age affects the</font>

409
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,540
effectiveness we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a we really</font>

410
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,040
have a bit of a trade-off issue here we

411
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,140
have we can either do a small

412
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,529
uninformative and fresh training set or

413
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,330
we can do a large informative but data

414
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,640
training set and both of those either

415
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,080
one of those may have higher accuracy

416
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,360
but of course you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to find a sweet</font>

417
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,180
spot which kind of maybe has the best of

418
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">both worlds and so if we don't manage to</font>

419
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a sweet spot of course our accuracy</font>

420
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,980
degrades significantly so here there's

421
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,680
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphs for this here is one of</font>

422
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">those graphs showing the accuracy the</font>

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,160

424
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,560
the x-axis is the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the training</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this is the age of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data set</font>

431
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">in anti</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the y-axis is the accuracy about</font>

432
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,000
10 days old<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see that the</font>

433
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:07,410
accuracy drops some was steadily when it

434
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,760
gets about 10 days old<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah but if</font>

435
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,199
it's only one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> days old which is</font>

436
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">entirely possible if we have several</font>

437
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,190
thousand elements in our data set and we

438
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,319
just keep updating its regularly we can

439
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,970
still maintain its original high

440
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,620
accuracy value so and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

441
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,410
doesn't drop that drastically just

442
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,300
across 10 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> old and so what we've</font>

443
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,430
really said here is we can deal with

444
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,229
this training set maintenance issue just

445
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,880
by finding a clever balance between the

446
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,920
size of the training set and the age of

447
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> training set</font>

448
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,240
so what's the main takeaway of this talk

449
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,280
we've looked at all those issues with

450
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,630
realistic website fingerprinting and we

451
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,030
have proposed new algorithms new

452
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">classifiers new solutions new ways to</font>

453
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,709
look at those to tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to resolve</font>

454
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,290
those issues so what the main takeaway

455
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,000
here is we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really add even though</font>

456
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,890
there are issues we can deal with those

457
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,080
issues which is to say website<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

458
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrinting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be realistic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be made</font>

459
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,390
more realistic realistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

460
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,010
be made more realistic and maybe it's

461
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,260
time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for our</font>

462
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,330
website fingerprinting defense to defeat

463
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,530
those attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it for all so that's</font>

464
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,590
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my top and thank you for</font>

465
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,589
listening
