1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,838
great thanks Nick I should acknowledge

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,000
my co-authors in particular this was the

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,300
PhD work of Henry tan at Georgetown who

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,839
I mistakenly let graduate and so he's

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular this paper is really about</font>

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,350
traffic correlation attacks and there

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,670
are different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of traffic</font>

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,439
correlation attacks but the type of

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,410
traffic correlation attack that that I

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,020
care about in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk is an adversary</font>

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,210
who can see traffic entering this black

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,309
box because tours perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor network</font>

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,610
and look at the traffic coming out and

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,218
then use things like packet counting and

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,980
see me timing analysis to match inputs

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,170
and outputs so if the adversary is able

19

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both the ingress I of traffic</font>

23
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,919
pretty good idea of who's talking to

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,610

<font color="#CCCCCC">who are using tor the entire paper is</font>

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,130
kind of there's a symmetric argument for

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,229
the egress which we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font>

33
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:32,039
traffic correlation has been examined a

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:35,929
lot before there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really great</font>

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,710
papers on this that show how to do this

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,500
stephen has a good one that shows how to

37
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,548
do this really efficiently most of the

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,860
prior work in this area assumes a static

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,140
guilty of this where they take tour as

it is and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some point in time freeze a</font>

map and then look at do some analysis

46
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,149
based on that frozen map and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

these traffic analysis correlation

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,579
attacks you need to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

52
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,799
that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of a esas</font>

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,310
reverse path need not and often are not

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,440
symmetric this leaves an adversary is

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,830
not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that path in a very unfortunate</font>

wants to enumerate for the client is but

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,810
it's not on the ingress path this entire

66

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,340

that operate only at the data plane we

76
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,060
assume that tour wants to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,250
this technique and isn't going to

anonymize as much of tours as possible

88
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,620
so what it's going to do is target the

108

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
aren't propagated so you can't do an

116
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,729
attack against a specific IP address you

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,320
can't do it / 32 for example and that's

118
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,900
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had this collateral damage</font>

119
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:17,270
that we'll talk about later how does

120
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,549
routing logic work well so at border

121
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,590
routers the next hop is bait has to be

122
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:26,479
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the longest prefix match the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">most specific compatible path in case of</font>

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,820

125
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,679
decide how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is done typically this</font>

126
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,930
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by preferring customers over</font>

127
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,740
peers over providers because money is

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,570
good in the case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS tend to</font>

129

prefer shortest paths over<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer its</font>

130
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,840
paths last bit of background this idea

131
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,390
of longest prefix height prefix routing

132
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,239
allows for a longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix hijacking</font>

133
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:56,840
attack which is basically I announce if

134
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a / 23 and I take their IP</font>

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,880
address and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce a / 24 because</font>

136
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,700
I'm more specific everybody is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:10,340
come to me and this has happened in the

138
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,050
past with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube tour is as others</font>

139
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,119
have noted is vulnerable to longest

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,830
prefix hijacking attack and again the

141
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,380
adversaries goal is to be on the ingress

142
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,820
path so what the adversary did does is

143
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,370
to sort the guard relays by their

144
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,740
selection probability this information

145
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,660
is public and then for each relay whose

146
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,360

147
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:37,460
that's shorter than a / 24 it attacks

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,900
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the overall so</font>

149
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,580
the first thing we looked at is the

150
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,948
overall vulnerability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour guards</font>

152
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:49,250
interesting axes here is a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> y axis</font>

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,770
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advertised bandwidth as a</font>

154
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,360
fraction of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tour bandwidth and we find</font>

155
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,049
that actually we were very surprised by

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,520
this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-two percent of toward</font>

157
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,860
guard bandwidth belongs two routers

158
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,930
whose IP addresses are covered in

159
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,340
prefixes shorter than / 24 in other

160
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,800
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-two percent of guard</font>

161
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,378
bandwidth is vulnerable now that said

162
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,780
there's several important caveat so this

163
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,969
one you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to launch</font>

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">4,000 bgp attacks that would definitely</font>

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,110

168
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,849
easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do man in the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which are</font>

170
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,628
continue that on to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guard so</font>

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,550
the guard traffic is actually used which

172
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:34,520
is what our adversary is trying to do is

173
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,440
is harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in it the adversaries</font>

174
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,090
ability to do that depends on its actual

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,979
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> location so one thing that we</font>

and some other different sources to show

that this generally is an accurate<font color="#CCCCCC"> map</font>

185
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,479
and then what we did is we considered

186
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,930
adversaries who were willing to launch a

187
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,539

202
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,010
about thirteen percent we also looked at

<font color="#CCCCCC">plenty of details in the paper what we</font>

circumstance what happened stamps to be

217
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:33,200
on the ingress path but by launching the

218
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,440
attack you get this curve which shows

219
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,720
you know you're able to get not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

222
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:50,090
we broke this down by type of autonomous

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:53,120
system so the second half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our paper</font>

224
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,860
is to look at defenses what can't or I

do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if it cares to do anything</font>

about it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level approach is</font>

227
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,240
as follows so what guards are going to

228
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,099
do or they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use traceroute</font>

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,660
sand tray syrups I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> are vulnerable</font>

230
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,920
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this vulnerable or</font>

231
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,110
I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this vulnerability in a</font>

232
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,060
bit but they perform tracer outs to

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:18,080
discover their<font color="#CCCCCC"> one hop a.s neighborhood</font>

234
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,670
and they attest to that neighborhood by

235
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,530
including it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor descriptors which</font>

238
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,920
will so that clients can authenticate

239
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:33,380
that information we're introducing these

240
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,229
quasi trusted CPA nodes these are kind

241
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of special</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tour clients which assess the</font>

243
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,310
these assessments are going to be

244
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,569
published into our directories and based

245
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,180
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their assessments we're going to</font>

246
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,070
assign guards to either have a safe safe

247
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,380
guard flag which case clients will

248
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,360
decide to use them or not not have the

249
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:58,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">safe guard flag in which case clients</font>

250
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,320
should avoid their use ok so these CPAs

251
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,260
their job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to assess the quality of</font>

252
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,680
the ass level path to a guard we use

253
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,370
three techniques the sub path property

254
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,040
was

255
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,050
elsewhere we're borrowing from that we

256
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">found that it is insufficient and</font>

257
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,479
vulnerable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manipulation so the to the</font>

258
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">pop count and the relay relay neighbor</font>

259
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">AS discovery protocols are ones that</font>

260
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:26,240
we've used to boost the security of the

261
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:30,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">subpath property what is the sub half</font>

262
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:35,480
property it says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's an AAS</font>

263
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:39,110

<font color="#CCCCCC">X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 to xn then the past from a to X I is</font>

265
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,450
x 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> x 2 up to X i minus 1 we did some</font>

266
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,510
measurements on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to confirm</font>

267
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,250
that this generally does hold hold true

268
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,710
so the sub path property<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

269
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,720
about BGP works this makes sense that it

270
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:58,100
that you would do this most of the time

271
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,710
so how does this OP have property work

272
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:07,190
as a defense against routing the BGP

273
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:10,640
manipulation so suppose that can you

274
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,770
read any of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh this note is</font>

275
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,660
this a s is malicious and the default

276
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,579
path goes this way because it's

277
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,730
malicious it launches an attack that if

278
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,850
that causes<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to this guard to go</font>

279
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,070
down the southern road if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a</font>

280
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,080
traceroute if the sepia does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer</font>

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">out to the guard it's going to get back</font>

282
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:34,220
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> path here but then if it does a</font>

283
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,640
sub a trace route to the penultimate the

284
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,740
AAS before the guard it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

285
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,080
this path which is not a sub pass now

286
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,350
why does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen it gets this path</font>

287
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,320
the northern path because the adversary

288
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,940
is just attacking this prefix that

289
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">belongs to the the guard right the BGP</font>

290
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,959
attacks are specific and only affect the

291
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,890
announced cider or in this case this

292
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:06,529
block of IP addresses so by taking parts

293
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,569
of the sub path or of the returned as

294
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:12,500
path and doing trace rights to those you

295
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,120
can discover discrepancies this is works

296
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,510
fine as long as the adversary doesn't

297
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,640
know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this traceroute can be</font>

298
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,689

299
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,370
no security

300
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,260
in the face of an informed attacker so

301
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,630
the goals of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our new defenses are to</font>

make this type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust traceroute</font>

303
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:37,880
manipulation much more difficult in the

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">subpath property check more robust one</font>

305
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,150
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guard can do as I</font>

306
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,700
mentioned before is it can discover

307
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:47,390
there ASAP hoods and post them to tour

308
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,990
directories and this limits the lies

309
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:54,170
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> adversary you can tell about</font>

guard relays it in other words in other

312
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,810
words it requires the adversary to also

313
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,200
be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path to the guards neighbors</font>

314
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,699
and in our attack model the adversary

315
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:14,300
isn't able to physically move it can

316

only launch virtual attacks using<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP as</font>

observation that we made through some

322
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,760
empirical measurements is that the hop

323
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:35,030

324
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same as from Bob to Alice and we can</font>

325
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:41,120
use this heuristic to again discover

326
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:47,090

327

can kind of target a guard that you like

and cause it not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used we have some</font>
