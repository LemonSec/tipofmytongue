1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,500
good afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone my name is</font>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,230
machine so today I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present</font>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">this work a qualitative study done with</font>

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,700
my advisor professor Jung Hwan and which

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">one doing so we're trying to understand</font>

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,520
people to perception of of Jones this

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,320
emerging emerging technology so the

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,990
motivation of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> study comes from two</font>

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,830
aspects so first there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a few</font>

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,630
studies about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jones by by scholars from</font>

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,389
different fields such as government

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,549
agencies legal scholars about Jones

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,879
safety and security<font color="#E5E5E5"> but little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is known</font>

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:42,599
how how people think about about Jones

15
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:45,839
second is people's perception of Jones

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,820
can help us to inform future privacy

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,129
enhancing<font color="#E5E5E5"> junk design as well as public</font>

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">parallel policies so in this particular</font>

19
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,780
study we understand people's perception

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,940
of Jones from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bystanders perspective</font>

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,989
so by saying bystanders we mean people

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,300
who do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have experience with drugs so</font>

23
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,530
we adopt<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interview interview</font>

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,850
methodology in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> study so we have for</font>

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,619
the interview protocol we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,658
type of questions the first type is

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,270
general questions so in the general

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,189
questions we basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask people some</font>

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,439
general aspects of Jones for example

30
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,360
have you ever see Jones flight do you

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,600
see any benefits and issues of Jones

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,369
this kind of questions the second type

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">of question our context based questions</font>

34
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,530
so because as a professor Helen

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,900
nissenbaum mentioned that human behavior

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,380
are always situated in some concrete

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,000
context so we provide five scenarios in

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,280
order to get people's perception on the

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,710
different context so our scenarios

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,259
include recording of promotional<font color="#CCCCCC"> events</font>

41
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,110
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shopping mall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by our stall owner</font>

42
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,079
on delivering goods by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon recording</font>

43
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,240
a friend's party are reporting a parade

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,520
by the news agency<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also search for</font>

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,729
criminals in your neighborhood by the

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,408
local<font color="#E5E5E5"> police department so and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also the</font>

47
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,039
third type of questions are about

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,710
specific aspects of Jones for example we

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participants to compare the</font>

50
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,329
differences between jones and other

51
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,680
tracking technologies such as phones and

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,939
CCTVs

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,769
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joan we use for the study in</font>

54
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,140
terms of participant that we have 16

55
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,840
interviews in total and the fifty

56
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,309
percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them mail filter female then</font>

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,430
their age ranges from 60 18 to 62 years

58
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,459
old with an average<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 29 and our</font>

59
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,629
participants also represented a variety

60
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of ethnic backgrounds advisor as well as</font>

61
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:45,629
occupations so for data analysis we

62
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,269
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> all recorded all the interviews</font>

63
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,518
upon the participants<font color="#CCCCCC"> information we</font>

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,889
then translate the other interviews all

65
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interviews into pling tags we</font>

66
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:58,680
conducted a thematic analysis which is a

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,019
commonly<font color="#CCCCCC"> used method for qualitative</font>

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,450
data analysis so how we do this as

69
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,129
follow so we first immerse immersed

70
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,619
ourselves in the data by carefully

71
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,899
reading all the other interviewee other

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,030
interview transcripts and then take

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,799
notes for those meaningful meaningful

74
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,879
patterns now so we are then we

75
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,370
independently code the the transcript

76
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:26,069
transcripts and then then we discussed

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,750
our difference and the win discuss how

78
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:34,078
we can group<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs into high level</font>

79
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,989
things and then we come up with nine

80
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:39,150
themes 132 unique codes and nine themes

81
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,909
here are the things we come up with and

82
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,250
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last step is is we revisit</font>

83
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:48,599
everything and to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the</font>

84
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,919
interview excerpt each team coherently

85
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:58,259
represent a day under the underlying<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

86
00:03:51,919 --> 00:04:03,629
magazine so so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us to</font>

87
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:05,849
the finding so so because the time Tom

88
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">strains i'm not going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about all</font>

89
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,709
the funnies here are some the most

90
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,930
interesting ones so first public space

91
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,579
or private space is a key<font color="#CCCCCC"> factor that</font>

92
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,049
our participant in considered in

93
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,840
determining their expectations of

94
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,840
privacy and also whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joan is</font>

95
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joan violence there there</font>

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,299
privacy so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking if a Joan</font>

97
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,940
take a photo or<font color="#E5E5E5"> record a video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or even</font>

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">just flies in the private area and they</font>

99
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,800
consider that the Joan invades their

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,020
privacy so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of intuitive but</font>

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,840
this brought out a very interesting

102
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">question so what is private space what</font>

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,500
is public space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where is the</font>

104
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,780
boundary between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Providence public space</font>

105
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,919
so our participant actually brought up

106
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,780
very there is understanding of poverty

107
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,349
space in public space here's an example

108
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:59,859
so as this participant suggested so

109
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:02,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">he/she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> considered even she's in the</font>

110
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,800
public space as long as she's not

111
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,389
participating in any public event she

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,940
still considered that as the practice

113
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,800
space for example she specifically

114
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,889
mentioned that if I'm sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in</font>

115
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,710
the in a shopping mall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I considered the</font>

116
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:21,490
area around me as private space because

117
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,130
if you walk close to me you will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

118
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear my phone call or look at my</font>

119
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:31,450
email if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you want to so so in</font>

120
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this case so she has a very</font>

121
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">different understanding of public space</font>

122
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:40,299
then so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time constraint</font>

123
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,239
then I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to show all these</font>

124
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,580
samples so that detailed we have various

125
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,440
definitions from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> participants about</font>

126
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">private space and public space you can</font>

127
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">find it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper another funny we</font>

128
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,919
have is about people's is based on the

129
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,710
scenario questions or participant is

130
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,599
suggested<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have different</font>

131
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,138
expectations of privacy under different

132
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:07,830
scenarios especially on our participant

133
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggests that they're expecting expected</font>

134
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,469
notification and consent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> German</font>

135
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:18,369
usage in different context for example

136
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,910
in in the recording parade scenario this

137
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:26,110
participants to suggest that prior

138
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:28,180
notification is is needed however in the

139
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,710
attending a party attending party and

140
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,680
record the party scenario this

141
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,700
participant also she suggested that

142
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,920
prior notification is not the

143
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,039
sir because if you are not consent to

144
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,250
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be recorded</font>

145
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,440
that you should not go to the party then

146
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,110
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting findings we have</font>

147
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,480
from our study is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that comparison</font>

148
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:57,080
between jones and other technologies

149
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:59,030
like camera phones and CCTVs so as just

150
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,010
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our participants there are four</font>

151
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,770
factors that can differentiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jones</font>

152
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,750
with other checking technologies first

153
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,070
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the distance of recording the</font>

154
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,830
distance of recording indicates that

155
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,550
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> using Joan photos can be taken in a</font>

156
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,010
distance without the people's awareness

157
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,650
the flexibility indicates that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joan</font>

158
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,659
can can actively invade bystanders

159
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,909
personal space which we can their

160
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,040
control over<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own privacy and the</font>

161
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:30,470
visibility and or accessibility of the

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">controller means that when the Joan even</font>

163
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,270
a Joan is spotted and it's flying on in

164
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,570
the sky the people the the controller

165
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,190
can still hide from the public side and

166
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bystanders is not able to know</font>

167
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,160
who is the controller and we call this

168
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hidden controller also the intended</font>

169
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,420
purpose means that the intended purpose

170
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,750
of the journalists are known to the

171
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,880
bystanders so here's the example as the

172
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,100
100 the participant is said when the gym

173
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,380
is when the phone is taking the photo

174
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:05,480
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> most likely see it and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

175
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:07,040
it is taking a poem but but with the

176
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,800
Jones they were you are not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

177
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,540
know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's even though you see</font>

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gym</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know who the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

179
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,860
behind this so Joe from this these

180
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,680
conclusions we we brought up this

181
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,020
concept of the duality of the Jones so

182
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,360
the duality of the Jones means that

183
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,760
people's perception of Jones are not

184
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,100
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounded to the to the joint itself</font>

185
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,720
but also the controller behind the job

186
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,599
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their and the people to the</font>

187
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,950
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drunk controllers</font>

188
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,099
so this week or what we call this the

189
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">duality of the job the idea is that as</font>

190
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,360
the this participant is suggested when

191
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,230
the dome is taking a photo you don't

192
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,780
even know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is the controller so</font>

193
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,650
on this these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all the finance lead</font>

194
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,689
us to the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our of our</font>

195
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,910
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> so first we as I mentioned</font>

196
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">before we want to highlight the duality</font>

197
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,510
of Jones<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we want to mention the</font>

198
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">dome stability to to invade people's</font>

199
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,189
physical privacy as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

200
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,229
information privacy so physical privacy

201
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,440
means people's privacy in their physical

202
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,670
space such as their office or houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

203
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information privacy means the</font>

204
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,800
people's personal data so their names

205
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're addressed and their credit card</font>

206
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,569
number things like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but so if you</font>

207
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,210
come but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of the duality of</font>

208
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:31,480
the Jones and the physical privacy and

209
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,550
information privacy together so you were

210
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,070
noticed that sean has the ability to

211
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,990
invade the full physical privacy and

212
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,270
information privacy but what's more

213
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,210
important is that in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case even</font>

214
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,699
John<font color="#E5E5E5"> even Joan invade people's physical</font>

215
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:50,740
privacy and information privacy most

216
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:54,160
people were not were most likely don't

217
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:58,510
know who is who is a controller behind

218
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,400
the job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so this is this is the</font>

219
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,370
time when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy concerns arise and</font>

220
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,079
also we discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's contest to</font>

221
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,840
base the privacy concerns so as I

222
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,060
mentioned before there are several

223
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,830
context factors such as whether the dome

224
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,770
is flying in Paris space or public space

225
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:18,430
or the purpose of the drone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also</font>

226
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:22,449
raise different<font color="#E5E5E5"> private concerns the</font>

227
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:28,449
privacy concerns of jobs so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

228
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">other findings like you know people's we</font>

229
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,590
our participants suggest that they have

230
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,810
a clear understanding of the benefits of

231
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,270
Jones and the future development and

232
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,420
future the future of her Jones and also

233
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">they also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up the security</font>

234
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,469
concerns as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as safety concerns for</font>

235
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,089
example if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drone fall down from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,329
sky they will be hurt tastes like this

237
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,999
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

238
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,269
cover this here so again if you if

239
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:56,089
interest you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it in a paper so</font>

240
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:58,579
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next part we want to draw is the</font>

241
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:02,059
design implication and also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

242
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:05,599
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a policy implication</font>

243
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:07,399
so first we placed our findings we

244
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,649
proposed to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level design</font>

245
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:14,779
principles so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I is making</font>

246
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:17,089
so future we propose that future Joan

247
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:19,189
should and their controllers should make

248
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">him both the Joan and their controller</font>

249
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,420
more discoverable approachable and

250
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,309
accountable to the bystanders so that

251
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,160
they can be discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can know</font>

252
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:31,040
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and also we suggest that the</font>

253
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,480
future drone system can should enable

254
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,748
the communication between<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown</font>

255
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,879
controllers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other nurse citizens or</font>

256
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:40,850
or as we call by sanders and also a

257
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:43,220
future drone should future manufacturer

258
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,759
should make<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joan design sensitive to</font>

259
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,249
local to local social and cultural norms

260
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,290
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest also suggested by a</font>

261
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:53,739
you know the content contextual

262
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,779
integrity so that because you know

263
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:58,699
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have different</font>

264
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:02,540
expectations under different social and

265
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:07,099
cultural context to be more specific we

266
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:09,199
have some we made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some specific design</font>

267
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,980
suggestions from two dimensions so the

268
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:15,049
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> dimension is from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Joan control and</font>

269
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">its controllers versus bystanders and</font>

270
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:22,279
also proactive measures versus reactive

271
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:25,040
matters so for example Joan can actively

272
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:28,009
send out signals indicating that it's so

273
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,679
here the first the first ones then

274
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:33,439
figures in fig<font color="#CCCCCC"> nose signals so that</font>

275
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,660
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

276
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:39,230
photo will know it is taking photos and

277
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,910
then they can probably walk away thus we

278
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,239
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that future systems should</font>

279
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,309
support this type of signal

280
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:51,019
communication also another example would

281
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:53,089
be bystanders can actively you know send

282
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,610
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access the photos which</font>

283
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,759
might have done in the site so future we

284
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,740
suggest that future<font color="#E5E5E5"> system should also</font>

285
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,140
provide this kind of

286
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,330
communication the possibility of the

287
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication between the bystanders and</font>

288
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:11,650
and controllers we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

289
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,780
detailed policy implications and then

290
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,000
because of time limit I'm not present

291
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:19,089
here so we're presenting this work in a

292
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,950
FT C drum workshop in this fall in

293
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,110
Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC so hopefully we can</font>

294
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,530
provide them some people input on the

295
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:29,320
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> policymakers so a little bit</font>

296
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,360
about ongoing future work so we are

297
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,730
because this study is from the

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,630

299
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:40,120
understand the perp the perception from

300
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,200
the controller perspective to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

301
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,720
whether there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any differences</font>

302
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,070
between their understanding and also we

303
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,120
want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some practical</font>

304
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,340
mechanisms that can that that is

305
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,390
acceptable by post controllers and

306
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:58,630
bystanders so the major takeaway from

307
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,270
this from our study so the first is we

308
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,189
provide empirical evidence for the

309
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,860
safety security security and privacy

310
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,100
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Jones and also again we won't</font>

311
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,450
highlight the duality of John and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

312
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,310
third is we are proposed that the

313
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:18,370
proactive and reactive suggestions for

314
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:22,959
future own future privacy handsome drone

315
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,800
design um thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the any questions</font>

316
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,800
I'll be happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take them</font>
