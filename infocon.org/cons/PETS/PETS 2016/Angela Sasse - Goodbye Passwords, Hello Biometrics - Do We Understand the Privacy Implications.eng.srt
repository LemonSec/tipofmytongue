00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
Oh goodbye password para biometrics do

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,000
we understand the privacy implications

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,910
I'll spare you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tension of getting to</font>

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,800
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk and tell you the</font>

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:23,070
answer is I think know and well I'll

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,199
explain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then</font>

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,150
some thoughts about you know if we don't

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,510
understand once we do understand the

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,000
privacy implications what might we how

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,700
should we respond to this so for those

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,290
of you who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know me very well I</font>

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:44,789
started my work as George said now 20

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago looking at password behavior</font>

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,200
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in organizations of employees</font>

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations which were causing the</font>

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,379
organization's considerable cost and

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,269
considerable headaches because they just

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,390
basically couldn't remember their their

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,090
their passwords and the cost of running

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,189
the help desks was out of control and

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the accountants were beating</font>

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,929
up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security people saying you've got</font>

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,090
to stop this this can't go on we can't

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,720
employ a hundred people who do<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,759
all day long but reset passwords for our

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">employees were just literally what they</font>

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,030
they have at the time right so and I was

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically so I got into you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beware</font>

29
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes you know these sentences that</font>

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,810
that totally change your career in my

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">case it was could you do a quick study</font>

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,390
and tell us why these stupid users can't

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,000
remember their passwords that was

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,759
basically what got me into into doing

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,920
this study and the answer was well you

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
know who's stupid here you're asking

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,570
people to do something that's humanly

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,030
impossible I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> at less well</font>

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">understood part of when we published</font>

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,899
this in 1999 this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper uses some of the</font>

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,189
enemy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> atoms and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I the part of you</font>

42
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,899
know it's it's I think it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

43
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,210
frequently cited paper and usable

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,950
security but I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

45
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,399
like most people haven't read the second

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,530
half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay okay where we actually</font>

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,930
then explained what happened as a result

48
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,870
is what what are the consequences before

49
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,090
consequences when the employees

50
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,650
experiences they're being told to do

51
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,810
something in the name of security that

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">their find impossible to do is there</font>

53
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,269
their whole perception of security

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,379
becomes that it's a joke basically right

55
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:34,469
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just becomes a team sport to find</font>

56
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,298
workarounds around the security in order

57
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,760
to keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> show on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> road</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

58
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,980
delivering you know you put your service

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,620
and your productivity and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,018
is I mean to some extent looking back at

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,470
it I'm actually shocked I'm shocked it

62
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:55,319
took 20 years for this recognition about

63
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:58,040
what the damage is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

64
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:04,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">the damage is as a result of not</font>

65
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,840
considering what is the the impact on on

66
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,930
productivity and what is the impact on

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mindset of you know the 99 percent</font>

68
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,549
of people who are not security experts

69
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,680
and will find they can't follow these

70
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,780
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been mandated I think</font>

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,599
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> only after the the NIST</font>

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,280
study you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> which basically where we</font>

73
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">were we Illustrated this you know the</font>

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">great authentication fatigue and and</font>

75
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,089
said like you know really you could

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,010
argue to some extent nothing has changed

77
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,650
since since users are not the enemy

78
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">right people are still feeling they have</font>

79
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,909
to authenticate far too much they're

80
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,189
failing at it quite often and once you

81
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:43,198
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the impact on</font>

82
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,970
productivity and that's not just the

83
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,709
time they're actually spending on those

84
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:55,159
those authentication tasks but it's the

85
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:57,720
disruption that authentication causes so

86
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,728
when you when you're basically

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,319
interrupted in the middle of a task and

88
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,090
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> like will prove to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

89
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,280
you know authenticate give me a password

90
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,689
you know just like this it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,209
the time you spend on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

92
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,470
authentication task you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

93
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,720
when when you've finished your

94
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,389
authentication task you can't seamlessly

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,220
resume where you left off with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

96
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,349
primary task like you basically going

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where was i before I started this</font>

98
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,279
and the the pretty short of like

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,930
stunning inside and I was shocked with

100
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,130
myself that it's taken me as a human

101
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,560
factors person it took me

102
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,469
this long to actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express</font>

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,780
this and quantify this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you re</font>

104
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing you have to redo about forty</font>

105
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,619
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work you've already</font>

106
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:43,110
expended on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary task and then</font>

107
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know before you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even back to to</font>

108
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,840
where you were when you were interrupted

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,750
so this this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you know ZD</font>

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,450
once you start adding is up the impact

111
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">on productivity is truly you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

112
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gigantic and you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> observe</font>

113
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,140
anywhere in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nest study we published</font>

114
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,060
it with a small sample of users but I've

115
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,789
done work in organizations where we've

116
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,860
looked at hundreds or thousands of users

117
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,200
the impact on productivity is truly

118
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,210
stunning and people react to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

119
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,250
know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't take this passively but</font>

120
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,960
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can observe now is that people</font>

121
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:22,950
we organize their workflow to avoid

122
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:25,229
authentication yeah so and from of

123
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,940
course if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a well you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

124
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,190
designed business process<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

125
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,260
well-designed workflow your operations

126
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,330
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when they find this out</font>

127
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,280
they start you know jumping up and down

128
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">it running and screaming and saying like</font>

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,719
ah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this isn't you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my whole</font>

130
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,030
business process isn't working as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,790
thought just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because people start to</font>

132
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,739
batch tasks so they can minimize the

133
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,840
number of authentications they have to

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,690
do right and this is truly basically

135
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,539
putting the you know the cart before the

136
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,980
horse and you can see in in the

137
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,450
corporate world what with them what

138
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,610
we've documented there is people

139
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,210
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> opt out of services their</font>

140
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,130
return devices you know so we describe

141
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,989
these examples in the study that they're

142
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,170
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> their laptop back and saying keep</font>

143
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,990
it i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it anymore and then the</font>

144
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT department says oh but then you</font>

145
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,070
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> access your emails whilst your</font>

146
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,729
away and the response is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's</font>

147
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,730
tough so everybody has to wait two or

00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,860
now add on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effect of that basically</font>

150
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,380
happening so you're holding up lots of

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people and it's it's actually</font>

152
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,320
really true gigantic I mean our

153
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,669
estimations at the moment we're still

154
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,040
working on trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quantify</font>

155
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,609
this in a solid way is that we're

156
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,500
probably you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

157
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,879
looking at a wastage of about thirty

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,889
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of proactivity you too badly</font>

159
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,460
designed authentication in some

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:53,319
organizations so some people of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

161
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,229
you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

162
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,710
pursue innovations in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name because</font>

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:01,810
they go well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

164
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,638
have with the security department in

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:08,500
order to to basically try this new thing

166
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,360
would be so much so that's one response

167
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,159
another response that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

168
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,199
software developers typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

169
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,879
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is just they engage in a</font>

massive collusion and hiding

organization they try to keep their

172
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,289
there are ways ideas away or what they

173
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,389
do away from security and you know

174
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,759
because if we if<font color="#E5E5E5"> security finds out</font>

175
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,469
they're going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us not to do it</font>

176
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so people and some people just leave</font>

177
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:33,370
and trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know another</font>

178
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,620
organizations where the productivity

179
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,750
isn't so much undermined and the iron is

180
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,669
of course is do you get for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

181
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,150
sacrifice and productivity do you get

182
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:45,128
better security and the answer is no

183
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,349
because the the policies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

184
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,740
security only<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists on paper when they</font>

to work around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security rules so</font>

187
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:58,089
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually behave as they</font>

00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:03,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't necessarily completely disregard</font>

189
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:05,409
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> visa concept you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that then</font>

190
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,210
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're to have total</font>

191

disregard for security but they engage

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,680
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call shadows security so they</font>

fight their try and find a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

managing the bestest the best they know

without but but you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way</font>

196
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,580
that they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is manageable and doable</font>

197
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,289
in the context of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think also</font>

198
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,240
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock-on effect that's very</font>

199
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:31,029
often in<font color="#CCCCCC"> non in organizations is when</font>

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,159
you get widespread non-compliance you're

201
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:37,120
creating a noise level on all your

202
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:39,760
monitoring capabilities and attackers

203
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,599
love this right if you have lots of

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,089
honest engaged users breaking the

205
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,459
security policy they're creating a noise

206
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,590
level on your monitoring function that

207
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,140
for the attackers is just an absolute

208
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,490
you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically snorkel in</font>

209
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,770
this you know to their heart's content

210
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:01,270
and do sorts of things without you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

211
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:03,850
triggering<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricking any responses so and</font>

212
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,560
and really I look back<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it and I'm</font>

213
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,480
still stunned and I go like why did we

214
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,979
allow this to go on for so long<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

215
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,870
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction of</font>

216
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,940
touchscreens has made the whole thing

217
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,610
was you know and we passed three years

218
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,770
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where the majority of</font>

219
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,040
passwords were not entered on keyboard

220
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:24,430
but on touchscreens and with

221
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,040
touchscreens the entry of a complexity

222
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight or longer password increases by a</font>

223
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,219
factor of three the error rate goes up

224
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:36,670
by a factor of three so you know and yet

225
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,280
basically week in the name of security

226
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,620
we kept killing it on to this like you

227
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,199
know oh no you must basically you must

228
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,270
basically do this but without again

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,220
without colluding in a malicious way of

230
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,199
course what we now find is that the

231
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,060
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of password the diversity of</font>

232
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,300
password files<font color="#CCCCCC"> and many service</font>

233
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,510
providers as as declined mercifully

234
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,160
right because users somehow with a

235
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of experience they'll figure</font>

236
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,770
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a small number of</font>

237
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:09,220
passwords that comply with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

238
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:12,819
but only require one toggle between the

239
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,880
two soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> key words right so again give</font>

240
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,250
to the attackers who in my experience

241
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,730
have pay a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

242
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,530
factors and psychology and then the then

243
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,780
the defenders do and that's not a bad

244
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,150
thing so I mean for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this we felt</font>

245
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,220
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty or say if we're</font>

246
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,750
generous and sakes it's a 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

247
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,030
1999 usable security research umpteen

248
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">alternative you know graphical</font>

249
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,680
authentication various kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

250
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,560
proposed and in the real world really

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,020
nothing changed as a result of it or

252
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,530
very certain something's changed so to

253
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,680
increase security we've had the rise of

254
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,510
two factor authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK's one of</font>

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,449
the other pioneers of this

256
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:04,910
it was deployed a pretty significant

257
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:07,040
cost to the banks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really they they</font>

258
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,030
pay so they spent 10 years standardizing

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,420
a protocol for using it actually very

260
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,610
few customers realize that they can use

261
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these tokens where you</font>

262
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,230
insert a card are actually you can use

263
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,450
the token from any bank and insert the

264
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,680
card from any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank into it most of</font>

265
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,480
them don't realize this and they

266
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,640
complain you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers are very</font>

267
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">unhappy they complain about the fact</font>

268
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,170
that they have to manage carry several

269
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,390
different tokens that the tokens work in

270
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,280
different ways that then the rules as to

271
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,660
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a token and you need to</font>

272
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">get is different and they're actually</font>

273
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:45,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">hated and so that's now led to 0</font>

274
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,880
basically a stampede where when people

275
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,800
ring up and say you know I can't use

276
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I've locked myself out or they say</font>

277
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,589
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another bank because I'm</font>

278
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,390
not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to be two-factor</font>

279
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,540
authentication anymore the answer is

280
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,160
have you tried our app on your

281
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,839
smartphone right do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

284
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the massive Stampede is that</font>

285
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,969
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going going that way so</font>

286
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,089
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> what do we have on the</font>

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:16,940
smartphone biometrics right we with the

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,820
were at is far last year basically they

293
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,500
were still going like I mean it's

294
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically there's two big things in</font>

295
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,750
biometrics right one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our da which is</font>

296
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,450
the indian national identity scheme with

297
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,990
1<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion users and the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

298
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,760
the iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically suddenly you</font>

299
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,170
have fingerprint recognition you have 6

300
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,300
million customers who are using

301
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,060
fingerprint recognition right this is

302
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,219
basically truly taken biometrics out of

303
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,859
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i was actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly sort of</font>

304
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,260
orchid subject and then it quite sort of

305
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed community you know doing doing</font>

306
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,780
sort of various kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things it's now</font>

307
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,760
really hit to consumer market and it's

308
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,819
now you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

309
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,649
floodgates have opened it's pretty much

310
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,110
not

311
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,119
touch recognition but suddenly voice

312
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,089
recognition companies who've been sort

313
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:18,339
of like scraping a living here and

314
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,740
really not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting anywhere for the past</font>

315
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:24,699
15 years and now basically making the

316
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:28,389
big sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are widely used last year</font>

317
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:31,449
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Siebert Jack Ma of Alibaba the</font>

318
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:33,639
biggest chinese website them came out

319
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:38,109
basically announced the smile to pay

320
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:44,139
which is face recognition on on the

321
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:46,720
phone and which is as easy he says as

322
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:49,749
taking a selfie yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a custom</font>

323
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,759
development by Alibaba own own software

324
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:53,679
team what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find really interesting</font>

325
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,439
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I'm waiting to actually</font>

326
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,279
really see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is that any of</font>

327
00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:01,990
you get a biometric readable passport

328
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,600
some of you must<font color="#CCCCCC"> write do you remember</font>

329
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:07,029
what what you were told you must not

330
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,119
what the specifications were when you

331
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:14,529
got the part with the photograph for it

332
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:16,089
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to procure it yourself what</font>

333
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:19,480
was what's the key one of the key

334
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:23,079
restrictions no smiling right and I'm

335
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,959
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ok right traditional face</font>

336
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,508
recognition actually have a problem with

337
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,888
smiling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we were sticky here so</font>

338
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,920
he's effectively telling us they've

339
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,569
cracked this but probably using the

340
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,160
surface features that are using deep

341
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:38,099
learning algorithm that means they're

342
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,629
not relying on the corners of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mouth</font>

343
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,779
as much as as face recognition

344
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:46,089
traditionally does very interesting as a

345
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,790
human factors usability person I'm still

346
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,319
going okay so you just made me pay far

347
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,079
too much for this thing that I

348
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:56,370
desperately need and now to top it I

349
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:59,649
have to smile when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I paying for it I</font>

350
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,980
think I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> not everybody will be</font>

351
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:04,959
happy with it now it's very clear that

352
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,389
if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know the face and it's</font>

353
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,638
very intuitively clear to people that

354
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:12,309
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very privacy-preserving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

355
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,529
so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing now is the hunt is</font>

356
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,329
on you know for like could we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

357
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:19,480
biometrics but they'd have more privacy

358
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:21,939
preserving and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yahoo basically alighted</font>

359
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,490
on this this this you know slightly what

360
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:24,670
you might

361
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,040
it's a slightly exotic little cousin

362
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:32,270
yeah which is ear recognition but in

363
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,949
fact the the the ear has has even been

364
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,819
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of national identity</font>

365
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,709
schemes you remember in most countries

366
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,540
when you have your photograph taken they

367
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:44,149
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you that the left ear must</font>

368
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,339
be visible on it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's been</font>

369
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:49,279
used as part of a distinguishing feature

370
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:52,930
and it was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned into a proper</font>

371
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:57,050
biometric as we know it by Swiss police

372
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:59,630
champion versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> right because in</font>

373
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,760
Switzerland there is it was with

374
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,070
successful burglaries say they found

375
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:12,830
there was a high incidence of ear prints

376
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:14,149
on window panes anybody know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm yes</font>

377
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,680
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if anyone's home and</font>

378
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Swiss burglars do this more than</font>

379
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,339
burglars in other parts of the country

380
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">or at least they used to because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

381
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:23,540
you're breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a Swiss home the</font>

382
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,339
likelihood that there is a there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,079
you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a male person</font>

384
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,959
inside the likelihood that they have a

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,089
rifle and know how to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's</font>

386
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:37,189
much higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> than almost than anywhere</font>

387
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:40,100
else except possibly in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

388
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,079
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so so that's it so it's a nice</font>

389
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,760
idea in a way it's like you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

390
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,979
showing my face all I need to do is

391
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,360
point the camera at my ear it slightly

392
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,040
tricky since you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really getting</font>

393
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,649
any visual feedback you need additional

394
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,230
auditory feedback to position correctly

395
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,410
but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the floodgates have</font>

396
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,880
opened um and I had to eat my words on

397
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,920
this one I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make fun of</font>

398
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,010
this proposed authentication scheme

399
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,530
that's using EEG where does it say oh

400
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,839
just think your password and we're

401
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,869
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> an EEG and that's basically then</font>

402
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,309
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate you and I was</font>

403
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically helpless up as you know</font>

404
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,000
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's impractical but</font>

405
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,569
actually guess what work in

406
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,540
human-computer interaction which

407
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:27,020
traditionally was trying to enable

408
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,720
direct input for disabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

409
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,510
know so that that but that has advanced

410
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,309
at such a rate that this is now becoming

411
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,539
a consumer technology it's actually a

412
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,309
story that that repeat

413
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,229
it's a fairly often you try and do

414
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,820
something to enable disable people's

415
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:44,210
functionality and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes a</font>

416
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,918
mainstream technology so it's said to be

417
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,690
like this the gaming community has

418
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,549
jumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this with with absolute</font>

419
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,859
alacrity because they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut</font>

420
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,929
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that it takes two to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

421
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,749
the input when you're gaming and so

422
00:17:53,929 --> 00:18:01,789
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I we now have a $300 consumer</font>

423
00:17:56,749 --> 00:18:04,970
device for direct input and so be

424
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,919
thinking your password so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you then</font>

425
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:12,559
have a combination of the

426
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:14,450
knowledge-based part and the EEG coming

427
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,200
in as the additional biometrics so

428
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:21,139
basically have one step<font color="#E5E5E5"> to factor an RGB</font>

429
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,979
0 effort authentication which is

430
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:26,689
intriguing so but but you're seeing

431
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,429
already here we're getting the shift so

432
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,649
so in a way the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news about</font>

433
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:33,109
fingerprints and face and so I'm being

434
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:35,449
used is pretty much last year's news but

435
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:38,389
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take and the rise of</font>

436
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:42,529
behavioral biometrics is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

437
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:48,799
what's what's this year's news one of

438
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:54,109
the the factors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stood in the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

439
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:56,210
adoption of traditional biometrics the

440
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,070
traditional static biometrics that take

441
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,440
a physical characteristic of the user

442
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,168
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been that that there are two types</font>

443
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,269
of failure rates the the failure to

444
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:10,070
enroll rate and then you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

445
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:12,139
either the failure to to the basically

446
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:17,899
tech typically the failure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize</font>

447
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:19,820
the person accurately and there's

448
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:22,158
there's a combination of different

449
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so typically what what happens is</font>

450
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,919
you get very high a very good failure to

451
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:30,679
enroll with a very low failure to enjoy

452
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,539
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like the face you get</font>

453
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,099
higher ones on fingerprints<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then</font>

454
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:38,090
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to deploy it the</font>

455
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:39,950
failure to to recognize a legitimate

456
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,199
user who's turning up with a token and

457
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,970
says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they are just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> digest</font>

458
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,450
too high so the ones that have a high

459
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,070
failure to enroll rate tend to perform

460
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,009
quite well for the in row

461
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,240
users and the ones that have a low

462
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:55,820
failure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enroll way tend to have very</font>

463
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,799
high false recognition rates out in the

464
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,689
field and and these kind of that has of

465
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:02,899
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of practical implications</font>

466
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:05,120
and that's really held you know has in a

467
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:07,129
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operational context many system</font>

468
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,320
owners have hesitated to deployed

469
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,509
because if they do operations research

470
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,700
and they understand productivity they

471
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:16,070
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means to even handle a one</font>

472
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,620
or two percent false rejection rate

473
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">never mind a five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or ten percent false</font>

474
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,969
rejection rate which a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

475
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:25,970
static biometrics have shown have shown

476
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the field so voila now we get</font>

behavior biometrics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter</font>

478
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">intuitively what it seems to turn out is</font>

479
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:37,759
is that they basically can get to

480
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,740
freakishly high accurate accuracy rates

481
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:46,039
which make deployment possible so Roy

482
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Maxion at CMU has basically spent spent</font>

483
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,450
a long time working on on typing

484
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
biometrics essentially the whole thing

485
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:56,480
started by him showing that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous</font>

486
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,850
only ninety five percent accurate was

487
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,340
down to some very elemental systems

488
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,539
engineering failure of the people who

489
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,039
did the measurements you know

490
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:06,379
essentially they didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

491
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:11,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">clocks tick different on different</font>

492
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:13,639
machines and once he basically sorted

493
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:16,370
that out he's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you know</font>

494
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:20,178
99 you know a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent is really</font>

495
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:23,059
not it's not it's achievable and it's

496
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:27,320
achievable with a relatively lower

497
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:29,330
number of enrollment rates so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

498
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that story seems to be repeating</font>

499
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,759
itself with various various other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

500
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,799
well or of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course with a lot of them</font>

501
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,049
we'd get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the sales brochure that</font>

502
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,559
this is the accuracy we're not getting

503
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:44,870
our hands on the data so what's happened

504
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,759
with a shift to biometrics is the banks

505
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,439
are still sort of smarting a little bit

506
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that expensive failure of</font>

507
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,299
introducing two-factor authentication

508
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:57,080
and they're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

509
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what biometrics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now you know</font>

510
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,350
do we really understand how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

511
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:03,928
works and you know when

512
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,330
maybe we should contract this out to

513
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,669
specialists and that really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the story</font>

514
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,428
that's that's that's happening now is is

515
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,799
that on a large scale banks are just

516
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,870
handing over authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

517
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">specialist companies that do this and</font>

518
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:21,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">then effectively just past yes no</font>

519
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,789
response back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bank so there's</font>

520
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,190
basically in various countries if you're

521
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:29,490
basically there's this company in in

522
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,559
Sweden so you're recognizing and then

523
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,570
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do it once you do this on</font>

524
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">a continuous basis that's what they're</font>

525
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:39,990
basically saying now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

526
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,850
a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of parameters and we we will</font>

527
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,970
basically confirm to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank that this</font>

528
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,199
is the legitimate customer and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

529
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,820
the banks are going like great you know

530
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,450
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some service level agreements</font>

531
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,370
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I'm just sort of a</font>

532
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit worried how few people are</font>

533
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:00,149
aware of the existence of companies like

534
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,340
bio catch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate services in</font>

535
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:06,870
certainly in North and South America for

536
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,418
all the market leading banks so they

537
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,520
basically using behavioral profiles

538
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,289
based on unique parameters assess a

539
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,668
cognitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> trait and eye coordination a</font>

540
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior competin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user's preferences</font>

541
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,580
some of this stuff is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like fairly</font>

542
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward you know like vacation</font>

543
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,780
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah we know about that but</font>

544
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:29,539
it's also these things like of how you

545
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,158
make the input on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> touchscreen</font>

546
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:34,140
already sort of thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a</font>

547
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
behavioral biometric but if they're not

548
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,730
sure it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you what they will do</font>

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,070
is yank the pointer off to a corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

550
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,360
the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you think oh this is you</font>

551
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,610
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know something's going</font>

552
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,370
wrong and then they recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> you by the</font>

553
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,990
way of how you drag it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back so you're</font>

554
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,570
basically you think effectively being

555
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,400
pushed to do some authentication when

556
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,379
they really have any problem and you

557
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,330
don't even realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's taking</font>

558
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,120
place right so you're being continuously

559
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,740
authenticated and having lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

560
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,959
people here in the audience I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate you</font>

561
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I don't need to spell out for you</font>

562
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,320
is is what kind of data sets we're

563
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:12,270
actually scumpa knees<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

564
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">their bio catches like that they've gone</font>

565
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">from they originally claimed to measure</font>

566
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">400 different</font>

567
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:20,590
mammatus recently they changed it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500</font>

568
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,570
different parameters on on their website

569
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,399
and as I said it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vast</font>

570
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,220
majority of the customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banks</font>

571
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,760
are completely unaware that this is

572
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,380
what's what's happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so I</font>

573
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,820
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're they're realizing</font>

574
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:41,110
this also we had a paper in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USA</font>

575
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,570
workshop on<font color="#CCCCCC"> monday by by miriam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> menezes</font>

prasad and my colleagues from newcastle

577
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,250
university which did a study on just

578
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,350
asking people about like you know do you

579
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,410
do you actually know about these these

580
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:57,459
sensors in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and and what they</font>

581
00:24:53,410 --> 00:25:00,340
do and the answer was that yes they know

582

<font color="#E5E5E5">touchscreen and some some very basic</font>

ones but they're not actually aware of

585
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,870
the hidden senses such as the

586

accelerometer and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you ask</font>

correctly worried that's green and if

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,950
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not worried that's red and what</font>

592
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like you know well they</font>

593
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,270
know about very few of the sensors and

594
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">they really don't understand what the</font>

potential implications for privacy are

596
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,430
and at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they are just</font>

597
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,450
really unconcerned about it and of

00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:40,000
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like we have this</font>

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,120
could potentially you know be used you

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's all the better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to track you</font>

602
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,669
track you with of course most of the

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:54,550
users derive some immediate benefit for

604
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:58,570
for them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's one of the things</font>

605
00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:01,570
that that we you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a lot</font>

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:04,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them aren't aware of is that the more</font>

607
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:08,980
widespread adoption becomes the less

608
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,930
opt-in really is an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when when</font>

609
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,570
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get widespread adoption of something</font>

610
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">then suddenly if you're not opting in</font>

611
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,010
and you're trying to stay out that

612
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,440
actually marks you how to see you know

613
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,260
as we the odd person out and so when

614
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,450
we're very typically here in in in focus

615
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,860
group and in conversations well yes you

616
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i don't like this and i wouldn't</font>

use one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you gotta you know no</font>

619
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,090
they're actually under not understanding

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in itself is not you know that</font>

they're being a refusenik in in the

weight society is going is not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

623
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,900
and it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear that there is a</font>

624
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,720
movement to using the technologies not

625
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,590
just to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> and track but to start</font>

626
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,420
to exert some form of control<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

mean arguably with the driverless car

628
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,650
you will have this is this anyway but

629
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,790
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are still on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the route</font>

there try to get insurance if you're not

631
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,090
enabling you know not allowing its

632
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,700
certain degree of monitoring to happen

633
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,949
and you know the I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,350
a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two away from when cars won't</font>

00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,390
start you know if you're too tired or

636
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,669
you've you've consumed certain

637
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,740
substances and so on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

638
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,630
biometric sensors are already in the

639
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,530
cars and they're being being added at a

640
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:26,780
furious pace this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorites</font>

641
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,300
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see I was very keen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

642
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:34,720
looking at how what how artists think

643
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:36,980
about this one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a project from</font>

644
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,190
from colleagues at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> royal college of</font>

645
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:43,640
art you know they said like you know the

646
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:46,070
biometric toilet is the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next logical</font>

647
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,600
step you know and I guess you don't have

648
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell that to Japanese toilet</font>

649
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,480
manufacturers who already incorporates a

650
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,550
huge number of things into the toilet

651
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,570
but let's let me come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that later</font>

652
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">on you know so why is this one is this</font>

653
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:05,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">one so potentially subversive Wow I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

654
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:08,570
the other thing did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know about this</font>

655
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:12,950
type of monitoring engagement pedometers

656
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:14,960
for kids so it pro commercially provided

657
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,410
you know that their providers commercial

658
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,380
providers who monitor the of house kids

659
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:24,290
work of course all in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name of being</font>

660
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to to personalize to target you</font>

661
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,920
know to identify kids before that

662
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,710
lagging behind it's always for the best

663
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,090
intention and this project was partly

664
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,150
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates

665
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,230
Foundation but I mean the Howells from

666
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,929
the from the

667
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,760
teaching establishment in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US you</font>

668
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">know sort of they work quite loud but i</font>

669
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,250
guess like really nobody listens very

670
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,870
much to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two teachers but it's like you</font>

671
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,910
know whether this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps you know</font>

672
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,370
their their protest essentially was like

673
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,929
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think it really helps</font>

674
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,330
learning you know because at the end of

675
00:28:54,929 --> 00:29:00,419
the day you're mostly measuring

676
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,189
activation and concentration but not

677
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,900
really what you're concentrating on and

678
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,000
whether this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> enables actually</font>

679
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,250
learning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> improves skills is a</font>

680
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,230
different question but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies</font>

681
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:16,320
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like Newton k and e</font>

682
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,240
WT om it's basically they are you know

683
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,610
they're they're cheerfully admitting you

684
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,220
know that you know these kids that they

685
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,649
have on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the schools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

686
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,900
supply their services to are the most

687
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,790
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> mined you know forget consumers</font>

688
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,280
they are the most data mined people on

689
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:34,530
the planet because literally everything

690
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,240
they do in in interact in the

691
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,120
interaction and this is what you do when

692
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the input but it is also the</font>

693
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,439
biometrics it's where are you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

694
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:46,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen but then also you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

695
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,049
your pupillary dilation response is no

696
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,250
so that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can I can't can</font>

697
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,760
figure out not just what you're looking

698
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,919
at but I can figure out which things are

699
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,640
emotionally engaging to to you in

700
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular ways and why so so that type</font>

701
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,780
of and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's it's a little bit</font>

702
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,580
worrying that this type of deployment

703
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:09,210
has been allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take place and</font>

704
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really it's not widely the general</font>

705
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,809
public is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely aware of it and</font>

706
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not really really been discussed as</font>

707
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:16,200
i said the teachers have been howling

708
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,440
but as far as i can tell the US public

709
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,240
hasn't really listened to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so what</font>

710
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,740
you hear of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course getting is is you're</font>

711
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,270
now getting this this profusion of data

712
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's being collected from you know an</font>

713
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever-increasing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of devices or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">senses and then the great white hope you</font>

715
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,520
know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the new AI as i call</font>

716
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,669
it you know it's now coming around again

717
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,460
as big data which will save us with with

718
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:44,280
all the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

719
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,840
we're having we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically figure out</font>

720
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,928
you know these connections and we can

721
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,049
figure out how to enable things that

722
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,820
we've deemed to be desired

723
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:56,269
durable and how we stop things that we

724
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,889
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> undesirable one of the things</font>

725
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:00,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really worries me is when you start</font>

726
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:02,418
scratching a little bit it's like the

727
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:06,590
the benefits of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of approach</font>

728
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:09,350
largely are sold on face validity surely

729
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,720
the more data we have the better we know

730
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,949
what's really going on right and a

731
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,629
rescue there's people here in the

732
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,059
audience of done fantastic work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

733
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:18,918
actually show you know that that the the

734
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,690
contrary it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place but in the</font>

735
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,369
discourse that's happening in industry

736
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,679
and the discourse that's happening in

737
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:26,590
government you never hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rightly</font>

738
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're they're basically completely</font>

739
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:32,330
uncritically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more data the</font>

740
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:36,679
better and the more we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

741
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:38,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">start using this in in a way to to stop</font>

00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:39,919
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know undesirable things from</font>

happening you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from becoming obese if we</font>

746
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,769
and so right that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great</font>

747
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:51,350
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is the sort of</font>

748
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:53,989
like the model in in the decision makers

749
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:58,189
headsets driving a lot of this and and

750
00:31:53,989 --> 00:32:00,889
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> debate about the the next step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

751
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:03,379
this the social sorting isn't really

752
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:05,719
happening i think is this incredibly

753
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:08,949
prescient report that the UK data

something violent or criminal or

766
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:44,359
whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is social sorting now so</font>

767
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:46,789
and the insidious part about it is that

768
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:49,609
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> running up against a big stop</font>

770
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:56,029
in most cases is you you suffer

771
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:58,759
exclusion without even realizing it

772
00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:01,490
right you simply will not be offered

773
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:04,000
certain services or options you know you

774

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be presented</font>

775
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,170
with only certain certain options to do

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:13,030
and again that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACLU pizza clip is my 10</font>

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,700

778
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,740
it's still worth listening to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Go Go and</font>

779
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L your pizza</font>

780
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,410
and you'll see it and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial</font>

781
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:26,830
sector this is this happening on a grand

782
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:29,890
scale so the UK is completely postcodes

783
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,659
mind and they are personas there's

784
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,620
basically demographic mapping and

785
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:38,250
personas for each UK postcode so they're

786
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,439
basically have 15 demographic groups and

787
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,630
66 different types and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

788
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,940
just to market your product or you want

789
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sell a service you can very neatly</font>

790
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,920
figure out according to experian that

791
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,780
solves this product which postcodes you

792
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,550
might want to offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> these services to</font>

793
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,790
and where you might want to target your

794
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:59,760
marketing that's one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's also</font>

795
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:03,310
used for instance a big customer

796
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,110
experience as the UK government and they

797
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:08,290
use this for instance to figure out

798
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,319
where to target policing resources they

799
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:14,560
use it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out where to target</font>

800
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,919
leaflets for two to warn against the

801
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,529
dangers of teenage pregnancy and so on

802
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,190
and so the basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> vis this key</font>

803
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:26,230
problem of this this approach is that

804
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of data mining which is</font>

805
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,870
probabilistic techniques are used in a

806
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,000
deterministic way which that report 10

807
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,100
years 10 years ago already pointed out

808
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,780
and that's unfortunately I think

809
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:42,549
becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality I think what the the</font>

810
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,800
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> part to it is if we actually</font>

811
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">dislike that either even if you're aware</font>

812
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,040
of this and you say like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

813
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,339
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to sort of like hot</font>

814
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,070
you know it's taylor with it's becoming

815
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:56,230
increasingly difficult because it's not

816
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,780
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not even required to put</font>

817
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,960
your finger down or to present your face

818
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,420
to a camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> with high-definition camera</font>

819
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,610
and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proliferation of cameras</font>

820
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,780
all you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is walk through a</font>

821
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:13,240
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> area or as my colleagues at the</font>

822
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:17,590
Israel conference basically presented

823
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,049
results from a drone with a highs with

824
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,230
high-definition camera flying over a

825
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,070
crowd and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then with you know with</font>

826
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,860
post-processing later you can identify

827
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,870
every within minutes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know footage</font>

828
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:32,920
collected within a few minutes you can

829
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:37,029
identify thousands of people using using

830
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,560
biometric face recognition so the

831
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so why aren't</font>

832
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,130
people really sort of like like raising

833
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,170
this more as a you know why aren't we

834
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,560
being asked about this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know do we</font>

835
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:53,140
have any any say in this and I want that

836
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,020
I think I can explain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the</font>

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,440
less well-known<font color="#CCCCCC"> adamson's osipova which</font>

838
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:03,370
we published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2001 which was about how</font>

839
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,560
people reason about privacy and what we

840
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,690
pointed out is this fundamental gulf

841
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,110
between how people isn't about privacy

842
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:14,200
and how the law thinks you know about

843
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy so from an individual's point of</font>

844
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,700
view they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at data is either</font>

845
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:22,149
being sensitive or not sensitive you

846
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:24,600
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the whole contextual approach to</font>

847
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,950
thinking that that other authors authors

848
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,370
subsequently formulated more clearly

849
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:31,839
than we did it in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper is very</font>

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,370
very inbuilt to people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're</font>

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,050
very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about is this is a</font>

somebody who I know nothing about is

asking me on the street or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sending me a questionnaire</font>

858
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,339
with a hundred question asking me about

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,080
things you know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are different</font>

860

context and the same piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

861
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,310
information might be judged by the same

person to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive in one context</font>

863
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:59,830
not in another and and the weighing up

864
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,870
that happens then is is it takes place

865
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an essentially economic framework</font>

866
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,990
right so most people are not privacy

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,190
fundamentalists they they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you know</font>

the vast majority of people are

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,210
pragmatic as we call them and so they're

870
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking what are the risks what are the</font>

871
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:19,150
benefits and they are most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people if you</font>

872
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,370
ask them quite cheerfully say yes I for

873
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:24,910
certain benefits I'm prepared to accept

874
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:27,100
certain risks and they're judged that by

875
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,980
looking at you know who who am i giving

876
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,360
this information to and what purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

877
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,620
they going going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

878
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,440
that's essentially their risk calculus

879
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:40,930
the problem with that of course if that

880
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,120
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with with severely</font>

881
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:45,490
restricted imperfect information and

882
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,710
they have cognitive biases that mean

883
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:50,229
they they're doing a pretty lousy job on

884
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,420
the risk assessment the benefits are

885
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,400
immediate and tempting you know and

886
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,430
often very appealing and they they

887
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,890
basically get magnified and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

888
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,080
whole balance that that balance

889
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,790
trade-off that they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

890
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:09,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">making is in reality not taking place</font>

891
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:12,040
and if you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more you're</font>

892
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,810
actually not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even realizing that the</font>

893
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,640
data is being collected and how it's

894
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,500
being used of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you can't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

895
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,930
of these these trade-off decisions that

896
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:23,200
people currently often think you know

897
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are making its again about 20 years</font>

899
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,900
basically pointed out he was pointing

900
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,820
out that these marketing techniques that

901
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,520
are being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sir already 20</font>

00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:40,750
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago in the US they would get</font>

who were bought in a shopping center on

905
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,680
on a Saturday say like<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you'd like</font>

906
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,600
to earn fifty dollars and you fill in a

907
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,609
questionnaire and then they ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

908
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,950
look through some adverts you know some

909
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,560
magazines and that I do I tracking to

910
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,700
basically deploy exactly these things

911
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,460
you know to look where you're looking

912
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,069
but also by your pupillary response

913
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,110
determining how what you're basically

914
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:08,950
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of emotional loading you might</font>

915
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:11,800
have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and etc etc and if that's</font>

916
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,600
then subsequently deployed to to offer

917
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,080
you things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to offer your things at a</font>

918
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,490
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you when they can also</font>

919
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,470
determine from your behavioral

920
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,629
biometrics that you might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tired or</font>

921
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:25,270
that you you know might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a bad mood</font>

922
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that you're suffering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from ego</font>

923
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,560
depletion currently very fashionable to

924
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,620
talk about ego depletion you know when

925
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,750
your willpower has been eroded that's of

926
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">course then all the better to sell you</font>

927
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,550
with now you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> think okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

928
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,700
that's that's kind of mundane but if we

929
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,410
pitch this against the the underlying

930
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,750
trends and developments that

931
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:50,200
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a slightly</font>

932
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,840
slightly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know slightly different</font>

933
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what are the key trends</font>

934
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">urbanization so more people we passed</font>

935
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,750
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the point where more</font>

936
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,180
people live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in cities than in in urban</font>

937
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,350
areas on the planet we have high

938
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:07,240
permeability people are moving around

939
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,610
and whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is temporary or</font>

940
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,740
permanent migration more than ever

941
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:14,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">before and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting pressure on</font>

942
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,930
resources right so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

943
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
they're congregating in certain parts is

944
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,649
putting pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and resources but of</font>

945
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,870
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments face increasing</font>

946
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:25,630
reduction in resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they have we</font>

947
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:28,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall pressure on resources like</font>

948
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:33,070
you know food water energy all these

949
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and it basically makes it</font>

950
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,540
inevitable that gap that governments or

951
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,819
certain bodies who are looking after

952
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:42,900
things have to exert some form of

953
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:45,400
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over those resources</font>

954
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,220
technologies if you if you need to

955
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,100
basically say no to people technology is

956
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,899
great why rather than having to stand up

957
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and face to face say to people know you</font>

958
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,870
can't have this or no you have to pay a

959
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:02,170
lot more for this you know are very if

960
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:04,390
this is basically basically enforced by

961
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,310
technology you've got like a nice sort

962
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:09,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like you know it's I call it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a shield</font>

963
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:11,350
and a veil with behind which you can

964
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,940
hide that decision making and I think

965
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is potentially the creepiest</font>

966
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,190
aspects of it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that some some</font>

967
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:21,610
really fundamental decisions are being

968
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,860
made in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this kind of covert way</font>

969
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,140
because the reasoning<font color="#E5E5E5"> is let's not wake</font>

970
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,960
Sleeping Dogs you know if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

971
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,640
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dis nice paternalism and steer</font>

972
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,310
people towards the correct behavior

973
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,870
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology you know then we</font>

974
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the difficult</font>

975
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:42,190
discussions there is also of course an

976
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:45,190
industry that's that's developed this

977
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,290
kind of technology which with actually

978
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,250
shrinking or at least up until now we

979
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:54,130
had a period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where the the market for</font>

980
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:57,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Battlefield technology was decreasing</font>

981
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,090
and so they have very much looked at you

982
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,370
know

983
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,350
basically deploying the kind of

984
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:05,440
monitoring the sensor technologies

985
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:08,350
they've developed for for military

986
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,280
purposes in these urban environments you

987
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:15,310
know smart cities a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff is</font>

988
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,550
military technology and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

989
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:20,770
the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this it's also we are</font>

990
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:24,250
partly doing it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been a</font>

991
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:26,320
fashion for adopting certain of these

992
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,800
military techniques as consumers you

993
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,110
know basically Humvees and and various

994
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,970
other kinds of things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so I</font>

995
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:36,040
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into the</font>

996
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:40,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">various psychological reasons that drive</font>

997
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:43,120
this but it's very much becoming where

998
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:47,230
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power essentially starts to</font>

999
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:49,270
lie with with those who can who operate

1000
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:52,060
the technologies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have that</font>

1001
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:54,550
that kind of data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> stephen graham</font>

1002
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,950
basic he calls this the new new military

1003
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:00,730
urban is you know and we've already had

1004
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:03,339
the first few drones<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down in area</font>

1005
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:07,210
yeah because because the friction that's

1006
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:10,540
resulting from this is coming coming to

1007
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the coming to the fore so it's again</font>

1008
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,860
it's like that kind of technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1009
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,950
again used as part of a social sorting

1010
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,990
movement where you're you're basically

1011
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:23,350
profiling and in for selectively

1012
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:27,549
enforcing certain certain things on

1013
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:29,860
people and the the less these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1014
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:32,080
kind of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> approaches are actually</font>

1015
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:35,520
questioned and debated because they

1016
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,080
regarded just as being police technical

1017
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,660
you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of discussions</font>

1018
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,520
nobody ever asks the population in the

1019
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,379
UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance whether they want all</font>

1020
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,130
those you know that we've never had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1021
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:50,350
referendum on cameras and automatic

1022
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:53,470
number plate recognition and now adding

1023
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:54,880
to this automatic face recognition and

1024
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">whenever in fact once when the</font>

1025
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,120
Department of Transport wrote to a

1026
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,790
selection of people whose number plates

1027
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,740
that captured on a motorway on a Sunday

1028
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,630
afternoon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked them why they were</font>

00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">driving there you know there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1030
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:10,630
absolute uproar and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what is this yeah so</font>

1032
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:16,000
if this is sort of like like happen

1033
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:18,490
could happen in covertly I think it's

1034
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,579
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it's very worrying</font>

1035
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:24,250
particularly with if you add back

1036
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:26,650
behavioral biometrics to this you know

1037
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,000
it's very very tempting<font color="#E5E5E5"> when when the</font>

1038
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:32,009
government is faced<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is shrinking</font>

1039
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,009
resources to try and find ways of

1040
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,069
handling this in a way that doesn't

1041
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:41,230
require you know very open public debate

1042
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:43,089
and having to say no to people why

1043
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,519
because her saying no to people is bad

1044
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:47,589
for politicians and so we're basically

1045
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,439
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this look like you know</font>

1046
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:54,430
operational technical things and and and

1047
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,200
deploying this so from a company point

1048
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:59,430
of view you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can offer your</font>

1049
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,899
irresistible kind of kind of things and

1050
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,029
as I already said the boundaries are

1051
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,309
eroding right between because the

1052
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:11,349
government buys these services and buys

1053
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:14,259
the data from the commercial sector and

1054
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:16,869
the government is selling the data it

1055
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:18,970
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying in many</font>

1056
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:20,920
countries to sell the data that it has

1057
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:24,129
whether this is health databases you

1058
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,500
know genomic data transport data already

1059
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,890
is sold on a massive scale is either

1060
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:34,450
sold or given to two industries to to

1061
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:36,910
use mighty backfire and I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1066
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:47,950
point of view or he basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> then takes</font>

1067
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:51,400
it to the next step in<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme where he</font>

1068
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:54,038
says if you are manipulating consumers

1069
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,809
and citizens on this scale you know

1070
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,210
because essentially you know when you

1071
00:45:55,809 --> 00:46:00,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get them to to agree or do certain</font>

1072
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,079
things if you just catch them at the

<font color="#CCCCCC">right moment and target essentially you</font>

destroy the market and he argues that's

1075
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:10,359
the end of capitalism and you know

1076
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,309
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes next go and watch this</font>

1085
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:34,440
potentially really dystopian scenario a

little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mundane and the</font>

to people<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is about things that</font>

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:53,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't understand is that they</font>

manage their relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> with others</font>

1094
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:59,250
through selective disclosure of

information and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1096
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:05,089
ability to do that you get fewer

00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:08,849
relationships you get more conflict I

1098
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:12,180
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one example so a colleague of</font>

1099
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:14,579
mine sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gave me a lift somewhere</font>

1100
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:17,819
but he had to do the weekly shopping on

1101
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:19,859
the way and then so absurd traipse too

1102
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:21,930
long and he put all his shopping through

1103
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:24,779
put her down the supermarket loyalty

1104
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:28,109
can't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card and paid</font>

1105
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:29,849
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all his shopping and then you put</font>

1106
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">down three packs of chocolate biscuits</font>

1107
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:36,359
and paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in cash I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going like</font>

1108
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:37,890
do you have helped I didn't realize this

1109
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:39,779
supermarket dust health insurance as

1110
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:43,140
well because I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1111
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:47,460
supermarket know what who cares he cares

1112
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:50,190
about his wife because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wife will</font>

1113
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,049
basically get the receipt and you know

1114
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:55,140
and the thing and so it turns out he

1115
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:59,130
tells me this story that his wife is a

1116
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:01,410
bit of a health food maniac right as he

1117
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,960
and his two daughters see it you know

1118
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,808
she she they think she's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme</font>

1119
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,720
she won't allow shop-bought biscuits or

1120
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:11,849
cakes in the house right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> afters</font>

1121
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,769
after a couple of years of arguments

1122
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:17,250
about this and so on they they kind of

1123
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:19,769
like reached a you know an agreement

1124
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,599
where the kids were my friend and and

1125
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:23,788
the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> daughters basically said fine we</font>

1126
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,619
won't have the cakes and biscuits when

1127
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:26,819
we're at home because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just trigger</font>

1128
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,559
these massive rather than these

1129
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:30,660
arguments and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really agreeing</font>

1130
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,660
on this but basically we'll get our own

1131
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,490
back by having secret biscuit fests you

1132
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,049
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car or when we go out for</font>

1133
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:39,959
what

1134
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:42,540
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually think that is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

1135
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,860
this is we do this hundreds of times in

1136
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,410
the way of how we manage relationships

1137
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:50,340
you know within our<font color="#CCCCCC"> family with our</font>

1138
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:52,649
neighbors and at work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know within</font>

1139
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the social communities that that we have</font>

1140
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:59,040
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1141
00:48:54,870 --> 00:49:00,960
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye-bye</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by doing this and I think</font>

1142
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the really key things we need to</font>

1143
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,250
do is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people to understand this</font>

1144
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:07,980
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is it's not you know</font>

1145
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:10,560
that this is the the privacy security

1146
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,140
trade off being pushed and so it's not

1147
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,570
it goes to privacy is really

1148
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:19,410
fundamentally important to your to your

1149
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:22,980
process things so when people realize

1150
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:24,990
you know that that their privacy is

1151
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,330
being eroded and this is detrimental to

1152
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:30,779
them we have the research from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

1153
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:32,759
55 ish years you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do engage</font>

1154
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,650
in privacy protection behaviors and

1155
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,490
they're even<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to take a certain</font>

1156
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:40,710
amount of effort over this with

1157
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:42,390
behavioral biometrics my concern is that

1158
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,580
the kind of things that people do online

1159
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:47,040
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically just inventing your</font>

1160
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">date of birth or inventing another</font>

1161
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,630
persona and so on that with behavioral

1162
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:53,460
biometrics these these traditional

1163
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:56,490
privacy protection behaviors are being

1164
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,320
eroded another one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also is</font>

1165
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,939
particularly Dana Boyd's research

1166
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,890
pointed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> teenagers who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1167
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,540
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> held up as the ones who don't care</font>

1168
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,819
about privacy actually have very

1169
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated privacy protection</font>

1170
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,740
behaviors<font color="#E5E5E5"> no they went what their post</font>

1171
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,930
online basically has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

1172
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,910
different meaning to them than it has to

1173
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,640
their parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> or teachers who they are</font>

1174
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:20,220
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect their privacy from you</font>

1175
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,950
know and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically develop various</font>

1176
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:27,080
techniques techniques quite well that's

1177
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:29,549
great and there's other forms from the

1178
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,730
security and human behavior workshop

1179
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:34,770
this year we had the artist Adam Harvey

1180
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:36,750
basically presenting us with various

1181
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:41,480
things such as you know this emptied

1182
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:44,580
concepts like the ante drone burka or

1183
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:48,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically hair and using hair and</font>

1184
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:50,880
makeup to fool face detection so his

1185
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,310
argument is if you understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

1186
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,120
pros

1187
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:57,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing works you can actually deploy</font>

1188
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,920
these things to stop it you know to

1189
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:02,020
basically stop it from working some

1190
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,740
lovely thoughts there and look forward

1191
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to my students basically looking with</font>

1192
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:10,330
whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is enough I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think with the</font>

1193
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,830
rise of behavior biometrics and the

1194
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:14,080
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> between all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

1195
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:17,170
types of data if you look at projects

1196
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,460
like super identities where you know

1197
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:21,100
they're they're tracking people down

1198
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:24,580
just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know by measuring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bye-bye if</font>

1199
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:26,860
you are a you're a USA a pedophile

1200
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:30,370
perpetrator and you just carelessly had

1201
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:32,290
a bit of your hand caught on video you

1202
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,390
know what they've demonstrated is by

1203
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,100
combining these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of physical</font>

1204
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,660
measurements and tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> all my</font>

1205
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,299
behavior they can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font>

1206
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:42,100
these people track them down I think we

1207
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,810
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know the privacy protection</font>

1208
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,720
behaviors would need to become

1209
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:50,170
sophisticated to a degree but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is</font>

1210
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,660
you know it's impossible and and that

1211
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:55,870
basically really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why it's necessary</font>

1212
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:59,230
to bring the this basically out into the

1213
00:51:55,870 --> 00:52:01,029
open and really discuss and and and make

1214
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,590
it clear to people how this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

1215
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,750
used you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

1216
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">population that that extraordinary</font>

1217
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:10,570
statement you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we kill people based</font>

1218
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:12,760
on metadata and you know and then you

1219
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">know can we please consider the ack you</font>

1220
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,660
know and if you consider the accuracy of

1221
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:19,359
it as Christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have an aquatic</font>

1222
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:21,310
pointed out in their recent article it's

1223
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sort of like quite quite worrying</font>

1224
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:27,220
so to finish this is you know we know

1225
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,770
technology as a profound impact on

1226
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:33,250
privacy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the fact that most</font>

1227
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,050
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand that privacy is</font>

1228
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,600
important in how technology influences

1229
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:41,380
it is now becoming a pretty urgent

1230
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:44,560
problem because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1231
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:47,040
able to to get any any public discourse

1232
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:51,670
about this is if we don't get a broader

1233
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,110
you know decoration off of people that

1234
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">people say like no you know we're not</font>

1235
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:57,940
okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and we want this to be</font>

1236
00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:01,930
depart I think it's very important to to

1237
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:04,510
bust you know to to to address this that

1238
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk-benefit trade-offs that there</font>

1239
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,730
may

1240
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,990
and to inform people more clearly that

1241
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,630
they're basically quite quite

1242
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:12,098
misconceived and in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve</font>

1243
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:14,230
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get better at</font>

1244
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:18,369
communicating about this why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

1245
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">be communicating you know in in terms of</font>

1246
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:21,400
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to help people to</font>

1247
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,710
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the benefits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are being</font>

1248
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,200
oversold you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very often it</font>

1249
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,090
isn't as accurate no actually as a

1250
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,480
result of all this cameras the crime

1251
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:34,359
rate in your area didn't go down and it

1252
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,920
saturates at right now if you only if

1253
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:40,900
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for the evidence it's there and</font>

1254
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the artists and social</font>

1255
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,119
scientists can help us to basically

1256
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:48,310
explained this in ways that actually

1257
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:50,530
touch people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people's judgment</font>

1258
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:53,080
more and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to become more</font>

1259
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,450
creative in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things you</font>

1260
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,098
know thinking about unionization

1261
00:53:54,450 --> 00:54:00,189
consumer unionization certainly you know

1262
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:02,800
consumer organizations you need more

1263
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">support civil disobedience even you know</font>

1264
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a lovely example from</font>

1265
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,730
Germany in the 1970s when people know

1266
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,400
the data protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER was introduced as</font>

1267
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:15,490
a result of civil disobedience action

1268
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,800
where people refused to complete the

1269
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:19,839
survey and they boycotted it in a very

1270
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,180
creative way they're all basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1271
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,070
activists volunteered<font color="#E5E5E5"> a census collect</font>

1272
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,549
data collectors and then they all found

1273
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:29,589
in sick on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> census thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right if</font>

1274
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,690
you sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and think about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

1275
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:34,960
actually ways of how you can stop mass

1276
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:36,820
data collection happening the other part

1277
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,270
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very final</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fight on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

1278
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:42,339
I finish is is that it can it might

1279
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:44,800
happen even in the most you know what

1280
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:47,830
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> think banal mb nine places you</font>

1281
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,690
know that increasingly you know one of

1282
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:52,720
the reactions might be is there people

1283
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:55,480
act on a very very localized basis and

1284
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,368
start to to enforce certain things you

1285
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,200
know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is to have drowned</font>

1286
00:54:57,369 --> 00:55:01,780
free zones or camera free zones are

1287
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,730
starting to provide their own internet

1288
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:07,270
service with their own kind of controls

1289
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:10,119
and only releasing aggregated data to

1290
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,950
select at service providers there is

1291
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:13,510
potential things we can do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1292
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of it more broadly</font>

1293
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:19,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how we deal with the privacy</font>

1294
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:23,430
implications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are coming with this</font>

1295
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,430
technology thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
