00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,070
we then also showed our participants

110
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,640

their right to access credit information

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,370

<font color="#E5E5E5">about how aware users are about access</font>

172
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,300
we asked users whether they believed

access laws in there

174

181
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,139

believe their rights are on par with

broader in scope it could even be argued

188
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:18,879
Irish people have more access than

189
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:21,940
Americans so turning to look at the

190
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,979
interest section of our work we asked

191

200
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,229
from the graph participants from both

201
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:50,080
jurisdictions see accesses a right with

202
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,240
and small percentages disagreeing when

203
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,550
asked why the participants answers that

204
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,680
they did the most popular sentiment was

205
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,639
it is my data so there's very much a

206

right and attitude<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards access we</font>

207
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,500
then asked a more concrete and personal

question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to users if they had an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reasoning people answered so strongly</font>

214
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,099
that they would use an access right was

215
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,289
to see what data has been collected

216
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:25,090
about them by companies and the second

usage rates for these tools are

232

extremely low and we asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

participants and eighteen percent of

237

Americans reporting using it but we

238
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,390
might expect that our self-reported data

239
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,430
is astonishingly high for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> results</font>

240
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,550
because industry reports of cited lower

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,650
rates so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving on to the proposed</font>

242
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,959
systems and this is the first of three

<font color="#E5E5E5">and images we present it to our</font>

expanded version which will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to in</font>

248
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,790
a moment this scaled-down system is

249
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,740
largely what we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before a simple</font>

250
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,650
add category assignment but nothing more

251
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,930
when we asked participants if they would

252
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,550
find it to like this useful sixty-four

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the expanded system and this is</font>

again showing you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest category</font>

258
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,680
but what differs about this tool is you

can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a basis for interest and in a</font>
