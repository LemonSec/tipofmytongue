00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,160
enhancing technologies hot pets 2016 I'd

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,609
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce the people behind the</font>

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">program today in some sense I had some</font>

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,369
great co-chairs that helped put together

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,600
this workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saudi off rose from XE who</font>

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,509
was unfortunately not able to be here

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">today and also more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bartel of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Renewable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Freedom Foundation who is over</font>

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so you can thank him or blame him</font>

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,980
and then there's myself from the US

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:43,309
Naval<font color="#E5E5E5"> Research Laboratory so the three</font>

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:49,980
of us kind of did everything so if you

15
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:53,280
have any complaints or you know well

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">wishes or compliments you know you can</font>

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,410
blame the three of us we kind of did

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,870
everything from publicizing to deciding

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,179
the papers to putting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,589
deciding what goes on the website so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,490
was kind of all rolled into one from us

22
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I kind of wanted to explain what</font>

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,350
Hot Heads is as opposed to pets um it

24
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,149
was a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of if it was not hot</font>

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,830
enough yet this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we really want</font>

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get hotter so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will it's</font>

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,810
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get hotter and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll</font>

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,280
enjoy it so yeah there wasn't actually a

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,820
proposal for cool pets that may appear

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">in future years but not this year so we</font>

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,548
had some set we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some separate goals</font>

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,890
or slightly different goals from hot

33
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,979
pets one is that we try to present new

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,640
ideas more um we provide prioritize that

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,799
more or less mature work we're open to

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,659
and even invite people to present so

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can give ideas before it's</font>

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,659
fully formed and would appear in a

39
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,079
journal for example so you can get

40
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,750
feedback or so people can get early

41
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,189
early results also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to be</font>

42
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,009
accessible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communities that don't</font>

43
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,110
typically publish academic papers so if

44
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,570
you're a journalist or you write code

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,610
for a living you might not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or</font>

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,408
really know how to write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15-page</font>

47
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,750
proceedings of privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can have</font>

48
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,160
technology symposium paper but if you

49
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,870
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach this community and you'd</font>

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,470
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hotpads</font>

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,870
is a great

52
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,180
for you to submit to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked for a</font>

53
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,380
two page proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> just telling us what</font>

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,020
you're going to talk about and we're

55
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,150
open to any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> format you don't</font>

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,010
need to have references so we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

57
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,010
accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little beyond the core</font>

58
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,470
audience of academics to mix communities

59
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,450
a bit how we also prioritize group

60
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,100
discussions so we have a fairly long

61
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,769
time for each talk at least relative to

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,079
this year's pets 25 minutes but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

63
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> authors to only use a part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve a great deal of that for</font>

65
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to talk so I know there are lots</font>

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,950
of the individual discussions that

67
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,510
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> during the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week I mean there are</font>

68
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,660
some questions that happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> during the</font>

69
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,579
pets talks but we give a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more time</font>

70
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,370
so that you can you know have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute back and forth if there's enough</font>

72
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,140
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your individual question and as</font>

73
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,040
a group<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hear what other</font>

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,609
people think and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's value</font>

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,920
to that and also uh we're sort of a

76
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,230
little trying to have fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look trying</font>

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,350
to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little more relaxed here at hot</font>

78
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,359
pets so in that spirit I thought I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

79
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,910
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you some analogies for the</font>

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,250
difference between pets and hot pets if

81
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,040
the raw facts didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,680
message across<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so pets might be</font>

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,859
more like the family dog<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's dependable</font>

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,470
you know he's reliable and he's around

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,920
for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we're hot pets might be</font>

86
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,370
more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> your cute new puppy he's more</font>

87
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,089
rambunctious he makes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

88
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,299
noise but he has his own you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know unique</font>

89
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,430
value another analogy you could say pets

90
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,700
is like the awesome power of the dark

91
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,530
side Darth Vader you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy</font>

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,268
whose power you can't deny<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going to</font>

93
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,400
take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and rule universe with an iron</font>

94
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,840
fist wear hot pants might be more like

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,180
kylo Ren the force awakens villain who

96
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,120
is in Adonai bleep our fall on his own

97
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,970
right but as a little more impetuous and

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,840
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of control it safe on a</font>

99
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,840
final analogy

100
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,089
pets might be the esteemed chair of

101
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,029
computer science our professor chaired

102
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:24,840
professor of computer science at a very

103
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:29,760
highly esteemed University in 2016 we're

104
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:36,030
hot pets might be year 2000 brilliant

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:38,580
sniper punky<font color="#CCCCCC"> and over okay so some</font>

106
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,690
logistics here to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this whole</font>

107
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,180
thing works so you know what you're

108
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,550
seeing we did ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two page talks</font>

109
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,800
emissions so we just ask people tell us

110
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they were going to say and we only</font>

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,039
do talks there aren't any proceedings

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,660
this allows you to just talk about

113
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then publish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it elsewhere</font>

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,160
we want all allow that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the decision</font>

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">was made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by just the coaches there</font>

116
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,580
wasn't a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big pc it's just the three of</font>

117
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:06,270
us so it's kind of ruled by of you know

118
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,669
triumvirate<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i'd also like to</font>

119
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,310
suggest how we do fit into hot pets

120
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:13,919
publishing how you might work hot pets

121
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">into your PO pets submission eventually</font>

122
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,359
so on the right we can see the possibly

123
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,030
tortuous life cycle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> april</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pets</font>

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,860
submission all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> through major</font>

125
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,469
revisions to maybe minor revisions to

126
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,930
hopefully accept and so you could see

127
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,330
hot pets as a parallel option yet

128
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be judged by your</font>

129
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,359
peers which is always great but it has

130
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,800
some separate properties so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's some you know</font>

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,590
mutually beneficial effects that can

133
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,830
happen here so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to consider</font>

134
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're currently not accepted or about</font>

135
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,639
to be accepted papers in the pets um and

136
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,560
we hope that that happens sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

137
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,090
you can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if your paper didn't</font>

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,590
get the decision that it wants if we

139
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,520
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would make a good hot pets</font>

140
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,349
talk and then in the reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we hope</font>

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,549
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could serve as initial starting</font>

142
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:06,840
point for ideas that do make it into a

143
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,180
pope has paper at some point and this

144
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,590
might be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to show those</font>

145
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,979
initial ideas and get some feedback

146
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:18,119
before you turn it over to the

147
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:21,240
terrifying reviewers ok so the logistics

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,150
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> schedule today we selected nine</font>

149
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,790
talks we got 29 submissions that was a

150
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,789
d % increase over last year so our

151
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,530
acceptance rate is getting a bit low I

152
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,090
was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> my hope to make this a highly</font>

153
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,570
selective very difficult to get into

154
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,869
venue<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if this trend continues you</font>

155
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,250
know future chairs may consider changing

156
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,650
the format increasing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

157
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,290
talks or something like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that</font>

158
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,260
is happening we're giving 25 minutes a

159
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,030
talk three-fifths of which we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

163
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,570
encourage people to ask questions so for

164
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,180
this workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have set up to mikes</font>

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">one on both sides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the room so you</font>

166
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,050
don't have to traipse across the entire

167

aisle or when your way around the entire

room to get to in your nearby<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic so</font>

169
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,810
hopefully that makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font>

170
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,330
to just jump up when you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

171
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,910
and add it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the discussion so please</font>

feel free to and please do use both mics

has to say I've only read the abstract

180
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,060
just as you have but I've heard really

181

183
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,810
knows him quite well and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he</font>

184
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">brings it really valuable an interesting</font>

activist as a journalist and now as a

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,780
I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking forward to what he</font>

191
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,760
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say right before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lunch similar to</font>

192

193
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,950
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them will not and we've asked on</font>

194
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,270
the video geographers not to record<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

195
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,370
question-and-answer session that happens

196
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the talk so that the discussion</font>

197
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,240
can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more open a little less</font>

198
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,210
self-conscious so that should not be

199
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,640
recorded at all we have a tradition at

200
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,560
hot pets of having an ice cream break I

201
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,080
guess this would fall into the fun

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,310
category<font color="#CCCCCC"> you check ice cream so that</font>

203
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,380
will happen right before the last

204
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">session so you can look forward to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

205
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,850
and save room for some delicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice</font>

206
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,860
cream also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tradition that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have is</font>

207
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,080
we give a best talk award this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

208
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,240
audience vote award

209
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,730
and the criteria that we are asking for

210
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,550
is what was the best talk not

211
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,530
necessarily what ideas do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think will</font>

212
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,599
make you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest impact in the</font>

213
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,339
world or are solving the most difficult

214
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,940
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> although that would certainly</font>

215
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,290
you know suggest a talk could be very

216
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,840
effective but we would like to reward

217
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,400
people who put an effort into giving a

218
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">good talk and that's something that</font>

219
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,959
doesn't always happen or maybe

220
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,970
rightfully as a lower priority for

221
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,490
highly technical works but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are trying</font>

222
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a talk format so please think</font>

223
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,410
while you're listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the talks</font>

224
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,300
today which one which one or ones you

225
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,640
liked and then there'll be a chance to

226
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,569
vote during the concluding remarks we

227
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,939
have a mystery prize that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

228
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:27,750
theme appropriate and you will see what

229
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:30,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is at the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with that I'm</font>
