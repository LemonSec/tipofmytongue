1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,049
ok so I'm Fred I'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,990
salmon which is this is a volunteer

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,410
proxy based system for internet

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,820
censorship second<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention right so to</font>

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,000
start off let me just really quickly

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,189
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the problem we're dealing</font>

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,470
with and the general approach we're

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,050
going to take so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,640
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide Internet access</font>

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,420
to people who are living<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,340
censorship and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do it by</font>

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,649
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them just direct VPN</font>

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,760
servers to connect through and so the

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,649
way the sensor is going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight</font>

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to discover those servers and</font>

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,700
block them so this isn't something like

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,968
a decoy<font color="#CCCCCC"> reading or domain fronting where</font>

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,260
we're sort of just um make doing

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,450
something to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor just can't deal</font>

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,710
with rather where we're doing something

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the sensor totally could block</font>

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,910
we're just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them all</font>

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:02,730
right um so it's the most important

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:04,259
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like most important part of the</font>

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,460
threat model that we should keep in mind

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we're talking about this is that</font>

27
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,119
we're assuming for for what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">be talking about in this presentation so</font>

29
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,820
there's there's more in the paper that

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,789
goes more into their real-world stuff

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,320
but for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithms stuff I'm going</font>

32
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,780
to be talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we're assuming</font>

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,839
that the sensor can only block our proxy

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,369
servers if we give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them so we</font>

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,280
have this distribution mechanism which

36
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,310
is what we're evaluating and the sensor

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,750
can only block our servers if we have

38
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,549
mistakenly intentionally handed them out

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,470
to them now in the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

40
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,799
is you know traffic fingerprinting like

41
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,150
cookies that they might other other

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,950
things they could do to maybe discover

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,439
our dresses we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that in a bit</font>

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,899
in the paper um so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm just</font>

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,850
glossing over it but for what I'm

46
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,220
talking about here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're assuming that</font>

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,630
this is just a it's basically just a

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,630
game we're playing with the sensor oh

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,199
you know how are they going to behave in

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,560
our system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and does that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let them block</font>

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:09,140
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so with that what me</font>

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,730
before we go into the theoretical

53
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,349
algorithm stuff when we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk at</font>

54
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,799
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about the system that</font>

55
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font>

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,180
actually designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deployed so as I</font>

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,370
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is its VPN server based so the</font>

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,070
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing revolves around we have a</font>

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,890
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people volunteering to run</font>

60
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,870
VPN servers similarly to tour people

61
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,480
volunteering to run relay servers and

62
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,850
maybe you know hidden bridges and exit

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">nodes and stuff and we're disturbing</font>

64
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:42,450
these out to users and this that is the

65
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,870
distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's important here so</font>

66
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,220
if we just give the whole list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

67
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,930
servers out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who asks for it</font>

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,760
obviously the server can come along ask

69
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,110
for the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and block all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

70
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,489
servers so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is um hand</font>

71
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,760
out just a few servers at a time and

72
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:04,050
keep track of what is happening when we

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,260
give what servers to whom all right now

74
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,960
we so the the entity doing all of this

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,670
logic the tracking the volunteer server

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,030
is tracking the users and giving service

77
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,250
to users it's just a centralized server

78
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,050
again this is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something that</font>

79
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,630
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good target for the sensor to</font>

80
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,430
block so we need some way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

81
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first place we just</font>

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,620
have built into our client we have

83
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,170
machinery for for them to for the

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,959
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests to get tunneled through</font>

85
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,690
an encrypted email provider like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gmail</font>

86
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,459
or something or any other encrypted

87
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,320
provider that isn't blocked in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users</font>

88
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,680
country because gmail is not necessarily

89
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,739
good choice for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right um now</font>

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,450
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flass thing i should say before</font>

91
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">we move on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual algorithm stuff</font>

92
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,970
is the most important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk of</font>

93
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,580
this real world stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

94
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">need some sort of barrier to entry</font>

95
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,920
because we can have we can talk about

96
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,800
these you know interesting algorithms

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,869
for sussing out who's a sensor agent and

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,150
who's not but all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> falls apart</font>

99
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,430
completely if the sensor can just insert

100
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,530
as many fake identities as it wants into

101
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,040
the system because then they can have

102
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,870
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times as many fake users as</font>

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,519
there are real users and there's no way

104
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know no matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how smart your</font>

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,200
algorithm is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

106
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,880
overwhelmed so we we try to

107
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,380
establish this this foundation for our

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,450
system this barrier to entry to keep to

109
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep the fake identities to a minimum at</font>

110
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,490
least by requiring either that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

111
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,340
present presents us with a plausible

112
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:46,070
looking facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> account or that they</font>

113
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,869
get recommended by a user already<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our</font>

114
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,370
system whom we already trust I'm going

115
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be talking pretty soon about what</font>

116
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,110
trust means to us so for the face for

117
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook account checking what we do</font>

118
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,410
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is we just</font>

119
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,720
require the account to have been created

120
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">before a certain date so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sensor</font>

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,380
can't just come along<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make a bunch</font>

122
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,260
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook accounts and also to have</font>

123
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,450
some posts on it so that's that's a

124
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,630
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple that's pretty simple</font>

125
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,920
approach you could imagine much more

126
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,570
sophisticated things like some sort of

127
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,030
machine learning to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh does this</font>

128
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,170
look like a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> page or not um those</font>

129
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,320
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that could be added to</font>

130
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:24,590
basically strengthen the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

131
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,040
with all that let me now move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

132
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual the algorithm the distribution</font>

133
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,470
algorithm that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center of this</font>

134
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,800
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this this</font>

135
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:40,870
distribution algorithm comprises three

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,820
components there's suspicion trust and

137
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,010
recommendation grouping so the suspicion

138
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,060
is kind of the suspicion suspicion is

139
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,080
the the foundation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything um and</font>

140
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,850
it's this is the the logic of banning

141
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,900
people from our system who we suspect

142
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,060
might be actually working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the sensor</font>

143
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,500
trying to discover servers so basically

144
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,590
what we're going to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

145
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,190
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of you keep</font>

146
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,659
track of what servers we gave you and

147
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,219
you know if your server gets blocked or

148
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,900
like all right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only</font>

149
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,730
person on that server there are also

150
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,830
these other people so all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

151
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,400
on this block server we suspect you know

152
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,740
maybe it was you and after any given

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,719
user has witnessed enough of these

154
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,280
server blocks had servers blocked while

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
they were assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them we're</font>

156
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,059
eventually going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,380
there's a good chance your agent of the

158
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,090
sensor so we're going to ban you<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

159
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,850
the system you know they're gone you're

160
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,650
never coming back um so this clearly

161
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,830
there's there's collateral collateral

162
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,169
damage going on

163
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,469
we end up banning some fraction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

164
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:50,010
users that's bad obviously it's

165
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,780
inevitable for this approach but on the

166
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">bright side we're also permanently</font>

167
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,570
beyond any agents of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensor which</font>

168
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,909
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if if we are managing to</font>

169
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,640
limit the sensors identity creation so

170
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,630
that they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep creating</font>

171
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,460
inserting as many identities as they

172
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,890
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever if they have some finite</font>

173
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,200
supply of identities even though they

174
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,640
get some of our users band they're also

175
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,310
eventually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just get wiped out</font>

176
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,010
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and the attack is over so</font>

177
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,880
that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's the suspicion</font>

178
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:24,960
component<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the thing that really the</font>

179
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:29,040
thing that makes salmon effective and

180
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,169
makes it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it effective is this</font>

181
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,300
trust level logic this is actually just

182
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,630
as a phone aside this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the system</font>

183
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:40,820
is named after we call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> salmon because</font>

184
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:42,780
the we have these trust levels of art so

185
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,349
first i should say what they are then

186
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:49,919
i'll say why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed that all right so</font>

187
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:52,950
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea of trust that's</font>

188
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically if you have been using our</font>

189
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,060
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while and the service we</font>

190
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,000
assigned you have not<font color="#CCCCCC"> been getting</font>

191
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,610
blocked then we're gonna say<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,590
we trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're</font>

193
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,120
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> causing trouble so far so we're</font>

194
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,940
going to trust you more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

195
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,750
goes on and we quantify that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> discreet</font>

196
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,340
trust levels so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

197
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,680
the system for a while without blocking

198
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:22,919
your servers you'll go up a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

199
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:24,870
level up level<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and so we call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,670
salmon<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's like salmon sort of</font>

201
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,590
hopping up levels in a waterfall and

202
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:32,940
maybe falling back down servers get

203
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,699
blocked all right and finally we so we

204
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,930
also as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier you can get into</font>

205
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system if someone who's highly</font>

206
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,909
trusted recommends you this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

207
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,770
issue if this can be an issue if the

208
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,839
sensor just gets is patient enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

209
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,300
get a group of its users<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the top</font>

210
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,670
level and then start recommending people

211
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,670
in and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get exponential growth of</font>

212
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,300
their their network that way which would

213
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,949
just completely

214
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:01,709
defeat us so to defeat to stop that we

215
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,390
group people together with the people

216
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:07,319
they recommend or who recommended them

217
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:10,500
so if if you think of if you look at all

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,829
of our users on you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a forest</font>

219
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,930
of based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with links being</font>

220
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:17,790
recommendations and so each tree in this

221
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,060
forest will always be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same server</font>

222
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,469
so if you have a tree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bunch of</font>

223
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensory agents who recommended each</font>

224
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,480
other they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on</font>

225
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,518
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same server and so they're spending</font>

226
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,140
all of their you know they're all going

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get banned just to block a couple of</font>

228
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,560
servers and on the other side of that

229
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,600
coin um if you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

230
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,518
users they're going to be on a server

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
together and it's just them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

232
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,790
server so they're never going to get

233
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,959
their server blocked that's good all

234
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:51,689
right so um that these trust levels are

235
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:53,518
you you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> promoted with exponential</font>

236
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,149
eight times so it takes two days to get

237
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> first level been four days etc so to</font>

238
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:00,300
get from the very entry level all the

239
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,510
way to the top is going to take a

240
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,740
hundred twenty-eight days<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so aside</font>

241
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,300
from the fact that it just gives you a

242
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,120
nice long wait time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get all the way</font>

243
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top the exponential the specific</font>

244
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,230
distribution means that even if your

245
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,790
user base was growing exponentially

246
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,560
you're still going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice even</font>

247
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,719
spread among the trust levels of your

248
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,649
users which is important because I mean

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,089
if you had um if you had everyone the

250
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,670
same trust level obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like you</font>

251
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">just didn't half-dressed levels right so</font>

252
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,729
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just just want to quickly show</font>

253
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,920
this is what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why trust</font>

254
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,100
levels are beneficial so if we just take

255
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,089
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole salmon design and stable them</font>

256
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:44,760
the in the work with you basically get

257
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,130
double or triple the number of innocent

258
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,060
users who get banned from the system or

259
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:53,699
other or cut off<font color="#E5E5E5"> from servers um and</font>

260
00:10:50,060 --> 00:11:00,229
with them it does much better um one

261
00:10:53,699 --> 00:11:04,589
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright skip this</font>

262
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,120
okay um and all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that was</font>

263
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,430
just comparing sort of comparing the

264
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,320
performance of the system to a crippled

265
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:15,150
version of itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should also</font>

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,690
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is this is a</font>

267
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,990
comparison to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous best work our</font>

268
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,700
bridge which is effectively sort of a

269
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,130
it's effectively the suspicion component

270
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,890
of salmon alone it kind of goes about a

271
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,890
different way but it ends up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being the</font>

272
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:35,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">same sort of philosophy so we also do a</font>

273
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,360
good deal better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that and finally</font>

274
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,190
this recommendation grouping just to

275
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,850
demonstrate how bad it would be if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

276
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,590
weren't doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so on on the left this</font>

277
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario where the sensor has been</font>

278
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,030
patient and let a bunch of what a bunch

279
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,530
of its agents<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up to the up to the</font>

280
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,390
level the top level where they're able

281
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend people then bring a few</font>

282
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,550
people you each each identity brings a

283
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,839
few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't do this</font>

284
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,969
recommendation<font color="#CCCCCC"> group pain they're able</font>

285
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to basically completely shut down the</font>

286
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,290
system um whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do have the</font>

287
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,650
