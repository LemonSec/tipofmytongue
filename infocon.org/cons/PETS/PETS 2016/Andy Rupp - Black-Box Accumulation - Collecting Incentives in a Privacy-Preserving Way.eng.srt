1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,420
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for the introduction</font>

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:10,769
this is joint work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tebow Yaga well</font>

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,480
my talk is about a very common mechanism

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> user centric cyber physical systems</font>

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,189
which is called a point accumulation you

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,150
can also call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it incentive collection if</font>

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,660
you want here are three typical examples

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,848
where this mechanism is deployed so you

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,390
have loyalty systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carlton's in</font>

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,450
systems we we equal to crit and how does

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it work in a loyalty system you all know</font>

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,129
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT systems you get points for</font>

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,559
every purchase you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in as a in</font>

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,739
reward for your loyalty<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a shop or</font>

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,328
something like that it's basically you

16
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,419
basically have to say mechanism over

17
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,710
there there you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> incentives for</font>

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,260
sharing collected data that you measured

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,890
with your smartphone like how data or

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,408
like environmental data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,880
typically enhanced with location and

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,210
time and yeah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have this</font>

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,360
mechanism here you just replace

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">collected data here with the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Iker supplies to the smart quit so</font>

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,850
everywhere you have this basic principle

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,289
here and privacy is of call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of</font>

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">course an issue and all these scenarios</font>

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,720
so on all levels especially also with

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,869
respect to the quant accumulation

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,929
mechanism why because for example in

32
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,799
this scenario an operator if you do it

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,100
easily an operator could learn where and

34
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,630
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchase items or here it could</font>

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,070
learn where and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have pin when</font>

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,949
you collect the data with your

37
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,679
smartphone while<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking around so</font>

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,659
what's the set of the art in

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy-preserving point accumulation</font>

40
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,000
well there's there's not much at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,598
that I'm aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is no</font>

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,330
dedicated formalization of this white

43
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,209
sweat building<font color="#CCCCCC"> clock which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

44
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,550
unfortunate

45
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,220
it just appears implicitly as part of

46
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,340
some some<font color="#CCCCCC"> big assistance like we 2 g's</font>

47
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,310
systems or<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd sensing systems so</font>

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,160
what's the situation here well it's not

49
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,530
much better many of the systems actually

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">use crypto but they like formality so</font>

51
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,090
there are no models there are no proofs

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,610
so what that means it means that

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,820
actually most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you you cannot</font>

54
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,640
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure doll which attacks a system you</font>

55
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,120
consider should actually protect from

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,458
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is hope that it</font>

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,930
satisfies some vaguely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different notion</font>

58
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:58,950
of security so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better of</font>

59
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:02,040
course so we formalized the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum of</font>

60
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,220
functionality of such a mechanism we did

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,000
a privacy model a security model we came

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,970
up with a generic construction<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,320
abstract cryptographic building blocks

64
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:17,880
which of course satisfies our our

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:24,150
security formalization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we also</font>

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:27,810
presented in efficient instantiation so

67
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,170
probably some more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our framework</font>

68
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,420
so to keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple we try to formalize</font>

69
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:39,480
a token based<font color="#CCCCCC"> on line a non-interactive</font>

70
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,010
system what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so token</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Baines</font>

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,010
based means there is some cryptographic

72
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,840
object which roughly represents kind of

73
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,660
a piggy bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with which users can</font>

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,269
accumulate points then you have a bunch

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of non-interactive algorithms which can</font>

76
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:59,040
create modify or verify these tokens and

77
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,070
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> online means that so in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font>

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,450
the actual system later on you have to

79
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,600
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's some central</font>

80
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,040
database which contains the<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,920
reading tokens for double spending

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,679
purposes so what other<font color="#E5E5E5"> part parties of</font>

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,630
our system we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some traffic trusted</font>

84
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,790
third party which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually needed</font>

85
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,728
only once to set up some system

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,700
parameters honestly then we have users

87
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:26,430
users which like to collect points with

88
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,800
issuers who issue these these tokens

89
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,500
this piggyback

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,240
then we have an accumulator and she adds

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,469
points to our children<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a</font>

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:41,520
rare fire which which verifies and

93
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:45,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">freedoms the points so some more details</font>

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,049
about our system so as I said the

95
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:51,419
charterparty set up some some consistent

96
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,599
parameter so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera fluent string</font>

97
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,669
then we have the issuer who generates a

98
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,819
public and secret key where the secret p

99
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:03,150
is shared between the issue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also the</font>

100
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:09,120
accumulator how does the system work

101
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:11,370
well to issue a Chokin the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issuer once</font>

102
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,889
some some algorithm issue with the

103
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,039
secret key and a serial number<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

104
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:19,949
token the user checks the token to

105
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,878
accumulate the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> first plants that</font>

106
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,560
this token where this operation yields

107
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:30,770
besides the planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nun playing</font>

108

110
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:42,419
its secret key and the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> VI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

111
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:45,330
it wants to add when the user receives

112
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:48,060
the updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> houghton its unplanted token</font>

113
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:52,139
using the I'm planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> trapdoor updates</font>

114
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,990
as its balance and to redeem a token

115
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,969
again the user has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prepare a new</font>

116
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,759
token a verification token which in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

117
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,650
cases is again some sample and it kind

118
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,389
of token then it sends over the

119
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,508
verification token also the claimed

120
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:10,349
serial number and balance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:15,689
verifier checks everything so how do we

122
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:18,089
define privacy in our setting well first

123
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,250
of all what do we like to achieve so

124
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,770
roughly speaking we like to have unlink

125
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,830
ability of user transactions with whist

126
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,139
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a colluding issuer accumulator</font>

127
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,210
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> verify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we still assume that</font>

128
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,870
these guys sent valid tokens alibis<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

129
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,560
would be probably hard to achieve such a

130
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,750
security notion how do we define that we

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,020
use the wheel

132
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">ali</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world paradigm so that means we</font>

133
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,690
demand that there is an ideal world

134
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,760
which is indistinguishable for the

135
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,870
atrocity for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rosary from the real</font>

137
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,260
no information leaked well which helps

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:04,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rosary due to a link to interactions</font>

139
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,890
except for the total amount on the token

140
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,219
when the user would insert open but that

141
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,960
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done intentionally so what does</font>

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:43,210
said the issuer the accumulated<font color="#CCCCCC"> nevera</font>

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">fire collude to link transactions right</font>

151
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,940
so and in theory it's possible to a to

152
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">length transaction for example continue</font>

153
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,040
consider this link here why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,680
possible because this planet token is is

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,300
of course associated with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> token</font>

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,370
the user we<font color="#CCCCCC"> seized from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue</font>

157
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,550
because it's derived from it using this

158
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,560
plant operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so what we do do we</font>

159
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in reply in the in the ideal world</font>

160
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,870
well we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> demand that there is some</font>

161
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:17,180
simulation setup which generates besides

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,330
come reference wing also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simulation</font>

164
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,570
like a real TRS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the simulation</font>

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,049
generate applying the token and a

168
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,000
verification token right so now of

169
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,880
course there is no link at all between

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,440
this guy here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy here because</font>

171
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,439
we just deleted at all

172
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,900
ok this is this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security game</font>

173
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,420
it's also pretty simple the adversity

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can ask for new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> children's</font>

175
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,099
repeatedly it can can also ask the

176
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:03,560
accumulator to add points to to his

177
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,780
tokens repeatedly where this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

178
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,859
allegedly applying it<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about it</font>

179
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,050
can also be something completely

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,200
different in the end it should come up

181
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,689
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some verification talking some</font>

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:20,360
claim serial numbers and imbalances and

183
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:24,010
it wins if tokens verify and if the it

184
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:31,070
was we successfully claims more than

185
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:35,810
what was actually issued<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok some more</font>

186
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:37,940
words about our construction well we

187
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,800
used some standard cryptographic

188
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,930
building blocks like commitments

189
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,240
signature schemes and non-interactive

190
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero knowledge poof of proof of</font>

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,490
knowledge so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't formally define</font>

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,550
this building blocks here but just a few

193
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">words so will the commitment scheme you</font>

194
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,310
can commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value such this that is</font>

195
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,980
where you sitting but you can can also

196
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,959
not later change to value when you open

197
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,360
the commitment then we need that that is

198
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,250
commitments are we randomized able we

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,070
ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet that these commitments are</font>

200
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,800
additively homomorphic this means if you

201
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,920
have commitments to<font color="#E5E5E5"> too well use than</font>

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,930
the you can somehow combine these two

203
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,510
commitments like for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example multiplying</font>

204
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:24,290
them and the result will be a commitment

205
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the sum of these author of the</font>

206
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:31,640
content well use we need regular digital

207
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,500
signatures and we need business parks so

208
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,380
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in this park well it's a</font>

209
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,780
complicated tool but basically you can

210
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,420
you can with this truly you convince

211
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:44,089
some someone that you know some secret

212
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,560
satisfying a certain relation like you

213
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:51,470
know the yellow of a public public group

214
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,060
element such that nothing else is

215
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,060
revealed about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret</font>

216
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:05,020
so how do use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in an hour setting well</font>

217
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:10,540
first of all the issue simply generates

218
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:13,870
a simple signature key pair then to

219
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,599
issue a Chilton we simply commit to the

220
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,150
single number we also commit to the to

221
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the initial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> balance which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and</font>

222
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,569
then the issuer's signs these two

223
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:30,010
commitments this is our token the user

224
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">wife Isis Alden so to accumulate at</font>

225
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:38,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">oulton the user needs to plant it right</font>

226
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,730
so what what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> he do he simply reran</font>

227
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,000
demises the two commitments and showed

228
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:47,230
that he does correctly that means he

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,800
shows that he knows some original

230
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,860
commitment c1 c2 for which he knows for

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">which he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a signature so he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows he</font>

232
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,270
shows that he knows some authenticated

233
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,569
talking and that these commitments e 1

234
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:04,660
prime and tivo c 2 prime adjust some we

235
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">randomize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ations of of these original</font>

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems so this is sent over and of</font>

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,070
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totem if the</font>

238
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,040
planet open as well found then the

239
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:21,760
accumulator actually again issues

240
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,890
another new token where she keeps the

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,840
commitment to deceive normally just

242
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:32,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">receive and to generate a commitment to</font>

243
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,750
the updated balance she<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the the</font>

244
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,740
homomorphic property of the commitments

245
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,020
key then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> she signs everything and</font>

246
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:45,100
that's it and the user just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

247
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,079
verify this talking but it doesn't need

248
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,730
to to unplanned it open because of its

249
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:53,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">online degree so so much about our</font>

250
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,360
construction some words about

251
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,900
performance so we instantiated our

252
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,790
generic instructions with an optimal

253
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:07,750
structure preserving a signature scheme

254
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,589
from Krypto 2011<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with GS commitments</font>

255
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,590
and proofs two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

256
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:18,790
right and for this concrete construction

257
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,769
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> some estimates for 128 bits</font>

258
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:28,230
acuity which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> while the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high-security</font>

261
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,540
for user and issuer accumulator every

262
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,250
wouldn't and this is the result well it

263
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">appears to be fairly efficient because</font>

265
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,980
below 500 milliseconds you can also see

that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the accumulation</font>

271
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,970
course you should be still below<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:32,640
efficiency of our instantiation by

280
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:35,170
replacing these closely GS proofs by

281
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,620
hash proof systems which is only

282
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:42,790
possible in certain situations when the

283
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,760
when the issuer and the and the verifier

284
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:49,449
are the same entity but you can also try

285
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to improve the applicability of our</font>

negative points represent that ratings

290
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,339
and for this you of course need to

291
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,560
incorporate a mechanism which costs the

292
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:13,449

just drop back ratings by showing all
