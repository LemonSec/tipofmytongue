1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:05,130
alright so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I'm standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,109
you and lunch so hopefully this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,849
on time what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present is a</font>

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,710
premier pro game theoretic analysis of

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,559
censorship resistance this is joint work

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,660
with my co-authors at who were at

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,660
Waterloo<font color="#E5E5E5"> John said how do you say knee</font>

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,070
and my supervisor at Waterloo Ian

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,880
Goldberg and Stephen Murdoch I think he

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">is in somewhere here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as you may</font>

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,119
recall from my earlier presentation we

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,980
had the sensor model which was sent

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,800
around at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of errors there's</font>

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,780
collateral damage was being considered a

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,730
lot and we thought okay well how does

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,320
collateral damage and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

17
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,449
leakage which is the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,700
the sensor wanted to block but got

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,530
through how does how do those if we

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,600
include that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does the situation</font>

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,399
change and we also wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what</font>

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,949
happens in terms of the sensors

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,300
behavioral dynamics like we always seem

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,519
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the sensor isms kind of</font>

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,218
static entity who wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something so</font>

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,770
we wanted to model that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,719
also wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> model or see what happens</font>

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,030
when there's an interim the interaction

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,950
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sensor and the censorship</font>

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,930
resistance system we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was</font>

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,010
this like arms race but what we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

32
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at here is an interaction between</font>

33
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,670
the usage of the sensitive resistance

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,429
system and the sensor and how to behave

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,900
so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these things can be</font>

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,970
modeled as a strategic game which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,150
give a very very very high level and

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,100
simplistic view of it there's there's

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,920
more details<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the paper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but in fact</font>

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,689
you I think there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more depth to</font>

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,540
this but the things you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get away</font>

42
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,210
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away is in order to understand</font>

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">words the presentation is that the two</font>

44
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,470
actors the sensor and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive</font>

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">resistant system are rational meaning</font>

46
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it what they try to do is so you</font>

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,250
have a set of preferences over certain

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,889
outcomes they prefer some things to

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,100
other things and the players are going

50
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,939
to seek to maximize their utility

51
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,350
utility that they get from these

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,408
outcomes so utility can be you know

53
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,239
money or fame or whatever that it is

54
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,530
valuable we just got to call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> utility</font>

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,260
and what they're not going to do is

56
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,880
arm the other actor if it also harms

57
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,090
themselves so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part where</font>

58
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,799
they're behaving as rational actors<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

59
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,959
the second thing is the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,050
equilibriums because we have this

61
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,910
interaction between the two parties we

62
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,819
want to see if the game that they're

63
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,739
playing ever stabilizes is there a

64
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,720
particular set of strategies for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

65
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,610
that if they play those strategies<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">is no better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that they can do no</font>

67
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,670
other steps that they can take so that's

68
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,018
considered a equilibrium point and this

69
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,010
is considering equilibrium point because

70
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:52,000
any one party cannot take a unilateral

71
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,190
deviation like do another strategy and

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,050
produce a higher utility for them if

73
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,670
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case then this was not what</font>

74
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,560
we were at was not the equilibrium<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

75
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,030
that other thing might be so that's the

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,470
other thing to take away that once you

77
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,480
find the equilibrium point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means that</font>

78
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,090
it's stable the game should there's no

79
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">other strategies that the players can do</font>

80
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,120
that will help them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so with that</font>

81
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,920
said let's model a censorship game we

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,180
focus because this a huge you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,309
we mentioned in the previous

84
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,900
presentation there's a huge broad area

85
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,239
of things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could look at the</font>

86
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,489
interactions with many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different parts</font>

87
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,560
what we did is we focus on the data

88
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel this is the channel which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,959
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used by the sensory Museum system</font>

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to transport the juicy content that this</font>

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,660
resistor wants to look at and so on this

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,900
channel there's some non circumvention

93
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,250
traffic is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just their</font>

94
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,549
the data channel might be you know

95
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:49,609
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a skype channel or it</font>

96
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:51,260
could be a you know email channel or

97
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:52,790
anything of that nature so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is stuff</font>

98
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,190
that's not censorship resistance related

99
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,700
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto that channel we're going to put</font>

100
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,459
the sensitive resistant traffic this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

101
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the common thing that is happening</font>

102
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:06,650
is I mean from toxic just seen is that

103
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,260
that's what we try to do we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

104
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,370
put this there<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

105
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,560
the sensor is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to block this</font>

106
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,680
channel because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loss of the nonce or</font>

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,750
convention traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so together this</font>

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,370
is the entire total traffic on the

109
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:24,380
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the sensor can do it's</font>

110
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,849
a simplistic sensor we're not looking at

111
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very complicated sensor that can do</font>

112
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,229
crazy

113
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">DPI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff like that we looked at a</font>

114
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,800
very simplistic sensor all they can do

115
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,960
is allow the channel to go through or

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,840
block it because we're assuming that our

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,120
since you resist system is so good that

118
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,590
the sensor is unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell monster</font>

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,699
convention traffic from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive</font>

120
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,820
resistance traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the censorship</font>

121
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,130
the yellow part the CDP it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fraction</font>

122
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,949
of the monster convention traffic it's

123
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,320
just how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic is being sent as a</font>

124
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,260
as a relation to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> monster convention</font>

125
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,050
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now in the paper we looked</font>

126
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,599
at increasingly more complex settings

127
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,570
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present the settings second</font>

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,940
setting are you should definitely read

129
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,770
the paper for the more complex part

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,719
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce an apparatus for the</font>

131
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,219
sensor as well to show what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens but</font>

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general results don't change there</font>

133
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,110
so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present this one so here</font>

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,810
the game is that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

135
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,700
this sensor and the circumvent or go to

136
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,080
play a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of rounds but neither of</font>

137
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,960
them know when the game is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

138
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and so that's what mean by the</font>

139
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,609
indefinite horizon<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and here what we</font>

140
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,830
find is the equilibrium strategy is that

141
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,970
the sensor should never violate this

142
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:41,880
particular fraction of traffic to send

143
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,039
as a village as it as a you know

144
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,630
proportion of the total non sir

145
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,580
dimension traffic and the sensor will

146
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,139
always play allow so as long as the

147
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,590
sensor commander doesn't violate this

148
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,180
threshold does channel will be open and

149
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,419
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that much since chippers in</font>

150
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,300
traffic out at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least the intuition</font>

151
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,250
behind this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given round</font>

152
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> circum venture always gains more</font>

153
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,700
utility are by<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given rounder</font>

154
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,990
you've sense of circumvent or things

155
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,289
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should deviate I should send</font>

156
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,139
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than this threshold but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I wait</font>

157
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,360
to the next round I get this amount that

158
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,389
I can get through now this fraction here

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,940
and that extra next round but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I</font>

160
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,349
don't know when the game ends<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's every</font>

161
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,110
single round it's always better for me

162
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:30,900
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more round</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in that way</font>

163
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,310
we find the sense circumvent or it's

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,770
never a good idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to deviate</font>

165
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,080
and then hence it's not a good idea for

166
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sensor to need to block and since</font>

167
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,789
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a equilibrium point</font>

168
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,720
both of them will play this strategy and

169
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,790
there's no deviation from here we also

170
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,220
looked at we also added a little part

171
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,410
about this is this equilibrium problems

172
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,350
still stable even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the blocking is not</font>

173
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,790
permanent so in the up here in the first

174
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,380
two both points what we've said is if

175
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,169
you ever deviate the sensor will block

176
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,909
this data channel forever in this other

177
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,680
part where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not permanent it's like</font>

178
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,360
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensor will block you for a</font>

179
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,690
duration of time as punishment even

180
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,070
there the equilibrium<font color="#E5E5E5"> still plays out</font>

181
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,080
what this means is there's no point

182
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,070
deviating even even if the blocking is

183
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,570
not permanent the sensor type which just

184
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,940
means what are their preferences you

185
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,040
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> F this fraction whatever it</font>

186
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,380
happens to be it only affects the

187
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,590
fraction of CTP not the existence of the

188
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,560
equilibrium point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right so this</font>

189
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,450
was a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know on</font>

190
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Pete on paper kind of thing it's like do

191
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,370
these equilibrium points exist what are

192
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,020
they are and characterize them now we

193
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about okay let's let's try to</font>

194
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,430
move to the real world or as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

195
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,890
can from the simple model that we have

196
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,810
and let's look at the multiple channels

197
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,010
like let's try to apply this to multiple

198
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,930
channels we know what we can do with the

199
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,270
single channels so the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font>

200
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">automation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be that you know I</font>

201
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here have</font>

202
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,190
heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tour pluggable transports maybe</font>

203
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good so you know there's many</font>

204
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,419
pluggable transports ah there's also

205
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,880
systems like steak a torus anyone heard

206
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,099
of Stegosaurus it tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send traffic</font>

207
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,960
over multiple chatter multiple formats

208
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,530
okay so there is some precedent that

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,719
want to use multiple channels what we'd

210
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,359
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so the another motivation could</font>

211
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,250
be that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,979
traffic than just that fraction is

213
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,870
available on that one data channel we

214
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,909
add more channels and hence we get more

215
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,760
traffic out and also since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already</font>

216
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,950
have these protocols or transports

217
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,900
available how best to use them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

218
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,669
we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is it the case that</font>

219
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,620
we should use in one at a time or<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

220
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,260
them together<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what we'd like</font>

221
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at and what we found is that the</font>

222
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,900
equilibrium point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to treat each data</font>

223
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,529
channel or transport as individually

224
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,959
only send as much traffic as that

225
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,670
action we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just do that</font>

226
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,619
for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport however much</font>

227
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,349
non circulation traffic is there on that

228
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,730
channel just send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that proportion of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CTP</font>

229
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that the sensor will not block</font>

230
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,019
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not violating the</font>

231
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:07,790
thresholds now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

232
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:09,139
maybe you've distributed as much of the

233
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,809
CDP as you can but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still have</font>

234
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:13,970
surplus left over so the strategic thing

235
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:16,999
to do is just to dump it on the smallest

236
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,649
protocol that way you lose the least

237
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:20,629
amount of CTP because the sensor is

238
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:23,779
going to block that one so there he

239
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:27,529
blocks it right so that's cool that's

240
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:31,249
dumping now we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh what what if we</font>

241
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:33,829
just throttle the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's being</font>

242
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:35,809
produced by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the censorship resistance so</font>

243
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:37,219
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ignore the surplus traffic right</font>

244
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,019
so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model this as another</font>

245
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,540
protocol at the end that has no

246
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,519
circumvention non circumvention traffic

247
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,860
on it it costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sensor nothing to</font>

248
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,569
block it it's just modeling it I mean we

249
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,249
could have many<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways which we</font>

250
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,498
could do like just ignore it at the

251
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:53,509
client or tell clients don't send more

252
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:56,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">than this much traffic that's just how</font>

253
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it might be realized so at least hear</font>

254
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,359
you avoid losing the smallest protocol

255
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,490
and then hence you end up with higher

256
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
circumventing utility and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense for</font>

257
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great so this all sounds</font>

258
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,378
great but there's a problem if you're

259
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,589
dumping or throttling mechanism can be

260
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:14,269
gained it's susceptible to an attack

261
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fluently in susceptible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

262
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,579
dumping is similarly susceptible so this

263
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,800
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flooding attack what happens is</font>

264
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:24,589
ah shoot you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only supposed to see the</font>

265
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">first yellow thing here that's the</font>

266
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,100
channel you have I'm only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

267
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,720
at the circumvention traffic now or

268
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,209
ignoring the monster prevention traffic

269
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,569
the adversary their sensor starts

270
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,459
pumping I starts using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CRS and</font>

271
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,599
start sending fake traffic right they

272
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,670
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care if it gets through or not</font>

273
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,959
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> junk right so they start</font>

274
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,809
sending it so that red stuff is just a

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,059
fake traffic right so together<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CDP</font>

276
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,589
has now become this the system thinks oh

277
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:53,089
no I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of this much</font>

278
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:55,309
surplus but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

279
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,379
indiscriminate which of these because

280
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sensitive resin system can tell just</font>

281
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:01,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the sensor can tell you non circle</font>

00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:03,069

00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,690
resist system can't tell from real

00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:07,300
circumvention traffic

285
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,280
like the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor sending so it's</font>

286
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,689
indiscriminately going to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do</font>

287

it so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> both proportions get</font>

288
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,360
decreased and what happens is though on

289
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the channel you end up with some amount</font>

290
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,350
of fake traffic and real traffic but

291
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,589
it's less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going out before</font>

292
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the throttle or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped Burkle is</font>

293
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting the evicted traffic so in this</font>

294
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,430
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense we can evict real</font>

295
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,520
sensitive resistance traffic off of

296
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,380
protocols are actually functioning or

297
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,900
carrying traffic onto either being

298
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,000
throttled or dumped and for the sensor

299
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,870
doesn't cost anything extra like if the

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,910
cost of attack is 0 for the sensor then

301
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">he can drive this down to set there</font>

302
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,569
being no sense your resistance or almost

303
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,870
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive reason since traffic on the</font>

304
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,180
channel Wow<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bad</font>

305
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,250
so yeah this is the this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

306
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,439
blocked or throttle or what have you so

307
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:04,120
there's an alternative it looks very

308
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to the picture I had here you'll</font>

309
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,670
note that it's monotonically decreasing

310
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:12,400
right so what we do is we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

311
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,160
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but anytime we need to send</font>

312
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,610
any surplus we will never allow more

313
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,980
than any small protocol or small non

314
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,750
protocol with the less monster

315
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,510
convention traffic on it to carry more

316
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">CTP on it we will shift it in this</font>

317
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">direction so the thing that the sensor</font>

318
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,630
was leveraging before was the fact that

319
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will never move off of this small</font>

320
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,810
protocol you'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep dumping the</font>

321
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,490
surplus there so there's no extra cost

322
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,579
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of that we're saying</font>

323
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:43,240
no we will it's anyone's like it will

324
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,910
actually start sending too much traffic

325
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,880
over larger protocols and hence at least

326
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,350
drive up the cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack so the</font>

327
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,570
surface traffic gets spread over every

328
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,190
potential protocol and it drives up the

329
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,500
cost I just said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we looked</font>

330
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,140
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effectiveness meaning the</font>

331
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,410
sensor what the gain is they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

332
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,120
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending traffic the losses they</font>

333
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,650
take from the collateral damage of

334
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,630
having to block or protocol with non

335
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,790
circulation traffic on it with the gain

336
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:14,830
of how much they were able to evict onto

337
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:17,649
this onto this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in this</font>

338
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,839
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when the cost of</font>

339
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:22,209
is 0 for the center it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still</font>

340
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,850
self-limiting in the paper we discussed

341
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:26,529
like what are the feature or the

342
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,300
variables in terms of how quickly things

343
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,399
can get limited it has to do with the

344
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,719
ratio between the protocols and how much

345
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">non circulation traffic is there but at</font>

346
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end what we find is that it's always</font>

347
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:42,939
better than throttling<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the presence</font>

348
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:45,459
of this kind of attack so yeah so that's

349
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:47,800
what I wanted to say there of course

350
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is mean this is the best right this</font>

351
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an alternative that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is better than</font>

352
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,740
throttling or dumping and if you can't

353
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:55,240
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your dumping throwing mechanism</font>

354
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,499
from being gamed then obviously they

355
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,499
would be better because you'd get more

356
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:01,209
traffic out right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so limitations</font>

357
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,519
and future work like I said this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

358
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:06,128
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple sensor model like you can</font>

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,139
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at traffic and block it or</font>

360
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,839
allow it it can differentiate and stuff

361
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,639
like that another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

362
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,860
require perfect information both parties

363
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">must know exactly what your preferences</font>

364
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:23,170
are and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you gain and lose and</font>

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,389
all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's that also this</font>

366
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,459
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of apply the</font>

367
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,439
second one website you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to probe the</font>

368
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:31,089
sensor type like you want to know who is

369
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:33,779
it that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with you want to</font>

370
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,829
know what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of F should be and</font>

371
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,499
there might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ways where you can probe</font>

372
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,910
this to infer like first you just try

373
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:41,410
just send some traffic see what happens

374
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,199
if he doesn't block it maybe there's

375
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,779
more room you send more traffic but this

376
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,120
is a kind of difficult because the

377
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,800
sensor could<font color="#E5E5E5"> start gaming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your probing</font>

378
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,529
and be like oh he's probing right now I

379
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,089
should really have you know tell them

380
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I have much less tolerance for what</font>

381
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,189
I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do so this</font>

382
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of an open problem still so key</font>

383
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:03,610
takeaways so we provided a game

384
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,519
theoretic analysis of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

385
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,399
censorship game we looked at various

386
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,779
traffic allocation strategies for single

387
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,019
and multi-channel networks especially

388
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:16,509
and as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as provide some flood attack</font>

389
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:19,230
mitigation all right great<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was</font>

390
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:19,230
it thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>
