overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> beacons so that everyone is</font>

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,349
beacons are small low-power low-cost

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,619
transmitters that continuously send a

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,750
low-energy beacon signal a Bluetooth

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,420
signal excuse me so unlike traditional

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">bluetooth or the Bluetooth below four</font>

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,320
there's no syncing there's no pairing

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,509
required this sensor sip simply sends

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,399
out a signal continuously and any device

33
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,500
that comes within range can pick up that

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,869
signal and trigger some sort of action

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,689
or notification so in action these

36
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,840
beacons act as proximity excuse me

37
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,779
proximity sensors so<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine you're in a</font>

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,570
supermarket or a shopping mall and you

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,890
walk by a section of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the store and</font>

40
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,898
instantly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a notification for a</font>

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,520
product that you just walked by and you

42
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,159
just received a coupon for that product

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,119
so this interaction is using these

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,130
beacons however you do have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an</font>

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,390
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your device that can</font>

46
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,310
appropriately handle that signal

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,600
otherwise nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen and</font>

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,590
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth does have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font>

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,960
so as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the kind of information</font>

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,250
that you get from these encounters the

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,530
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beacon is what is being</font>

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,000
transmitted and that's stored somewhere

53
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,890
in the cloud so that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,750
application on the device this

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,540
covers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal then it will check</font>

56
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,480
the cloud in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine who owns</font>

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,970
the beacon what kind of items might be

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,970
nearby it or associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it as well</font>

59
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,680
as the proximity of the user so the kind

60
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,450
of pieces of information that mark and

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,459
encounter include the time you were

62
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,920
there the duration<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frequency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

63
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,140
visits even the travel<font color="#CCCCCC"> path the specific</font>

64
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,500
back path you took within a space that's

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,570
equipped with beacons so a lot of this

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,130
provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wealth of information to</font>

67
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,750
bacon providers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> retailer's</font>

68
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,269
especially from an analytics perspective

69
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,459
you can also know precisely where

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:55,350
someone is indoors but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

71
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,630
users due to the seamlessness of the

72
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,269
technology aren't even aware of how it's

73
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,190
working when it's being used and what

74
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,790
information about themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> as being</font>

75
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,070
shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I argue that there needs</font>

76
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,750
to be some sort of middle ground not

77
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,430
everyone would be comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

78
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,890
sharing their location every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

79
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're shopping and yet some might be</font>

80
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,480
depending on where they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> what items</font>

81
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,730
are nearby and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the issue</font>

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,310
there's no real context for people to

83
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,820
make a proper decision when they

84
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,410
encounter these Bluetooth beacons and we

85
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,720
do know from research that contextual

86
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,609
integrity is important to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy of</font>

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,310
perceptions associated with technology

88
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,350
so in other words context matters if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

89
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to decide when and where and with</font>

90
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,140
whom I'm going to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> some information</font>

91
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,790
so one one possible solution is to have

92
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,399
the beacon providers or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> retailers</font>

93
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,100
come up with labels some way to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,150
beacon a is associated with shoes you

95
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be is associated with t-shirts etc</font>

96
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then maybe also indicates this is a</font>

97
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,850
sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> vegan a lot of people may not</font>

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,280
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information with this</font>

99
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,890
because it's sensitive but the issue

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this is that first of all it's hard</font>

101
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,149
to expect all the beacon providers or

102
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,769
all the retailers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to abide by some</font>

103
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,790
standard where they provide these

104
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,380
categorizations and secondly the notion

105
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,238
of privacy that these beacon providers

106
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,029
would have would likely differ from

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,988
ordinary users naturally they're going

108
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,239
to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect as much information</font>

109
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,630
as possible so they would be less

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,620
inclined<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be or to consider any be</font>

111
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,930
sensitive as an ordinary user might so

112
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,760
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> I posit that we turn to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

113
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,090
users themselves in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to determine</font>

114
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,670
what is sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what am I when and</font>

115
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,950
where am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I willing to share and so in</font>

116
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,600
doing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I posit that crowdsourcing can</font>

117
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,610
leverage users to contribute beacon

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,820
labels and therefore allow them to make

119
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,810
informed privacy decisions a

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,390
crowdsourcing can just be defined as

121
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,100
ordinary people coming together and

122
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,900
collaborating to contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a body of</font>

123
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">knowledge to a body</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of knowledge or</font>

124
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,599
perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solve a problem typical</font>

125
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,580
examples include Amazon Mechanical Turk

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for many of you have experienced</font>

127
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a familiar of that Wikipedia is</font>

128
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,349
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> website where again a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

129
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">come together and contribute information</font>

130
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,320
similarly any crowdfunding sites that

131
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,270
you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of GoFundMe</font>

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,270
Kickstarter these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all examples of</font>

133
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,219
crowdsourcing so I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

134
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,990
crowdsourcing we can allow users to come

135
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,310
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these privacy labels so that</font>

136
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,770
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have discovered beacons</font>

137
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,090
before can now help inform other users

138
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,270
who are encountering them for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

139
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,270
time

140
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,379
so I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a user study in which</font>

141
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,810
I wanted to demonstrate a crowdsourcing

142
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,379
based approach to introducing context to

143
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,300
beacon encounters my hypothesis here was

144
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,979
that crowdsourcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an accurate and</font>

145
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,569
efficient approach to providing users

146
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,750
with context during these weekend

147
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:57,770
encounters so for this study<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recruited</font>

148
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,879
90 participants from my college campus<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

149
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,639
structured<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a between-subjects</font>

150
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,909
design and marketed the application as a

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,409
scavenger hunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I had people</font>

152
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,990
within the three-week span use my

153
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,909
application in a game sort of format to

154
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,099
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> around our bookstore and to label</font>

155
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:17,009
nine of these beacons with a category

156
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:18,270
label and a privacy label the reward for

157
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,639
participating was a five dollar

158
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,049
starbucks gift card and the measures

159
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,599
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was interested in studying</font>

160
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,969
include the label accuracy the label

161
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,620
time and the actual location sharing

162
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:31,449
that they indicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd be willing to</font>

163
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,069
do or not do

164
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,379
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a brief map of our</font>

165
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:39,529
bookstore our floor plan along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

166
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:41,360
locations of the beacons so I chose ones

167
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:44,599
that I felt would be varied as far as

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,169
the type of category and privacy that

169
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,330
users would have so I have the ATM as my

170
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,729
ground truth or my benchmark for what a

171
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,279
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> beacon would be considering most</font>

172
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,620
people probably not care to share every

173
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">time they went to an ATM and on the</font>

174
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,370
opposite end of the spectrum the

175
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,770
starbucks beacon I considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

176
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,229
benchmark for a the least sensitive or

177
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,789
for a public beacon and so with those

178
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,818
two benchmarks I can now compare the

179
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,409
remaining beacons<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how sensitive</font>

180
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:17,210
they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been according to the</font>

181
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:18,740
users in the study so this these are

182
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,520
screenshots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application that I</font>

183
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,680
built using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android this user would I</font>

184
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,799
use this application in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to enter</font>

185
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,240
the main menu<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start a session and</font>

186
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,680
upon doing so you see in the middle

187
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,990
screen that they would receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of</font>

189
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,969
proximity I'm sorted by distance so

190
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,009
selecting any what any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

191
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:43,250
beacons allows you to do two things you

192
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,710
can either locate the beacon in a find

193
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,120
me mode that<font color="#E5E5E5"> third screenshot is a radar</font>

194
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,180
that users would see if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed help</font>

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,909
locating a beacon or if they've spotted

196
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,319
it then they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> label the beacon so</font>

197
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:56,659
the far left screenshot they could

198
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,300
choose from a number of categories in

199
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:02,360
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that this beacon is this</font>

200
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,069
category once a category is selected

201
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,199
then in the middle screen you see a

202
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,719
privacy label form that they completed

203
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,639
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> users would indicate from low to high</font>

204
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,620
how sensitive a beacon might be

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,169
considered or in other<font color="#CCCCCC"> words how</font>

206
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,610
concerned might they be when it comes to

207
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,370
sharing their location at that specific

208
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,719
beacon and then also marking the social

209
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,060
circles that they would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

210
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:26,240
share with which included their friends

211
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,889
Barnes & Noble our campus bookstore the

212
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
university as a whole or the general

213
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">public lastly once they had done this</font>

214
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,519
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all nine beacons they would be</font>

215
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,559
presented with their final<font color="#E5E5E5"> score again</font>

216
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,110
because this was a scavenger hunt game

217
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,880
they received points based on the number

218
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,829
of beacons that in labeled how accurate

219
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,789
those labels were and the amount of time

220
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">it took them to do so</font>

221
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,240
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

222
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,850
between-subjects design so I had three

223
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,709
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups that I was looking at I</font>

224
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,620
described them as Top Cat crowd cat and

225
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:59,510
no cat so earlier I mentioned that a

226
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,850
plausible solution to providing these

227
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,470
labels would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to have the beacon</font>

228
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,660
providers or the retailer to generate

229
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,480
these labels so the top cat group

230
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,610
represents that hypothesis that you

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,529
could provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specific label for</font>

232
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,470
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they would select that in</font>

233
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,320
labeling these beacons the middle the

234
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,139
crowd cat represents the crowd the users

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,079
who solve recommendations for categories

236
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:26,720
based on other users inside of that

237
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,510
group I don't know if you can see but

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,510
those three that are under most popular

239
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,490
you'll see that Barnes & Noble women's

240
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,130
apparel had one user who marked that as

241
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,529
a category label under that polo ralph

242
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,779
lauren had 10 users and then under that

243
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">men's apparel one user so you can see</font>

244
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,880
based on the responses from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of</font>

245
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,579
the users in that crowd group what the

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,589
most likely category would be and then

247
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:54,380
my control group no cat did not receive

248
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,120
any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of recommendation so again my</font>

249
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,089
goal was to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the crowd could be</font>

250
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,860
relied on to accurately and efficiently

251
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,740
generate these labels for beacons within

252
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,010
his face so in order to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

253
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,050
analysis I<font color="#CCCCCC"> performed a one-way anova</font>

254
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,569
between the three groups and their

255
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,160
respective accuracies you can see the

256
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,980
top cat group had an accuracy of

257
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:22,060
ninety-four percent while the crowd cat

258
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,060
had an accuracy of 92.5 and no cat 86.6

259
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,240
so the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ANOVA test and the</font>

260
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,339
square on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right you see that we did</font>

261
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,010
receive we did have a p-value of point

262
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,269
zero one which allowed us to confirm

263
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,160
that there is a significant difference

264
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,290
in the accuracy between these three

265
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,110
groups in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find where that</font>

266
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,389
difference lies we did I did a postdoc

267
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,339
comparison and found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for crowd and</font>

268
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:48,410
no cat there was a significant

269
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,839
difference in accuracy as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

270
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">cat and no cat but there is not a</font>

271
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,000
significant difference between top cat

272
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,859
and crowd cat so in other words we can

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,410
say safely say that the crowd

274
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,870
and reliably contribute labels that are

275
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,339
as accurate or comparable in accuracy

276
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,290
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top cat group and obviously</font>

277
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,290
performing better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the no cat group</font>

278
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,430
performing a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar tests on the</font>

279
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">labeled time or the amount of time it</font>

280
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">took users to provide these labels I</font>

281
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,010
first transformed the time since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

282
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,480
it's not a bound normal variable so

283
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,490
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a logarithmic transformation</font>

284
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,410
I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a one-way anova</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

285
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,660
again found a p-value less than point

286
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero one confirming that there is a</font>

288
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,630

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,370
similar here both the crowd and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

good that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the result we wanted we want</font>

296
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,030
to be able to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crowd can do</font>

297
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,860
this just as efficiently as the group

298
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:58,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is given the correct label right</font>

299
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,390
away and lastly I wanted to look at the

300
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,089
location sharing responses that users

301
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,560
provided through the privacy labels so

302
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,420
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an aggregate view of those</font>

303
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,849
if I can draw your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to a</font>

304
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,130
sensitivity column that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just taking</font>

305
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the low to high that users marked for</font>

306
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,540
sensitivity of beacon and translating

307
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,430
that to zero to 100 and then the

308
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,290
remaining columns marked will share with

309
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,089
those I'll represent the percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

310
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,550
participants who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

311
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">their location at that specific beacon</font>

312
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,800
for that given social circle and so

313
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,900
again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first row ATM that was our</font>

314
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,390
benchmark for the least sensitive beacon

315
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:37,590
and starbucks at the very bottom was our

316
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,600
benchmark for the excuse me since ATM

317
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,830
was the most sensitive and starbucks was

318
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,320
the least sensitive as far as our

319
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:46,770
beacons and then comparing all the rest

320
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,620
i did a cochrane<font color="#CCCCCC"> sku test in order to</font>

321
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,949
compare the matched responses that is

322
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,410
compared the willingness<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with a</font>

323
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:01,730
certain beacon for all nine beacons and

324
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:04,740
upon doing so did post hoc comparisons

325
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,450
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> four within each social circle</font>

326
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,000
so within friends with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> bookstore with</font>

327
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and within public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

328
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,890
post hoc comparisons to see that the

329
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,719
restrooms beacon for example were they

330
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,510
more likely to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with at the</font>

331
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,890
restrooms than ATM if there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

332
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,319
significant difference then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would mark</font>

333
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,680
it accordingly at the table so there's a

334
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,330
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

335
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,719
summarize this is all just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

336
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:31,839
it does depend on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beacon is and</font>

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,670
who is has access that information that

338
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,640
participants are willing to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

339
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,699
location at that beacon so all this

340
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,140
combined the label time the accuracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

341
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,120
their willingness to share and the

342
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,370
differences between who and where they

343
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,820
share with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> help us confidently</font>

344
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,520
assert that crowdsourcing can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

345
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,120
a tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> to incorporate context when</font>

346
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,399
encountering these beacons and so to

347
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,250
conclude<font color="#E5E5E5"> I argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the rapid growth</font>

348
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,959
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> beacon applications demands proactive</font>

349
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,209
steps to handle location privacy issues

350
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,369
and my objective was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to empower users</font>

351
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,829
with a tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allowed them to manage</font>

352
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,390
their privacy in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage their</font>

353
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy they need to know what is the</font>

354
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,949
context in which their location would be

355
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,540
shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I confirmed that sharing</font>

356
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,690
location information during beacon

357
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,010
encounters does depend on context and I

358
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,320
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crowdsourcing based</font>

359
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,680
approach to incorporate context during

360
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,589
these encounters so my future work is to

361
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,120
integrate this crowd sourcing model into

362
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,500
a beacon privacy management framework

363
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,350
something that would allow users to

364
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,020
based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> received create</font>

365
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,480
privacy policies for any given beacon

366
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,100
where they could say based on what the

367
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,260
crowd<font color="#CCCCCC"> is saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to set a policy</font>

368
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,850
where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't share my location at this</font>

369
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,850
beacon but i will share it with this

370
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that made sense and I</font>

371
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,120
appreciate your attention I thank you I

372
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,120
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>
