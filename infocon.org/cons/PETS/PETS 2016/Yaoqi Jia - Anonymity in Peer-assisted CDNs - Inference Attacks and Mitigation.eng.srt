I'm guru good afternoon everyone I me

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,598
the web content delivery recently there

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">are many popular websites like Facebook</font>

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,610
and Google these websites receive

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,579
millions of his purdy across the world

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,160
they want a fast way to deliver web

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,219
content there are several options for

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,199
them to deliver web content to users

15
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,989
first they can set up their own servers

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,260
and hosts these web content on their

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,530

involve what clients to provide the

be licked where the browsing history we

classify inference attacks into two

categories and that is passive and

kinds of attacks is the active attacks

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,790
in this attack the victim made first
