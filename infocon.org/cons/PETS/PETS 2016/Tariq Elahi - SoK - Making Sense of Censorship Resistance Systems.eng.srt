1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty long paper it's</font>

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,770
25 pages and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,570
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't compress it into</font>

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,759
15-minute presentation so there will be

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,860
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are not discussed in</font>

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
the presentation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i recommend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font>

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,470
highly encourage you to actually read

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,140
the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is a NS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font>

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,029
sensitive resistant systems it's with my

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,490
co-authors shehrbano kotaku couldn't be

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,910
here unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some other</font>

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:34,589
quarters at<font color="#E5E5E5"> long Colleen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen BrewDog</font>

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,780
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> gulberg go over here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so just</font>

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,780
to motivate for the need for censorship

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,550
resistance system s<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we found is</font>

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,290
that there's a lot of sensitive

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,649
resistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and you will see some</font>

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,780
more being presented today and we were

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,440
wondering like are there like what is

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,969
their key you know functionality at that

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,519
that they provide what makes them

22
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,890
different and so we see that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,530
maybe it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case that they all</font>

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,600
provide the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> or provide for the same</font>

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,369
use cases they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,729
properties and that enables different

27
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,140
use cases there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a general sense</font>

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">which represent systems for instance</font>

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,750
tour with bridges and plural transports

30
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,610
and niche resistance systems that are

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,560
only useful for particular scenarios and

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,259
not useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know normal like web</font>

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,689
browsing so what we liked what we did is

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,960
we extracted some common censorship

35
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,939
resistance of censorship apparatus and

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">crs elements the properties and</font>

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,600
techniques and what we wanted to do was

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,369
see if we could provide some valuable

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,990
insights and I think that we have read

40
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,630
something like that which will provide

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,060
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end the aims of this talk is to</font>

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,770
again like I said it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very small</font>

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,210
subset of what's actually in the paper

44
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,439
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to highlight the</font>

45
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,850
abstract model that we use for the

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,520
censorship apparatus and the sierras

47
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,658
design the highlight the fact that it's

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,009
an arms race I'll show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by also</font>

49
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,719
presenting the common techniques that

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,149
have been deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been used by</font>

51
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,919
ciara systems and to shine some light on

52
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,540
open problems and challenges that we

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have identified so uh the first key</font>

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,970
thing that we note is that censorship

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,450
has some sort of scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> and scope most</font>

56
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,849
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on the fat</font>

57
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,099
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a part of the planet where</font>

58
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:20,230
the sensor does not exert any control

59
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,390
they are it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is outside the scope of</font>

60
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,760
influence of the sensor that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

61
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,399
little fist that you see there there's

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the scope of visibility it's the</font>

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,750
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the areas where the sensor can</font>

64
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,059
see and observe but cannot actually

65
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,489
exert any control examples of this is

66
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,709
where they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have caught cooperation</font>

67
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,840
with other countries that share data

68
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,760
with them but don't necessarily mean

69
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go and make that</font>

70
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,160
country do anything to its citizens<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

71
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,099
the size of these things is limited by

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,440
some constraints that the sensor has I

73
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:55,690
just mentioned some physical constraints

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,489
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know geographical where the</font>

75
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,230
sensor cannot you know actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

76
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,010
another sovereign nation and to anything

77
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,890
there to its<font color="#CCCCCC"> citizens there's political</font>

78
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:10,209
it may be the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> that since she is not</font>

79
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,450
such a flat herbal or appetizing notion

80
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,519
for the civilians<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that nation and</font>

81
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,440
also for relations between countries you

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,200
want to some countries may not like to

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">be presented as a censoring regime so</font>

84
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,069
that's some political constraints that

85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,109
may be in place there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> economic</font>

86
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,030
constraints on the one hand economic

87
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:31,780
constraints can be that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just too</font>

88
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive to conduct the level of</font>

89
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,430
censorship that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country would like</font>

90
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:40,000
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of the economic side is</font>

91
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,220
that by censoring it may hurt the

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,160
economy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country or have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

93
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,750
other economic impact that is the direct

94
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,819
effect of you know conducting that

95
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,590
censorship and finally the technological

96
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:52,600
which is usually what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on it</font>

97
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,150
says it possible to even do that level

98
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,980
of censorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so these are some of</font>

99
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the limitations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

100
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,660
sensor then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> those limitations what</font>

101
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,599
we did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we model the censorship</font>

102
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,269
apparatus as<font color="#E5E5E5"> an imperfect mechanism the</font>

103
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,880
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that there's some it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is inherent</font>

104
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mechanism some errors in the</font>

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">nature of false positives and false</font>

106
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,690
negatives false positives being a

107
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,760
blocking things that should not have

108
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,529
been blocked and false negatives letting

109
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,250
things go that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have actually been</font>

110
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:27,250
blocked the little curve on the side

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,110
shows us the tension<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the sensor</font>

112
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,610
and the circum venture that what the

113
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">sensor would like is to push the curve</font>

114
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,440
down to the bottom left corner I have no

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
false positives and no false negatives

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
and it's the aim of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CRS systems to</font>

117
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,520
try to push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the diagonal where the</font>

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,030
sensor is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically unable to</font>

119
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,430
protect or prevent these errors when it

120
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,739
tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do censorship the main tools</font>

121
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,360
for the censorship apparatus that<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

122
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,090
in RS<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we distill is that there's</font>

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,980
the fingerprinting type which is it

124
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,969
tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn as much as it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can about</font>

125
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,280
sensor sensitive resistance traffic and

126
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,500
activities and direct action what kind

127
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">of censorship actions it can take be at</font>

128
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:16,110
blocking corruption disruption things of

129
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:19,570
that nature so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to now move to</font>

130
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:27,730
the common Sierra's techniques and the

131
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:30,250
arms race<font color="#E5E5E5"> I present it as a distinct</font>

132
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,430
presented in<font color="#E5E5E5"> two from two directions one</font>

133
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,500
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address based things that the</font>

134
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,040
since we can do in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the address</font>

135
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">space or where things exist on the</font>

136
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,450
network the other one will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

137
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:48,100
can do on the traffic layer analysis of

138
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:50,169
traffic okay so initially in the address

139
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,630
space the first thing and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

140
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">present it as like not necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

141
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,979
this is how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arms race goes but this</font>

142
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:01,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one example of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how the arms race</font>

143
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:04,120
might can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented so the sensor</font>

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,030
starts blocking IP addresses of places

145
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are serving censorship or content</font>

146
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,299
that is not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensor</font>

147
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,490
would like their citizens to look at or

148
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,220
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> under in their regime to look</font>

149
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,380
at or it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start corrupting DNS or</font>

150
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,120
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it difficult to</font>

151
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,650
actually get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the website or service</font>

152
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is providing the sensitive</font>

153
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:30,070
resistance or sorry censor content so

154
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step a very simple one and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

155
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,110
low-hanging fruit is to deploy some sort

156
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,370
of proxy which is not yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocked by the</font>

157
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,250
censor because it has not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

158
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">identified as something that provides</font>

159
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,270
censored

160
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,400
so that's like usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first step</font>

161
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:50,020
and sometimes may be sufficient in many

162
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,568
regimes then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step could be that</font>

163
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,400
oh we've discovered that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's</font>

164
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:58,150
happening the sensor starts blocking the

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">axe the access points to this to the</font>

start<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding our IP addresses let's give</font>

169
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,180
them only to our friends let's start

170
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting mechanisms in place that makes</font>

171
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,740
it hard for the sensor to go out and

172
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,960
find these proxy addresses easily an

173
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">alternative to that is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have just no</font>

174
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,299
IP address for the sensor to actually

175
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,879
block here I'm I'll point out an example

176
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,159
systems like decoy routing systems they

177
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,319
have this property that there you don't

178
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:36,219
block based on IP addresses you have to

179
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:41,020
block the whole route a third one based

180
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:43,719
on addresses that you could do is to use

181
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,479
a popular service that the sensor would

182
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:49,210
be loath to block because it would have

183
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,758
too much fallout in terms of economics

184
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,969
in terms of political<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

185
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,419
constraints that it has so this is

186
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:00,580
systems like use Google Amazon and

187
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,589
things of that nature that are too<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

188
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,930
to attack or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the assumption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

189
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:06,940
they're too big to attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensors point of view the sensor could</font>

191
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,279
then you know deploy sophisticated

192
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,110
techniques to harvest the IP addresses

193
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:16,180
from when you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

194
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,639
them he could try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pro for those IP</font>

195
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,520
addresses by actively trying to detect

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,270
these services sewer systems operating

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,589
on those IP addresses for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

198
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,180
where there is no IP addresses you could

199
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,069
start avoiding the route what you've

200
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,169
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you've just taken the step of</font>

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fight to another level where you're</font>

202
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,880
like getting the adversary not to just

203
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,380
block by destination but by whole routes

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,328
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the final one it could</font>

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">be that you miss you did not assume</font>

206
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:47,290
correct lead that the sensor would not

207
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,130
block this popular service and they go

208
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,260
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and block it and finally on the</font>

209
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,100
side of where things haven't yet cotton

210
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,470
block completely

211
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,709
I to prevent the sensor from harvesting

212
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:03,880
too aggressively<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could try to rate</font>

213
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:07,869
limit how you give out your IP addresses

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,189
you could have it that the IP addresses

215
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,360
you use are only valid for a short

216
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,180
period of time so even if the sensor

217
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,870
collects them they're not worth that

218
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,069
much in the long term it different is

219
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,899
already pointed out there's five minutes

220
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:24,339
left so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to move on and just</font>

221
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,060
point out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had this thing for</font>

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,589
traffic patterns but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

223
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,540
arms race here if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper</font>

224
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read about the details of these</font>

225
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,290
various sensitive resistance techniques

that have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and the attacks of</font>

instant what I really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

228
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,979
was the juice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the open</font>

229
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,889
problems and trends<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the first</font>

230
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we questioned some common</font>

231
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,420
assumptions revisit them we wonder about

232
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,660
the attack realism so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showed that</font>

233
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was this escalating you know arms</font>

234
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,500
race some of it is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor is</font>

235
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,389
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this is in the literature</font>

236
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,370
showing that these are attacks that are

237
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,959
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mitigations</font>

238
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,660
for it so perhaps the sensor is not

239
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to attack these high costs are</font>

240
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,120
you know distinguishes that we have

241
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:12,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">identified so and also maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

242
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,380
focusing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> as academically challenging</font>

243
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,740
things versus what the sensor actually

244
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,670
is willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so what we need is some</font>

245
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,680
empiricism in terms of measuring our

246
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,240
sensors capabilities and also what

247
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,069
they're actually doing there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

248
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,139
studies but they're mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> snapshots in</font>

249
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:30,430
time and other particular geographical

250
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,269
regions what we'd like is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something more</font>

251
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:37,089
large-scale also one of the assumptions

252
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:39,160
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole scope is that maybe we</font>

253
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:41,410
have made a mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of making</font>

254
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,839
central systems with very specific scope

255
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,189
that we have an outside like things like

256
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,990
the snow revelations shows us that

257
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:49,750
perhaps the scope is much larger than we

258
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,600
thought and also this has implications

259
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,149
for our assumptions on these countries

260
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,069
will not clued and you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

261
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,050
oh if I put my central business through

262
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:03,300
many different jurisdictions they're not

263
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:06,099
going to pollute so this kind of gets a

264
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,579
suspect as well and finally we always

265
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,200
seem to think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensor is</font>

266
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,050
sort of static entity we don't

267
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,090
investigate the dynamic behavior that

268
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,469
might be in play we also don't look at

269
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,660
how the sensor behaves<font color="#CCCCCC"> an information</font>

270
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,670
leakage we always always consider like

271
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,650
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it behave to collateral damage</font>

272
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,170
like how what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference and put</font>

273
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,730
up there so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paper at the</font>

274
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,290
end if you stick around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

275
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:33,320
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things here I wanted to point out</font>

276
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that let's focus on collateral damage it</font>

277
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,270
always seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the more collateral</font>

278
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,980
damage you can get the better it is and

279
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,600
the way to get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great amounts of</font>

280
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,970
collateral damages perhaps to focus on

281
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,460
really really popular services and

282
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,170
platforms and the idea being is going to

283
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,540
be mutually assured destruction if the

284
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,699
sensor<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this yeah sure we lose our</font>

285
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,410
sense of resistance system but it really

286
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">really would hurt the sensor result as</font>

287
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,040
well as well and so this brinksmanship

288
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:04,010
is some kind of equilibrium<font color="#E5E5E5"> state also</font>

289
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,770

only provide the services that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

and finally it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sensor</font>

does not shut down these services they

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,680
just embrace and co-op them and have

design for there's infrastructure this

343
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,829
has happened many times where the

the CRS and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sierras functionality</font>

346

starts working and it could of course

<font color="#E5E5E5">cease operations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether finally</font>

there could be unexpected consequences

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,060
we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh if you concentrate</font>

all everything into one place put all

thing the sensor is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to attack</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what this could do is provide a</font>

356

concentration point for the sensor to

357
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,700
really focus in<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these particular</font>

359
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,410
for the sensor like if you starts for

360
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,510
instance start using google they know

361
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,620
exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will serve as a supposed</font>

362
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,140
to behave like and maybe they can

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,370
develop better fingerprints it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

already mentioned it can allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

allows targeted attacks and this

366

escalates<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arms raised in this</font>

367
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,560
particular niche and perhaps the returns

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,609
are diminishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

369
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,399
key takeaways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go in river so reduce</font>

370
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,260
dependence on popular services how we'd

371
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,690
like things to be more distributed

372
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,819
diverse and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicating structure</font>

373
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,070
that works for the CRS not because it's

374
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,579
a happy coincidence get ahead of that

375
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:19,380
arms race I briefly highlighted there we

376
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,300
like to have privacy in this yours

377
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">designs so that if you do have</font>

378
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,660
compromises you don't have it give up

379
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,670
the users of yours and of course we like

380
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,560
to have designs or explore designs where

381
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,339
the scope of influence and visibility is

382
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,780
much larger than we thought

383
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,780
it was thank you
