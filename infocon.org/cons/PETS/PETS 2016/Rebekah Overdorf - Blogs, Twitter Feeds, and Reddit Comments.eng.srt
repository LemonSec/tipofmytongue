through writing style analysis most of

7
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,770
this work however deals with identifying

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,590
the authors of an unknown document using

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,140
other documents of a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> type so for</font>

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">example you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a twitter feed and</font>

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,150
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the author of it</font>

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,369
and you have a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect set of some</font>

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,720
sort and for each of these authors you

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,519
have other<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter feeds that they've</font>

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,649
written unfortunately this isn't always

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,820
the case so again let's say we have a

17
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,320
twitter feed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to find</font>

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the author of and we have a suspect set</font>

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,500
but it's unlikely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

20
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,410
twitter feed for each of our suspects

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,850
and maybe instead we have a blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> entry</font>

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,870
or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email that some of them have</font>

23
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,120
written this this work looks at this

24
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,919
type of problem and how to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,980
in different solutions so let's lead

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,109
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an excerpt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">a popular blog called the secret diary</font>

28
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,580
of Steve Jobs it's very obviously not

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,548
written by steve jobs but at the time of

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">publication it was the author actual</font>

31
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,090
author was unknown and because of its

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,850
popularity a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people had compiled</font>

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,460
lists or had suggested that certain

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the author of this blog but</font>

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,729
for all of them there weren't other

37
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,490

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter feed this end up dan lines was</font>

40
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,100
published 12 tweets that are kind of

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:40,170
similar in sound to some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog</font>

42

entries from<font color="#CCCCCC"> steve jobs salama tree is</font>

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,009
based on this assumption that everyone's

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,149
writing style is unique so this may be

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,820
things like regional differences

46
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,799
spelling differences words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

47
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,630
similar meanings but are different or

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,880
different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> express the same idea</font>

49
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,380
for example one person may say the fork

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,259
is to the left of the plate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

data set is the blog and tweets where we

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,410
have a bunch of blogs that we've

<font color="#CCCCCC">in sentiment classification you have</font>

static classes so for here where this is

send<font color="#E5E5E5"> him a classification what we're</font>

doing is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to label the tweets for</font>

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,489
people are having positive or negative

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,780
reactions to pets for example and maybe

92
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,310
you don't have a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled tweets</font>

93
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,220
as positive or negative but you can like

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,440
make your way over to amazon and buy a

<font color="#E5E5E5">TSA simulator toy and look at the</font>

nicely with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to five star so you can</font>

see if they're positive or negative

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,170
reviews in sentiment classification you

100
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,209
might go back to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter feed and</font>

101
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,320
maybe label a couple of them manually or

102
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,760
something like this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have more</font>

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can use but then</font>

always<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for something is good bad</font>

or maybe even neutral but in general

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,060
it's the same siloam entry differs

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,980
though so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

109
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,049
twitter feed and instead we're trying to

110
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,440
link these twitter handles some of which

111
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:19,530
may be anonymous to let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

112
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,469
giving talks today this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a harder</font>

113
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,640
problem or at least a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different problem</font>

114
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,710
because the classes change because the

115
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">classes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are authors or users themselves</font>

116
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,430
and not just good better neutral and we

117
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,229
can't go labeling these tweets if we

118
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,110
don't know who wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and that's the</font>

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">goal but like any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other machine learning</font>

120
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,889
problem feature selection is an

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,479
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in this work we use a</font>

collection of features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover</font>

in domain so in demand in this talk will

case in both of the data sets that we

135
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:10,620
have you failed pretty miserably so what

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this or can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we first</font>

understand why this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem at all</font>

138
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,550
so to do that we're going to estimate

<font color="#E5E5E5">the difference between two domains d1</font>

for each author essentially here we're

143
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:28,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">just trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> determine how an author's</font>

144
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,000
writing style changes across two domains

145
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,810
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call this distortion</font>

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,190
and the larger the distortion the

147
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,659
farther apart the features are and

148
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,030
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the farther apart the writing</font>

149
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,770
styles are across domains so you can see

150
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,229
that within a domain the numbers are

151
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,198
fairly small and across domains the

152
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,820
numbers are huge so the features are

153
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,669
much more distorted across domains than

154
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,409
within domains also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not surprising we</font>

155
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,508
have better<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter results than we do</font>

156
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">reddit and WordPress results and the</font>

157
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:59,190
Twitter distortion numbers are smaller

158
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,590
than the reddit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress numbers so</font>

159
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,680
not surprising but interesting in the

160
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">west so we saw that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> features are more</font>

161
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,070
disordered across domains here but is

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,240
that true of all features or features

163
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,770
consistently maybe for example there's a

164
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,169
type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of feature that works really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

165
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,340
across domains functional words and

166
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">puerto speech tags have been heavily</font>

167
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,679
suggested for this so here we took

168
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,889
different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of features and we used</font>

169
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,990
only those for the classification for

170
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,840
example digits or characters or function

171
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,820
words and again blue is in domain and

172
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">red is a cross domain and we see that</font>

173
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,380
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really out performed using all</font>

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,400
well cross

177
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:46,560
as it does for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carter speech tags so</font>

178
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,239
features don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change consistently</font>

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,490
across style with any specific groups

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,070
and there's no sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> function there's</font>

181
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,360
no a collection of features or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feature</font>

182
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,540
type that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that would work well</font>

183
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,610
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this situation but let's go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

184
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,420
distortion and see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

185
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,850

specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> group of features a specific</font>

188
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would change across domain so here</font>

189
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,220
we took the least distorted features and

190
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,049
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept them and we took the most</font>

191
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,690
assorted features and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got rid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

192
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we did a dev test test at here so</font>

193
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,550
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make sure that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,109
over fitting our data at all what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

195
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,510
that removing features<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the most</font>

196
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,730
assorted features doesn't improve our

197
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:34,020
accuracy at all it even it decreases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

198
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,850
accuracy so while one author may change

199
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,409
in one way across domains another author

200
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,340
will change another way and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

201
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,780
to be no consistency and how they change

202
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,479
our first seven fixing this problem was

203
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,919
through mixed training here's a normal

204
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,840
problem set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a group of</font>

205
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,950
suspects and they're all bloggers and we

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,880
want to connect them to an unknown

207
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter account first thing we did was</font>

208
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,740
thrown through a whole bunch of other

209
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,690
tweets that are not relevant to the

210

other tweeter into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> year Twitter user</font>

211
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,910
into the suspect pool and this attempts

212
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,710
to train the classifier a little bit

213
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,060
about how tweets are and to highlight

214
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the features that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

Twitter and not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress and we have</font>

216
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,820
a small jump in accuracy here versus the

217
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,450
naive method which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the original one</font>

218
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,900

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">data sets but nothing fantastic so the</font>

220
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,609
results are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still pretty bad but how can</font>

221
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,469
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the problem if we look at this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">problem as account linking instead of</font>

223
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,940
just as an identification then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

224
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,310
little more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all we</font>

225
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,160
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more data and then we also get more</font>

226
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,869
information about both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domains</font>

227
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,150
let's look at this a different way if

228
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,940
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of just a</font>

229
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,439
reddit comment or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we instead</font>

230
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,090
look at it as a reddit account we

231
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,420
suddenly have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more data to work</font>

232
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,550
with

233
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,079
right inside so let's try to identify

234
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,880
the author of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unknown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter feed</font>

235
00:08:55,079 --> 00:09:02,120
of this unknown reddit account excuse me

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,120
from the suspect set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter accounts</font>

237
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,969
at first<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unknown document is class</font>

238
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,829
excuse me if<font color="#CCCCCC"> at first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the if the first</font>

239
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,500
unknown document is assigned to yellow

240
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:16,519
very strongly and the other ones are

241
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,620
signed to other colors but very weakly

242
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,120
averaging allows us to pick the yellow

243
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,310
class with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow Twitter account</font>

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,360
instead of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones even though it</font>

245
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,130
wouldn't win by straight voting

246
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,430
basically what we do is take the

247
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:34,070
probability values for each of them and

248
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:36,029
multiply them until so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> favors the</font>

249
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,500
favors the higher probabilities and

250
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,939
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> confidence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions over the</font>

252
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,660
see here and this method<font color="#E5E5E5"> also works</font>

253
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,920
excuse me this method also works

254
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,180
especially well when errors are

255
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,290
uncorrelated as you show through the

256
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">feature analysis in the beginning again</font>

257
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,290
we get a small jump in accuracy

258
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,890
especially in the reddit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

259

again report the accuracies what we get

from this is for every Twitter account

277
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,630
we get the probability<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was</font>

written by each reddit account and we

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,230

the distortion between the domains and

305

overcome that by adding more information
