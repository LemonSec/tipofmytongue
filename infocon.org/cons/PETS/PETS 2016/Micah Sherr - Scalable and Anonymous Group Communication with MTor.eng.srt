00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,508
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> great I'm still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Micah and I'm here</font>

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,850
to talk about anonymous group

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,160
communication this is joint work done

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,500
with dong Lin who recently completed his

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,919
PhD at<font color="#CCCCCC"> UPenn and his adviser and my</font>

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:25,380
thank Nikita for sending me<font color="#E5E5E5"> pokey mango</font>

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,880
tweets during my last talk I encourage

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,538
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to do that wherever you</font>

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,129
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the goal of this work is to</font>

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,720
support efficient group communication

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,640
while hiding participants network

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,260
locations it's slightly different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,300
the type of group anonymity that we've

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,640
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and as present in systems</font>

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,410
like um<font color="#E5E5E5"> dissent and verdict so in other</font>

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,390
words I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support anonymous file</font>

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,429
sharing and streaming for example or

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,660
anonymous audio and video conferencing

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,920
and so kind of a neutral reaction to

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,919
this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we already know how to do</font>

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,440
this it's used this system called<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor</font>

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,339
and how might you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in tour well</font>

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,499
these six users say they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

25
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,780
anonymous video conference and to

26
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:12,089
facilitate that they'll use google

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,439
hangouts so what they'll do is they'll

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,380
connect to the guards<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their middle</font>

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">and their exits and they'll form</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tour</font>

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,990
circuits to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Hangouts and this</font>

31
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:28,048
this in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> should work although it</font>

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,329
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> works well if and only if tours</font>

33
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">are really a drop-in replacement for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,149
and tour isn't a drop-in replacement for

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,749
TCP because of bandwidth constraints and

36
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,369
the network it's not essentially fast

37
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:42,990
enough to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this at large scale</font>

38
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,939
hopefully it will be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future but</font>

39
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,829
today not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much but in this work we</font>

40
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,779
looked at well can we still use tor

41
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,630
maybe with some modifications<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage</font>

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing user base and infrastructure to</font>

43
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,869
do group communication but in a way that

44
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,639
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done more efficiently and we</font>

45
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,609
started off by kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking at this</font>

46
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:08,669
very contrived picture and making some

47
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,670
observation and the first observation we

48
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,600
made is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same plain text the</font>

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,660
same video conferencing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and from</font>

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,910
if you will is being related multiple

51
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,730
multiple times potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the same</font>

52
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,450
same links so there's some perhaps

53
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:30,450
unnecessary that's arguable but perhaps

54
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:33,160
some unnecessary redundancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

55
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,160
the second observation we made is that

56
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this external facilitator is for the</font>

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">most part kind of a fairly simple IRC or</font>

58
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,150
echo server and I'm kind of skipping the

59
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,950
Google Hangouts thing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can add</font>

60
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,810
funny-looking hats in people's heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

61
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,630
for the most part it takes communication

62
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:55,750
from Alice and sends it to you know Bob

63
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:58,710
Charlie and Dave to kind of give you an

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview of what we've done in an mtor</font>

65
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,480
the first thing we did is we removed the

66
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,140
need for this external facilitator and

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll explain how that's that's a</font>

68
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:15,010
possible in a few minutes and we also

69
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,420
removed the use of exit relays now tour

70
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,829
still has exit relays we're still

71
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,709
supporting unicast we're not kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,160
changing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the 99.999% of the</font>

73
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,410
users who<font color="#E5E5E5"> still want to use tor unicast</font>

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,540
messaging words introducing a multicast

75
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:33,160
primitive for tour that could be used by

76
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,480
users who are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> inclined and in the</font>

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,660
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the when I'm calling the</font>

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,500
facilitator we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce multicast route</font>

79
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,470
which is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might guess going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,810
the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our multicast tree and</font>

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,650
finally and perhaps most controversially

82
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:53,830
we take the links<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have redundancy</font>

83
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,250
and we merge them together so that

84
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,140
redundant information is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent once</font>

85
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apparent in a few</font>

86
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:06,059
minutes why that could be controversial

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,460
so we're introducing multicast messaging

88
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,840
semantics to tour very kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of at a high</font>

89
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,060
level this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than</font>

90
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,070
sending to a particular IP you send to a

91
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,570
group identifier and people can join

92
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,820
that group and when you receive a

93
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,060
message you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subscribe to it this</font>

94
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pub sub system if you will it</font>

95
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,380
preserves bandwidth by removing message

96
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,980
duplication and it also offers sort of

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,690
round trip time

98
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">times because it eliminates this extra</font>

99
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,750
hop between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exit and the facilitator</font>

100
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,719
and then back so the shorter paths and

101
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,430
it also importantly reduces bird the

102
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">burden on exit relays which are already</font>

103
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,740
overtaxed by simply not using them so

104
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,180
the challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

105
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,560
to open Pandora's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Box we don't want to</font>

106
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,440
prevent flooding attacks which is

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,940
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous for multicast</font>

108
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,530
systems because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send one</font>

109
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">message and cause that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message to be</font>

110
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,059
propagated 10,000 times that's bad for

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,130
denial of service we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to kind of</font>

112
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,950
reinvent flow control because you don't

113
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,020
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP like or send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me like and flow</font>

114
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,360
control efficient turn handling and fast

115
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,299
recovery and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should probably</font>

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,630
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we don't kill anonymity in</font>

117
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,300
terms of security we have some notion of

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,560
authenticated messages for flow control

119
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,420
not really going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this in</font>

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,670
this talk but there's details in the

121
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,980
paper we do best effort routing and we

122
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,260
have we're introducing loss to tour you

123
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:30,340
can now deuce messages which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weird</font>

124
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,930
thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP but we manage it and for</font>

125
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,460
turn and handle turn handling and

126
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,470
recovery we use the combination of

127
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,840
heartbeat messages and very fast

128
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,700
multicast tree assembly algorithm and

129
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk about in a new MIDI that</font>

130
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,390
requires more space than I have here in

131
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,970
a little bit so how does what is the

132
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,500
design of mtor it begins with receiving

133
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">a group descriptor so if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to join</font>

134
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,710
a group I<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow get one of these</font>

135
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,479
descriptor documents this could be

136
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,090
posted on a blog you could fetch it over

137
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,770
unicast tour you just somehow get one of

138
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,859
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what this is is it's basically</font>

139
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,520
a description of the multicast group

140
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:12,070
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one per group in this document</font>

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,990
it describes some minimum bandwidth

142
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,290
that's required this is again because

143
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,630
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using multicast and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lost becomes a</font>

144
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,650
factor so want to remove bottlenecks so

145
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:27,700
we impose a minimum bandwidth and we use

146
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,650
a blinded key generation scheme that

147
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,320
methoden came up with a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

148
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,500
and i think the context i forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tor</font>

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,710
hidden services and briefly what this is

150
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,240
is you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> master key pair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a public</font>

151
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,359
and private key in

152
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,919
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then if you have the public</font>

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">master public key and not so you can</font>

154
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:52,740
generate a series of subordinate public

155
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,240
keys and correspondingly if you have the

156
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,949
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> key master secret key you can</font>

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate subordinate private keys such</font>

158
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,699
that the subordinate public keys and

159
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,120
subordinate private keys match and

160
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">importantly it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emits the link ability</font>

161
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,479
between sessions so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">either of those two masters you can't</font>

163
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,889
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these sessions are linked and</font>

164
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,169
this is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for preventing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> likability</font>

165
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:17,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you can do this using Dan</font>

166
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:20,109
Bernstein's signatures which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick proved</font>

167
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,740
to be correct implementation so thank

you confidentiality keys can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

provide optional end-to-end guarantees

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:32,440
this is multicast so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you</font>

171
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,419
can have a layer of encryption on top of

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just want to not if</font>

173
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,000
you want to make it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one</font>

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,780
messages in each epoch in each time

176
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,859
period each can we divide time in two

177
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,539
time periods each client is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use</font>

178
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,849
the master public key to generate a new

179
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,800
public session key and then compute a

180
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,539
group identifier which is a half of the

181
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,310
bandwidth the session length we're

182
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the subordinate</font>

183
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,530
public key in a high level picture here

184
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,750
is that the group identifier is used to

185
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,818
tie this public key with the particular

186
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">group and it essentially prevents</font>

187
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,969
forgery attacks are trying to substitute

188
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:19,169
in a different private key how is the

189
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,159
multicast route selected we use a

190
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,960
consistent hashing based mechanism

191
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,900
basically we take the relays their

192
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,909
fingerprints and stick them on a ring we

193
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,000
also throw into their position is based

194
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:34,059
on their their fingerprint the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gid and</font>

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,070
consensus and we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those things to</font>

196
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,529
basically prevent a trivial attack and

197
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,329
prevent an adversary from being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

198
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,409
game its position ahead of time on the

199
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:43,870
ring it doesn't know what the ring is

200
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,300
going to look like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multicast</font>

201
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,820
route is simply the first relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> past the</font>

202
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">gid in this consistent hashing space</font>

203
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,580
that is stable and fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has</font>

204
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,960
sufficient bandwidth

205
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to all the clients and kind of agree on</font>

206
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reboot strap towards existing</font>

207
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,670
consensus mechanism the tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> is formed</font>

208
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,839
by having client create circuits to its

209
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,699
normal garden so you use the normal

210
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,610
guard we're not changing how that works

211
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,650
a big difference is if the guard is

212
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,290
already in the multicast tree you stop

213
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,410
if not you extend the circuit to a

214
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,360
middle relay again using<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen using</font>

215
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,980
for the most part tours default relay

216
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,720
selection strategy except for the

217
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,810
bandwidth waiting except for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum</font>

218
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,490
bandwidth thing and it fits in the

219
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,439
multicast where you stop otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

220
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,320
extend finally to the multicast route

221
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,570
and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a very typical</font>

222
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,370
design for multicast messaging systems

223
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,100
messages are protected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 TLS because</font>

224
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,230
it store between relays but we don't use

225
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,480
layered encryption that means that you

226
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,040
can follow the adversary can if it has

227
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,560
sufficient view of the network follow

228
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,660
messages across tour and that's a

229
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,520
weakness of our system we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

230
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,930
particularly we have kind of an argument

231
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the paper why that's not necessarily</font>

232
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,219
a bad thing for multicast or may be

233
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,510
unavoidable in certain cases but if

234
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,440
you've got a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that that would</font>

235
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">be fantastic we don't use later an</font>

236
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,210
encryption because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do message</font>

237
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,189
deduplication if a message is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

238
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,350
be sent twice over this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular link</font>

239
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,820
we only want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more than once we</font>

240
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,970
only want to send it once because that

241
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,410
saves bandwidth and as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

242
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:25,140
provides a weaker security than<font color="#CCCCCC"> tours</font>

243
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:28,230
current design cells are signed and mtor

244
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:33,180
they're signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the subordinate</font>

245
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,800
secret key and the disseminate how'd the

246
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,620

247
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,109
disseminated allow allows a choice of

248
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,500
open groups where the secret key is kind

249
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,510
of public and anybody can get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

250
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,920
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a sender in the group or you can</font>

251
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,920
have essentially access control

252
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,959
mechanism based on or based on who has

253
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,209
knowledge of this secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> key and we call</font>

254
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,710
that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this paper closed groups in this</font>

255
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">provides some protection against</font>

256
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">flooding attacks because things have to</font>

257
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,420
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly signed</font>

258
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,920
so in terms of the performance how low

259
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,150
does this work we implemented a bunch of

260
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,979
dumb ified versions these are

261
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,990
applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have traffic profiles</font>

262
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,600
similar to what the real versions would

263
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,460
have of a single source streaming

264
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,070
application so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm sending to a</font>

265
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,780
group of people multi-source group data

266
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,980
sharing your all kind of sending

267
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,920
messages may be in kind of like a

<font color="#E5E5E5">BitTorrent swarm type situation and</font>

solution of using regular tour with some

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,730
external facilitators that basically

echoes things back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forth to the</font>

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:55,050
shadow and simulations in tort or path

278
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,940

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sanity checks but also business</font>

280
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:05,910
scalability reasons so some results on

281
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,250
multicast tour and surprisingly saves

282
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,260
tour bandwidth in other words tour has a

283
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,780
finite amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bandwidth if you're</font>

284
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,870
going to kind of use audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> conferencing</font>

285
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:20,569
using google hangout versus mtor we save

286
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,910
tour about a up to a three-fold

287
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:27,420
depending on size of the group savings

288
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,120
in bandwidth that's that's required so

289
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:34,979
it scales nicely the more clients you

290
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deaths or the more bandwidth</font>

291
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,870
savings you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the vanilla</font>

292
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:41,600

293
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of from the client centric view</font>

this is these are cumulative

296
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,740
the x-axis is transmission time measured

299
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,800
everybody's kind of sending each other

300
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,540
big chunks of data and you see that well

301
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,069
our savings are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know significant we</font>

302
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,030
have seventy percent reduction in the

303
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,950
median and for audio conferencing for

304
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,390
vanilla tour we find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know about</font>

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the connections just</font>

306
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't work because the latency is so</font>

307
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,779
huge and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know if you</font>

308
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,430
doing

309
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,249
wave anything above like two seconds is

310
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:25,670
kind of useless anyway it'll be too

311
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:27,230
painful so we do better not just the

312
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,029
median but kind of it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

313
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:35,149
important measure is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut off here at</font>

314
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:37,699
the top what about anonymity<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

315
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:39,259
kind of hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to look at it was</font>

316
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,540
kind of an interesting challenge because

317
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:43,189
how you define anonymity for group

318
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,059
communication is non-trivial and it

319
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:49,099
really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what you're trying</font>

320
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,139
trying to get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your communication</font>

321
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,269
system so if you consider traffic

322
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:56,240
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're going to my</font>

323
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,860
previous talk or more generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,160
adversary wins in that case if it can

325
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in the clients in grass side and the</font>

326
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,389
egress side and then it can correlate

327
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,370
the two and say okay great I can figure

328
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:10,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">out where this client is coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from and</font>

329
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,370
where he's going and I win in the

330
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,379
multicast scenario well there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> exit</font>

331
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,970
everything is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in grass traffic</font>

332
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,170
going into the network everything all

333
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,059
the traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in through the</font>

334
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,329
guards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out through the guards so</font>

335
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:26,540
there's and there's multiple senders and

336
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:29,779
receiver so we say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clients</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

337
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,490
the multicast group are linked if the

338
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,709
adversary observes each of their guards

339
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,420
traffic and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

340
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,609
flee something hopefully not too

341
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,889
arbitrary that we came up with and we're

342
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,209
also interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> membership</font>

343
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,730
identification or enumeration attacks

344
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,888
how easily is an adversary able to

345
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:50,389
enumerate the numbers the members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

346
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:52,100
multicast group we borrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the human</font>

347
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:56,660
understandable metrics from a from a

paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a Aaron Paul robbing myself</font>

352
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,889
skip the compromise rate for now the

353
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:12,259
details are in the paper but in our

354
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:14,329
experimental setup the adversary had a

355
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,819
ton of bandwidth as much as at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

356
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:19,040
that the study was done the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour</font>

357
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,599
family which and the adversary is going

358
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,189
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bandwidth to operate guard</font>

359
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,100
relays to attract as much traffic as

360
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:28,040
possible and we simulated the adversary

361
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:32,199
and mtor using a modified version of

362
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,199
torps so

363
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,230
what we find is that we don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

364
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,270
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mixed results the member</font>

365
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,950
membership identification really depends

366
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">on how lucky the client is in selecting</font>

367
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,600
its guard now importantly this was done

368
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,700
before tour before tour changed how it

369
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,680
does its default guard selection

370
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,910
strategy so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> today the results</font>

371
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,280
would actually be significantly better

372
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,140
and more secure than this really what

373
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,270
this is a measure of is how lucky are

374
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,250
you in selecting a good guard if you

375
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">select a bad guard then that guard can</font>

376
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,000
figure out that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a multicast</font>

377
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,829
group if you choose a good guard then

378
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,520
you're okay my overtime<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay really on</font>

379
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,200
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in summary mtor enables low</font>

380
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,630
latency anonymous group communication

381
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:20,010
it's kels gracefully to the size of the

382
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:21,660
multicast group and using data from the

383
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,210
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour network we show that we have</font>

384
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,660
significantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> improved performance and</font>

385
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:31,580
we can make this practical for<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font>
