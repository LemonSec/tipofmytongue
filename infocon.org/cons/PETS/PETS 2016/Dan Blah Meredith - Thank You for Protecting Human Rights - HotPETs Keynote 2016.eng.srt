10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,150
sideshow goes from the technical work

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,550
you're doing I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be as</font>

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,380
visually I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to visually</font>

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,180
fulfill you but I have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two slides</font>

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,260
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show mostly because it</font>

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,590
too much traveling but i guess to start

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,309

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,750
for doing work that you maybe don't

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,089
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are doing which is</font>

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,980
supporting human rights and increasing

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,210
human rights all over the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,160
know if you start doing the work that

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,739
you're doing thinking about that at all

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">but um I'm very appreciative of a large</font>

24
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,019
number of you all that are doing that so

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,609
that was really slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of two it was</font>

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,559
for a second I don't know if anybody's

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,409
playing pokemon go or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm probably</font>

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">not in this room that much but I</font>

29
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,530
definitely have set up a profile on my

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,010
phone to play a little bit so I've been

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,759
thinking about it a lot so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">start off with that thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and then a</font>

33
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,159
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick sort of intro of who I am and</font>

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,810
how I got here and and then I think what

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,439
we're going to do is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,829
you some stories of some some people

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,639
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think whose human rights have</font>

38
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,880
been I think we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped</font>

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,690
this is distracting me thank you though

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,600
man that was a good effort so tell you

41
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,830
some stories highlight some technologies

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are really important and</font>

43
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,530
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you some themes just as as as</font>

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,759
roger was saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been really</font>

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,950
important to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we developed to</font>

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,259
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what technologies and</font>

47
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,700
what efforts are worth supporting and

48
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,619
hopefully not going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for very</font>

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,720
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i really want you to</font>

50
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,040
go to ask me anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,459
whether it's related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk that</font>

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i presented or specific</font>

53
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,620
technologies the open Technology Fund or

54
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:18,140
just anything in this field so I'm going

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me about 10 15 years ago I</font>

56
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,958
was sort of taught by a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

57
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentors out to be a software developer</font>

58
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,910
and got involved in security in the late

59
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:32,130
90s and wireless networks ultimately

60
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,870
just got really disenfranchised and it

61
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,700
didn't sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good about doing it</font>

62
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,780
for banks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other big companies and</font>

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,940
got involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an organization called</font>

64
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Indymedia in the early 2000s and</font>

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,989
building radio stations all over

66
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">America's and I started sort of</font>

67
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,190
identifying as more of a sort of a

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,560
public interest software developer or

69
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,510
hacker or rather than someone who was

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">just doing code for anything else that</font>

71
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,660
led<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to Washington DC actually and</font>

72
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,709
around the 2000s or<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid-2000s working</font>

73
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,380
for an organization called the open

74
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,110
Technology Institute in New America and

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,140
then during the Arab revolutions I got

76
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,250
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about helping folks that were</font>

77
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,109
farther away and got<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled into al</font>

78
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,640
Jazeera where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk a little bit</font>

79
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,690
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that later but part of my job was</font>

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,890
to do technical investigations be a part

81
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,630
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> journalists team and then the</font>

82
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">other half of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to increase</font>

83
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,489
the security and privacy of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

84
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,299
sources and journalists in the field did

85
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,530
that for a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

86
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,150
ultimately just got really fed up with

87
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the sort of the state of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play in</font>

88
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the technology that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there to</font>

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,959
solve those challenges and was asked to

90
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,540
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the this thing called the</font>

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,400
open Technology Fund in 2012 and I've

92
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,439
been doing that for the last four years

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,400
so I said about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to do</font>

94
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,129
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I've got a couple questions</font>

95
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,900
I think I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all first and</font>

96
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,819
I've already used a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of jargon</font>

97
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,930
Public Interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologists</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Human</font>

98
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rights technologists it's not going to</font>

99
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,470
be as jargony as some of the technical

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,179
talks but if you've got a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

101
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,370
in an acronym or anything just raise

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,019
your hand or like shot it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out be very</font>

103
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,000
informal feel like you can interrupt me

104
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,170
I do that enough myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to</font>

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">break down what it is that you didn't</font>

106
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:17,829
understand but just as a real quick show

107
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:20,168
of hands how many of you all have heard

108
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,860
of the phrase Public Interest technology

109
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:25,719
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good this is this is what I</font>

110
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,370
have some ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you in the room</font>

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to like validator or break</font>

112
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,560
those things down and then of those like

113
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,840
five maybe six people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise your</font>

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,400
hands how many of you would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

115
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,229
you're a public interest technologist

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so about the same you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

117
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:45,219
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then what about human</font>

118
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,960
rights technology is anybody heard this

119
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,210
phrase used before human rights

120
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,090
technology about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same but different</font>

121
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,120
hands this is good and then as far as a

122
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,099
human rights technologist anybody a

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,990
little bit smaller minus two or three

124
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,949
hands right okay thank you now so the

125
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,900
reason why I bring this up is because

126
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,780
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of a new thing right</font>

127
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,219
it's like is is this not just a

128
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,750
technologist not just a software

129
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,280
developer not just a cryptographer but

130
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,080
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where your motivations are and</font>

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,520
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I like I have</font>

132
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,349
this assumption about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

133
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,820
room is how much more motivated you are

134
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,949
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like public interest in human rights</font>

135
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,750
rather than just like sort of that the

136
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:23,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology itself or privacy is sort of</font>

137
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,849
an ideal and and I shouldn't have that I

138
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,869
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be working harder to get more of</font>

139
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,460
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise your hands so that when i</font>

140
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,229

141
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,109
someone else asked that question there's

142
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,449
more hands in the air thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

143
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,320
um so I'm going to come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

144
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,550
open Technology Fund is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> first how</font>

145
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,710
many of you have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open</font>

146
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,090
Technology Fund oh wow how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

147
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,560
are getting supported by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

148
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,570
Technology Fund or have been supported

149
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,039
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open Technology Fund what about</font>

150
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,240
partners<font color="#CCCCCC"> our collaborators Wow gives me</font>

151
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,669
goosebumps is why I can't play poker

152
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,990
with the short sleeve shirt because

153
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,520
whenever i get excited or have a good

154
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,470
hander about hand everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it</font>

155
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,729
well that makes me I'm a little bit

156
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,870
glowing right y'all<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's quite</font>

157
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,090
and realized so many of you all were in

158
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and this is just the cost of</font>

159
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,909
and I'll get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this later of sort of</font>

160
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,289
what happened with OTF very recently is

161
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,750
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

162
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i really wish i knew more of better</font>

163
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,150
in rooms like this that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

164
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,190
when you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing more work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

165
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,270
OTF started in 2012 we've we are

166
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,730
predominately supported by the US

167
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,200
government we receive we've had a really

168
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,790
crazy budget on one and it's been like

169
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,430
three million another min another<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

170
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,370
we got twelve point seven five million

171
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,510
most of that comes through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,290

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,220
expression free speech freedom of

177
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,140
thought and then a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit further</font>

178
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,270
down there's this very<font color="#E5E5E5"> American centric</font>

179
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,599
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet freedom that's become a</font>

180
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,280
much bigger than American<font color="#CCCCCC"> centrica idea</font>

181
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,650
of where those freedoms should be

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,960
protected and supported online and on

183
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other communication mediums</font>

184
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,719
and that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where it came the</font>

185
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,670
past as far as OTF sexists in 2012 they

186
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,850
realized that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as technologically</font>

187
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:21,190
goes they weren't doing enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

188
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,750
of reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out into communities like this</font>

189
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,480
and make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy and approachable</font>

190
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,830
for an individual or groups too

191
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,170
assertive support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their really good</font>

192
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,130
ideas that we're increasing free

193
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,960
expression and so OTF came to pass as a

194
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,000
more approachable<font color="#CCCCCC"> thunder for these</font>

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,390
projects and we we focus on technology

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,310
centric efforts that are first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

197
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,159
foremost on increasing more unfettered

198
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,580
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet but also very</font>

199
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,870
much related to trying to stop

200
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:56,289
repressive surveillance and repressive

201
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,400
privacy invasions blackouts all kinds of

202
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,840
really interesting stuff and then

203
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,280
awareness programs that help<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

204
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,510
tools and technologies that you're

205
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,960
creating or the research that you're

206
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,490
doing more publicly available but mostly

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,960
text centric efforts so again we start

208
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">in 2012 and we really believe we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

209
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,479
a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ideals and principles that</font>

210
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,100
really

211
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,050
guide our work and that's partly because

212
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,610
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know the landscape</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

213
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,660
changing so quickly and if you're more

214
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in sort of what we believe</font>

215
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,100
beyond just that everyone has a right to

216
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,770
free to speak freely without any

217
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,060
repressive censorship or surveillance

218
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,409
check out our website you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

219
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,720
mission our ideals you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

220
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,300
projects we supported there as well we

221
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,700
try really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to be as transparent and</font>

222
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,109
accountable through that as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so</font>

223
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,710
you can see almost everyone we<font color="#CCCCCC"> funded</font>

224
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,990
unless there is some sort of privacy

225
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,780
concern that's significant so just some

226
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,880
numbers at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we have over 200</font>

227
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,300
different fellows and projects we've

228
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,710
supported in the last four years and

229
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,270
some just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need five thousand dollars to</font>

230
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,190
go travel somewhere hundred dollars to

231
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,069
travel somewhere an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

232
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:03,690
others such as tour we give almost a

233
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:07,410
million dollars a year to we we started

234
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:10,740
off having to beg 12 very trusting souls

235
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,020
to take our money in 2012 and had to

236
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,430
really convince them that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

237
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea and now we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about 100 150</font>

238
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:24,000
applications every two months so we've

239
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,950
got at this point you know over a couple

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,300
thousand applications and it's it's

241
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,870
become a thing we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend a lot of</font>

242
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,930
time following<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to pivoting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

243
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,280
thing of where so much comes to us

244
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,099
that's or viewing applications in our

245
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,839
review process is sort of our biggest

246
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:44,490
way of learning now which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

247
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,440
interesting we start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> with maybe you</font>

248
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a few hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand of millions</font>

249
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,980
a couple million people that were making

250
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,330
use of technologies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd say like</font>

251
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're Internet freedom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies or</font>

252
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Human Rights technologies to gain access</font>

253
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,280
or increase their privacy security

254
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,840
online and now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

255
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:02,220
something like over a billion going on

256
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,350
two billion people<font color="#CCCCCC"> making use of</font>

257
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,030
technologies at OTF and or our

258
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,300
partnering funders are supporting which

259
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:12,420
is pretty daunting and impressive but

260
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,130
also cool um and we've spent about 30 to

261
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,930
40 million dollars about 35 million

262
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,990
dollars in the last four years so that's

263
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,760
OTF by the numbers um so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

264
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,680
questions about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bring that up and</font>

265
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,390
totally willing to answer anything I can

266
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,390
or know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the question section</font>

267
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,949
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just behind the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scenes</font>

268
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,900
of OT FM just going to skip over right

269
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,500
now so this next section again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

270
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell some stories I got about four</font>

271
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,740
four stories and sort of accompanying

272
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,620
projects that I'm going to frame why I

273
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">think human rights technology as it sort</font>

274
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,170
of broader context for the privacy

275
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,910
enhancing technology that you are doing

276
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:49,360
are incredibly important at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least in my</font>

277
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,680
day to day and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to those next two</font>

278
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,790
billion 3 billion people that are going

279
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be coming online the next few years</font>

280
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,930
sewing tell a story not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

281
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,100
really clear like there's some projects

282
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,030
here that I'm not going to talk about

283
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,530
for example tour partly because it's we

284
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,209
all know it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think I</font>

285
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,560
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all how awesome tour is</font>

286
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,080
and why it's important to this community

287
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,089
of what not and it gets talked about a

288
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,500
lot so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about some</font>

289
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">other really popular projects as well</font>

290
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,470
but and I'm also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ground these</font>

291
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,880
stories in a set of themes I want to

292
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,380
introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all at the end that are</font>

293
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us and I hope you</font>

294
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,290
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when you're choosing</font>

295
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:29,260
which projects you work on moving

296
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:30,400
forward so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rania oh and</font>

297
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,470
these are based on real people that I'm

298
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to use any real names I'm</font>

299
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try to like keep the story part</font>

300
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,470
where I'm talking about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

301
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,880
persona the person pretty light just to

302
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,470
protect privacy but I'm also happy to

303
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,700
give a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more details if you want to</font>

304
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,210
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to me afterwards and ask about a</font>

305
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:50,290
specific story so I pardon for that um

306
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:54,520
so the the first is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iranian woman is</font>

307
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:58,390
is self-hosting and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iranian virtual a</font>

308
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,760
VPS in Iran and she's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

309
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,860
documentation of information controls or

310
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,069
sort of what's happening on the network

311
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,540
within Iran as far as policy things so

312
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,340
what the what the legal regimes are

313
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,349
doing to try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> influence what they can</font>

314
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,810
and cannot track and block and went on

315
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,010
and she wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade her for a</font>

316
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,989
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different good reason she wants</font>

317
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,319
to upgrade her her hosting solution to

318
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,960
the HTTPS and part of that is to protect

319
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,950
the privacy of where she and who when

320
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,000
she's submitting and what she's

321
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,670
submitting the others<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the people</font>

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are visiting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our website one of the</font>

323
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,160
challenges that she<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bumping into it</font>

324
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs money it requires a bit of</font>

325
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,600
knowledge and it takes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to do</font>

326
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,649
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the time of knowledge</font>

327
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
part isn't

328
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,850
a limitation<font color="#CCCCCC"> first she knows how to do</font>

329
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,499
it she's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it she's</font>

330
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,519
committed to do it but the fact that it

331
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:49,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs money is actually a bit of a</font>

332
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem in Iran and so pretty recently</font>

333
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:54,040
most of the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> issuers are us</font>

334
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,480
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> European based and they have</font>

335
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,129
sanctions that don't allow her to use

336
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,420
her money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually purchase her</font>

337
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:09,129
certificate and and this is a real

338
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:12,128
problem so the the solution here at

339
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:14,139
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> for her was you know a get someone</font>

340
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,939
else to purchase it which sort of wasn't

341
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,470
the nicest thing wanted to be able to do

342
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it herself and then of course let's</font>

343
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,540
encrypt coming up pretty recently how

344
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,498
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people know of let's encrypt</font>

345
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,360
awesome right this is an easy i'm

346
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,490
starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easy ones first so</font>

347
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,170
that's you hopefully you'll you'll

348
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,139
you'll come across so let's encrypt in

349
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,459
this case um you know it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

350
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:35,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theme on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top it takes a</font>

351
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,809
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been sort of a real</font>

352
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">market driven problem in a lot of ways</font>

353
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:43,029
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really long time and it just they</font>

354
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:45,160
automated<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crap out of it they made</font>

355
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:49,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">it free and now they're what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

356
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number three biggest issuer of</font>

357
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:54,399
public facing certificates on the planet

358
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,379
and they did that in what like six

359
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,660
months eight months or something like

360
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:00,699
that really and i know i think set from

361
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,740
eff is here I don't know where he's at

362
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:04,929
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he's here you should find him and</font>

363
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,059
bother him more about let's encrypt but

364
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:08,649
this is one of those things where it

365
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,410
didn't really it they have they are

366
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:15,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot but like on the on the model</font>

367
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,689
of how important this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for Turkish</font>

368
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,459
bloggers right now folks that are also

369
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,800
self-hosting while that country

370
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:22,839
continues to slide the fact that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

371
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,029
easy for them to get certificates and

372
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,100
not even that that there's tools to

373
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:30,999
automate the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> process for</font>

374
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,110
their servers is I mean getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> goose</font>

375
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">bumps again because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of</font>

376
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,869
stories we get back and this isn't a

377
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,980
project that we're supporting and i

378
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:38,379
should say some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these projects we're</font>

379
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,420
not supporting directly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think are</font>

380
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,529
really big contributors to this and if

381
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,259
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting we should be</font>

382
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">supporting in this case some of these</font>

383
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,889
projects but um we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get we get a lot</font>

384
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,449
of emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how like this is the</font>

385
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:52,940
boring stuff that should be happening

386
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,950
to increase human rights rather than

387
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,910
sort of creating a brand new thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

388
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:02,780
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share that with first the next</font>

389
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,850
is related and this isn't quite a

390
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,170
persona<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a person but it involves a</font>

391
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,760
whole lot of people that are really

392
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,920
troubled and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of</font>

393
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,770
personally for me in a later story you

394
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large instant messaging app</font>

395
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,680
the largest in the world wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

396
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:22,490
upgrade its transport layer protocol and

397
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,400
it looks at TLS in the last two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

398
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,930
I'm glad to see these these bugs come

399
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,290
out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks at TLS looks at as a</font>

400
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,569
cell and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like Oh some</font>

401
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,849
liability there what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

402
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">if like this messaging service that's</font>

403
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,600
being used by both Americans and

404
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,250
Europeans but also has a really high

405
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,440
adoption rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highest adoption rate</font>

407
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,520
countries that have unfortunate

408
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,890
repressive regimes when it comes to free

409
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,430
expression privacy and surveillance and

410
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,600
they what they decide to do is is sort

411
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,060
of a numerate these challenges they say

412
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,760
well TLS was this develop in the 90s the

413
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,339
first spec<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think came out in like 99</font>

414
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,280
TLS one point was definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

415
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,430
world that doesn't exist today and it's

416
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,959
grown over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's iterated but</font>

417
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,239
it's it's definitely got a very large

418
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,830
protocol a large specification rather

419
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,050
that translates to an implementation

420
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,510
attack service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to try to</font>

421
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,030
implement the whole specification and

422
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:26,660
I'm going to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a con in this</font>

423
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,060
case but being managed by ETF is means

424
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,939
it's slow to iterate it's developed by a

426
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,380
positives there for all those folks I

427
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,729
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF meeting in Berlin and</font>

428
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,890
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some pauses but in</font>

429
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,750
this case it's proving hard to sort of

430
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,430
iterate quick enough to keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

431
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,460
concerns and the failures before but

432
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,199
also the environment today so what did

433
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,370
they do in this case we're talking about

434
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:55,280
whatsapp well they decided to use their

435
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,630
own or a not their own but a completely

436
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,390
different one an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source protocol</font>

437
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,300
called the the noise protocol framework

438
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,439
which is sort of confusing on if you

439
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know about anybody heard of that</font>

440
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
one

441
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,329
the noise protocol a little bit less

442
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you can see this is the trend</font>

443
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,188
hopefully so the noise protocol

444
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,319
framework is a guy by<font color="#E5E5E5"> trevor parent</font>

445
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:19,970
who's here so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> go talk to him</font>

446
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:21,649
some more you find him and I don't know

447
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,540
enough to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

448
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,650
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say but the idea being that</font>

449
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,730
it's a TLS like protocol and I don't

450
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,350
want to say that it's a drop-in

451
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,340
replacement but it allows folks that

452
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,699
have different motivations to have an

453
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,559
alternative and you know it's a simpler

454
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,710
more modern protocol it's got a higher

455
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,540
security cryptography as I understand it

456
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,419
as an onica tog refers so someone can

457
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:51,168
kick me if I'm wrong about that later

458
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:53,360
and it it also has sort of specified

459
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:56,290
more the specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> has more</font>

460
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,820
guarantees for deniability and and

461
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,860
identity hiding and it's also faster

462
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,939
more scalable so if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

other scaling issues it's a good

468
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,440
alternative so that's that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,110
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the collateral damage of</font>

568
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,168
blocking websites in china increasingly

569
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,610
Iran and other countries is is

570
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,410
significant economically as in there are

571
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,969
so many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in China for purely</font>

572
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,910
economic reasons running their own

573
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,000
businesses that need access to you know

574
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">CloudFlare or Google or Amazon Web</font>

575
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,440
Services or any of these other sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

576
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,540
big international frameworks that to

577
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,490
block them would cause not just social

578
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,770
upheaval like blocking facebook social

579
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,059
network but actually economic and people

580
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,129
so they they call this collateral

581
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,540
freedom like the collateral damage means

582
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,070
that there's this collateral freedom of

583
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,210
these people who want to make use of

584
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:42,230
these services<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're these on block</font>

585
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:44,900
sites and then on top of that they

586
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,240
mostly offer pretty easily affordably or

587
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,290
by default https connections and this is

588
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,990
where it becomes a privacy enhancing

589
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,240
technology aspect for me in that it's

590
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,409
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't block amazon com</font>

591
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,840
or AWS amazon com it's that by default

592
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:02,840
https AWS amazon com is available and

593
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore you you've your you've got</font>

594
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,418
some privacy properties included with

595
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,860
doing this um so the there's two

596
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,970
specific projects here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out and the first one I already</font>

598
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,190
did which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet which is really</font>

599
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">great because it's sort of tool agnostic</font>

600
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,450
it's a library<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think of is sort</font>

601
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,070
of extensible and portable for other

602
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:28,880
tools whether you're a proprietary VPN

607
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,699
accounts on these different services and

608
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,140
all of a sudden get these properties of

domain fronting and collateral freedom

612

it to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about that and the other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is this project called great fire which</font>

619
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:58,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">is taken a completely different track</font>

620
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,409
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where it veers a little bit</font>

621
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:02,450
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from privacy enhancing technologies</font>

trying to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out more global</font>

629
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:19,519
youtube and see like what their aunt

630
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:22,700
uncle are doing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago and in this</font>

631
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,499
case they've created a way to mirror

632
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,969
websites a set of tools and scripts to

633
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:28,429
just mere any website put it on an

<font color="#CCCCCC">Amazon server a caching server and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

635
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,190
create a new link for that and then

636
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,959
disseminate that really easy through a

637
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,459
browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> extension so you're not getting</font>

638
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:36,349
the multi out proxy you're not getting

639
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:37,729
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you owe on on privacy protection</font>

640
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:41,589
but you are getting a tool that

641
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:41,589
increases access much much much easier

642
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:50,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we got one more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story how's</font>

643
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:52,399
everyone doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay whew thumbs up</font>

644
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:55,639
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking at their</font>

645
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:58,399
laptops just<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hate some more okay</font>

646
00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:00,139
so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is this one's super</font>

647
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,518
personal for me this one is and I've

648
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:03,468
said this one before so I'm sorry for

649
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,379
those who may be heard it but um in this

650
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:08,659
case it's another sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Arab Arab</font>

651
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:10,908
revolution story I alluded that earlier

652
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:15,759
so when I when I took on this job in two

653
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:19,639
thousand 2010-2011 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Al Jazeera I</font>

654
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,409
didn't realize how both<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult in and</font>

655
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:25,070
easy at the same time it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

656
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the difficult work I mean the hardest</font>

657
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,339
job I've ever had you've got sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

658
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:30,228
the field who sent you a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font>

659
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:31,458
and call you on the phone and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

660
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,899
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get one of those text messages and</font>

661
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:36,469
on the phone you just like a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

662
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:38,119
of you just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh because especially</font>

663
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:41,149
if the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they just left you</font>

664
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,499
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone call they sent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you was</font>

665
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:46,399
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you knew his newsworthy</font>

666
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:49,999
because you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like who else just</font>

667
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:51,829
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so my first job was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

668
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:54,169
figure out tools and technologies that

669
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:56,509
would help increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the safety for these</font>

670
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:58,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and our journalists</font>

671
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:02,479
and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

672
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:05,649
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you remember that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

673
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:09,619
in my 2010-2011 for your average person

674
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:12,889
who didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any technological mind</font>

675
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:16,070
at all and you know the result was I

676
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:17,478
would get a text message<font color="#CCCCCC"> or mostly my</font>

677
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,519
colleagues rather than I would get a

678
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:21,049
text<font color="#CCCCCC"> message or phone call I hear about</font>

679
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">this and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't hear from them</font>

680
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:25,820
again and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale of what was</font>

681
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,708
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening to to these journalists</font>

682
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,569
sources which we all know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now has</font>

683
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:32,329
become public knowledge was some of them

684
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:34,369
were fleeing because they knew that they

685
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:36,259
had access to something that was putting

686
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:38,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">their family or themselves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in danger</font>

687
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:42,769
they were getting arrested detained

688
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:44,509
tortured and some killed and and a

689
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,859
completely other story that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

690
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:48,169
anything to do with me but when I came

691
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:50,029
into this job but I find is is a little

692
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,219
bit a little bit lighter heart as in

693
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,919
knowing no one getting tortured detained

694
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:56,719
or killed that we know of but um when I

695
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,940
when I took this job I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spent</font>

696
00:26:56,719 --> 00:27:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">some time in Vietnam and had some</font>

697
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,169
conversations with some Vietnamese

698
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:04,909
activists who had this sort of

699
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:06,529
light-hearted sort of oh it's just the

700
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,119
way it is no harm<font color="#E5E5E5"> done sort of story</font>

701
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:11,059
where it was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when we first</font>

702
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">started doing or activism work we these</font>

703
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,418
tales would with these these

704
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:15,909
intelligence officers or local police

705
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:18,999
would just start following us around

706
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:21,649
they asked us all these questions hey

707
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:23,179
who's that you were talking to who's

708

that where were you at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other night</font>

00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:27,109
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they sort of</font>

710
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:29,299
almost became friendly because they knew

711
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:30,918
these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> war they these people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

712
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:32,329
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them and they would just</font>

713
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of expect them there and then one</font>

714
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:36,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">day they just literally stopped showing</font>

715
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,879
up and they way they were framed this or

716
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,988
psycho they sort of missed their tails

717
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:40,759
like these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they dealt a</font>

718
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:42,109
relationship with who they'd spent so

719
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,209
much time with over the last like two or

720
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,789
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and they just they just they</font>

721
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:48,169
were gone and whether there's a common

722
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:51,199
theme here is and you know they were

723
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking us you know to validate their</font>

724
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:56,059
assumptions of why they were gone and

725
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,889
and of course this room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now with a</font>

726
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:59,839
lot of disclosures we know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

727
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:01,579
was going on we know the capabilities of

728
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,589
small and large countries when it comes

729
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,599
to surveillance of unencrypted messages

730
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:07,639
so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first story the reason why</font>

731
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,580
these these sources were disappearing

732
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:12,550
was because they were sending plain text

733
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,010
airplane text messages unencrypted phone

734
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,680
conversations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

735
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:20,320
them to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> targeted and and and dealt</font>

736
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">with by those regimes and in the case of</font>

737
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,620
the Vietnamese it was really easy to

738
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">just stop it was obviously like no</font>

739
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer economical to follow them around</font>

740
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,890
all day because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had their phone</font>

741
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,510
tracking information they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

742
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,200
their text messages they could read they

743
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,000
could listen to their voice

744
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,460
conversations and so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they</font>

745
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,350
would target them and that would be it

746
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:44,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so coming back to the the challenge</font>

747
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:47,709
is there you know Indian encryption on

748
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,530
mobile devices at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time just didn't</font>

749
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,610
exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exception of you</font>

750
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,990
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your going to know where I'm</font>

751
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,300
going and it's another big ones this

752
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be an easy one and this was an</font>

753
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,010
early version of tech secure by open or

754
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,300
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> whisper scissors at the time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

755
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">same is true for the Vietnamese as soon</font>

756
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,260
as they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> using tech secure this</font>

757
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,930
is before we met them guess who came

758
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,670
back around<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're old friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

759
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,950
like it literally within a week after

760
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:15,880
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all started using textsecure back</font>

761
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,960
in like 2011 2000-2010 you all their

762
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,580
friends come back and everyone's like

763
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,080
what's just you know they asking the

764
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,879
same questions and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really asking</font>

765
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,350
them about this tool that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

766
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> partly is because the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

767
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">are falling in they don't really</font>

768
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,980
understand at this time even like there

769
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,959
was an understanding that like

770
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,180
encryption was happening yet like it is

771
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,940
is part of the public discourse and only

772
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,530
what four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years five years since but at</font>

773
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time that was about as usable as it</font>

774
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,030
got but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that was um and that</font>

775
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">which is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an option in an encryption</font>

776
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:45,010
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a phone and then and then if we were</font>

777
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,170
honest and we're still honest like in an

778
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,520
encryption on a computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

779
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,710
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it could but going back four or</font>

780
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,600
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years it was also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult</font>

781
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,120
like I think this the status quo would

782
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,800
have been a nig<font color="#E5E5E5"> male with Thunderbird</font>

783
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,179
which is fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> for probably almost</font>

784
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,430
everyone in this room or a lot of people

785
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you aren't the most</font>

786
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:06,460
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to be considering when</font>

787
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:09,880
what what is usable in what is easy so

788
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,880
in this case of course signal signals

789
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,740
precursor text textsecure red phone and

790
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,750
all pulling out just signal doing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

791
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,490
is the technology that we're

792
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,800
highlighting here is how useful it's

793
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,310
been for human rights purposes for

794
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,050
people that are really on the

795
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:27,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> far end of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spectrum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting</font>

796
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,510
repressed and I don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

797
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the event i think everyone everyone</font>

798
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:34,610
knows signal and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course whatsapp I</font>

799
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,780
mean if is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody is anyway not I don't</font>

800
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,850
want to do that cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't call you out</font>

801
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,800
so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know what</font>

802
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,240
signal or the signal protocol it's being

803
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,290
used in what to have now you've got over

804
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,370
well if you count all the other

805
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,560
implementation got over<font color="#E5E5E5"> two billion</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people making use of a thing and of</font>

807
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,220
course why is that massively positive

808
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,490
it's normalized encryption on the line

809
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,020
for one thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tour you</font>

810
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,420
know I think you've got a lot of

811
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:04,790
encryption happening beyond its HTTPS

812
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:06,410
making it very very very easy for for

813
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,720
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> new activists with a new social</font>

them to be and just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years ago</font>

817
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,100
so I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to quickly say again</font>

818
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,750
some other notable projects because

819
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,340
these are just chosen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some</font>

820
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,880
points that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make here in a</font>

821
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,860
second I've already said tour

822
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,690
approaching I'm not endorsing necessary

823
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,679
that I think these are amazing projects

824
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just saying I think they fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

criteria of privacy enhancing

increasing human rights or are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

828
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,520
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all will get involved</font>

00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it at some point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you've got tor</font>

835
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,730
are either dealing directly with

836
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:00,710
encryption or doing things to increase

837
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:02,270
privacy in their own way and I think if

838
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,130
you have more if you have thoughts any

839
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:11,840
of those come ask me and I'm happy to

840
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:12,950
share more um how you feeling yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

841
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,480
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this next part really</font>

842
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,310
quickly and then leave a lot for

843
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,810
questions so these are this is a theme

844
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,010
section of like stuff that I find is

845
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,149
really important helps me like figure

846
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,230
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> which of these projects are right</font>

847
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,480
and which ones are important and

848
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,860
ultimately keep me grounded what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

849
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,780
is most important in the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do</font>

850
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,399
and the first and foremost and I like I

851
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,860
see a few you smiling because I know who

852
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,720
you are and how you think and you smile

853
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,419
at a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've said but</font>

854
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,050
that is um think first and foremost

855
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,250
about the

856
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,370
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're hoping to</font>

857
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">affect and think about them the most and</font>

858
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,810
never stop thinking about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

859
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,639
is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tenant for</font>

860
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-design and co-development when you're</font>

861
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,970
doing something it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just good</font>

862
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,010
enough to have a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and then</font>

863
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,000
prototype it and then hope that it's

864
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be relevant for a group of</font>

865
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,540
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore I don't know if it was</font>

866
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,820
ever really good idea to do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin</font>

867
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,730
with but it's now too easy to not like

868
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,050
it's too easy to just reach out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

869
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,390
group find out like what they think

870
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,200
about a thing and in particular when

871
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,350
you're talking about human rights

872
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,540
technology um you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just</font>

873
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:14,209
users they're like the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

874
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,280
people and and they are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

875
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,170
the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room going to make</font>

876
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,270
some broad demographic assertions are

877
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,370
not going to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones most advantage</font>

878
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:25,190
or affected by the things that you do

879
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,780
well or the things that you do wrong and

880
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a whole other group</font>

881
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,010
of people that are probably not

882
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,260
represented widely here so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font>

883
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,790
about that and if you ever looking for

884
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">funding those funders are thinking this</font>

885
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,490
way now so someone's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remind you</font>

886
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,580
along the way no matter how good a good

887
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:43,280
idea is going to be and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

888
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,629
point out too that for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people you</font>

889
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,840
know the challenges for them are so much

890
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:51,620
more acute and and what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font>

891
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">is because they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're so on on the</font>

892
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,189
farther side of the spectrum of what

893
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,389
they know when they know something

894
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,990
failed they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

895
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,400
failed until a much later thing at the

896
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,460
line in the in the adversaries here are

897
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,930
much more advanced as far as the space

898
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,790
between them and the adversaries that

899
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,650
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with I might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not say</font>

900
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,179
that like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob way government is</font>

901
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,340
advanced is the Vietnamese or the

902
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:15,139
Chinese of the American but the space

903
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,419
between the Zimbabwe government's

904
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,460
capabilities now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the shelf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

905
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:20,810
hockey team sort of things that are that

906
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,220
are now available for a government

907
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,870
doesn't a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> average</font>

908
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,939
citizen into the boffins op weight is in

909
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,370
Bob way excuse me is huge bigger than

910
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,870
it's ever been and the last like you

911
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,380
know maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-15 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since this</font>

912
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,759
technology to surveil oppressively and

913
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,890
since her oppressively has become

914
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,860
available so the costs are much greater

915
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,980
if you get it wrong and so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

916
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,320
that you just just just think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

917
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,179
you're trying to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and don't just</font>

918
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,500
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> at thinking about them try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

919
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,490
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to make them a part of</font>

920
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,960
the design process

921
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,479
of the architectures you're developing

922
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,820
and even better<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet make them part of</font>

923
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the development process so that they're</font>

924
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:03,680
there along the way and if you can't

925
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,430
have a good reason why you can because

926
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,549
there are some out there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next point</font>

927
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want I was just does anybody else</font>

928
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,580
think in like geometric shapes and

929
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,080
you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas squares</font>

930
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:19,220
circles triangles and things like okay

931
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,920
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about triangles</font>

932
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,919
and one triangle in particular and

933
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,619
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a couple of people in the</font>

934
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,869
audience who let me soundboard this off

935
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,760
them in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few days but</font>

936
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,900
in this case I wish I had I'm sorry I

937
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,310
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture you shouldn't talk</font>

938
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,170
about geometric shapes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not a picture</font>

939
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,820
but in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one it's it's a triangle of</font>

940
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,950
things that are really important when

941
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,660
we're ever thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about whether</font>

942
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,240
technologies were supporting within the

943
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,420
context of human right technology and in

944
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,169
it in at a very high level its power

945
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's excuse me its its its rights</font>

946
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,580
power and people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds</font>

947
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well whatever but let me break it</font>

948
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">down in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit little bit deeper</font>

949
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,770
so in this case rights the rights for

950
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,450
this conference in like the room in the

951
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,160
context what we're time is privacy

952
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the right the right to privacy</font>

953
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,839
and in this case let's go

954
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:11,060
technologically on on power and think

955
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,100
about architecture first and then think

956
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,900
of say like centralized versus

957
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,400
decentralized so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like a</font>

958
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,800
technological architecture that can

959
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,970
shift power it has a direct effect to

960
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,260
power and then if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

961
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,459
corner and some of you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

962
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,470
around for longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably have</font>

963
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,450
like well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a thing I know that</font>

964
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is and tell me if it is and then</font>

965
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,169
the other is people in technological

966
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:33,109
terms again we think about scale and

967
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,210
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like scale to like seven</font>

968
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:36,830
billion people it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be only need to</font>

969
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,450
affect like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten people's lives and need</font>

970
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do really well and so that's why that</font>

971
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,390
that is a higher level thing of people

972
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,920
rather than sort of like numbers of

973
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,609
people and so let's just take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

974
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples right so signal for example</font>

975
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:50,330
where does it fit on that triangle right

976
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,390
so when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to rights well it's</font>

977
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,520
definitely increasing encrypted

978
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,799
communication and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy of people</font>

979
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,759
in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that very few other projects</font>

980
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,710
were doing was it doing it in a

981
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,740
and a novel or like the most advanced

982
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,470
way that we know no well so behind the

983
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,060
scenes as far as like supporting

984
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:11,220
asynchronous communication yes but as

985
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,259
far as like deniability and like you

986
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,759
know knowledge of keys and other things

987
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,290
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's it's you know it's not</font>

988
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,770
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way on that but it's definitely</font>

989
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:21,750
over there and as far as as far as

990
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,910
people is it a protocol that scales to

991
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,830
billions of people well yes so that's we

992
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,690
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything like that and</font>

993
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:31,290
instant messaging before so it fits over

994
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,210
here now what about power well so it's

995
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,740
if we if we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> my example of arch and</font>

996
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,050
centralization versus decentralisation

997
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,580
well it's a centralized tool and it's

998
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,550
definitely centralizing power around

999
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:44,730
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know push service and</font>

1000
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,950
apples put service and the you know the

1001
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,510
open whispers server and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

1002
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatsapp it's all facebook</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's not</font>

1003
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,670
really shifting the power in in

1004
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,529
architecture terms all that much so it

1005
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,840
actually fits like over here it's very

1006
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,130
useful on sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and and the reason why</font>

1007
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,330
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that is because like in my</font>

1008
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,620
view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least I want to</font>

1009
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,360
balance of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things on the</font>

1010
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,250
triangle so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put all of our eggs in</font>

1011
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,050
a basket we're not really shifting power

1012
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,270
to the people we care a lot about now

1013
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,880
another example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of more new is</font>

1014
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:15,420
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> project called I PFS interplanetary</font>

1015
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">file system anybody cool cool this is a</font>

1016
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:23,280
following should look this one up so I

1017
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:25,319
PFS I PFS is a server look hopefully a

1018
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,880
server less especially they finished the

1019
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript implementation fully a</font>

1020
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,150
serverless sort of distributed file

1021
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,920
system built on you know it's got

1022
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,560
BitTorrent behind the scene of it it's

1023
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,120
got all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good sentiments stop</font>

1024
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,460
right there but they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a prototype</font>

1025
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,220
called orbit which is a chat app so I'm

1026
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to compare orbit to signal in this</font>

1027
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,209
case so in this case not really any

1028
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,060
encryption on top of the app at all

1029
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,820
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> https session so not doing</font>

1030
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">a whole lot on privacy now you look at</font>

1031
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,520
power the fact that it's server free and

1032
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:01,770
it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be booted up in a JavaScript or a</font>

1033
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,060
browser extension and doesn't have a

1034
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,470
centralized server except for the one

1035
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,520
that offers up that<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript that's</font>

1036
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,319
really doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> for power</font>

1037
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,630
dynamics there and then you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1038
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,490
other side of of people and it can

1039
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,790
theoretically scale pretty far so that's

1040
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,129
an interesting one sort of the other

1041
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,750
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the another other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the</font>

1042
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,890
triangle so i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to point that</font>

1043
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was like a thing we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about</font>

1044
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:24,160
and then there is shortening of the old

1045
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:26,740
versus new let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just compare to say</font>

1046
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,629
let's encrypt versus the noise protocol

1047
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,520
framework you've got let's encrypt which

1048
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,860
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking an old thing that needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1049
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,660
done better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's scaling it up like</font>

1050
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,520
crazy and automating the crap out of it

1051
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's keeping it around you've got</font>

1052
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,560
something like noise which is saying

1053
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:42,520
well TLS 1.3 maybe that'll answer our

1054
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,570
problems but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

1055
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,740
around for it so we're just going to

1056
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,150
presume it doesn't exist we're going to

1057
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a new thing we're constantly</font>

1058
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,880
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance those things out as</font>

1059
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,220
well and like have people prove to us

1060
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,290
the case for why they chose an old

1061
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,609
versus new solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same is true for</font>

1062
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,740
like standards and protocols you know

1063
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF vs posting anything on github or</font>

1064
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,180
learning and sharing traditional

1065
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,210
education versus like open pure learning

1066
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,549
and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot of you know where</font>

1067
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,460
you all sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on both sides and then the</font>

1068
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,410
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few things first thing is like open</font>

1069
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,180
source everything I don't there's just

1070
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,259
no excuse for it and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say</font>

1071
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this cross</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go</font>

1072
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,230
into like the advantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> and benefits of</font>

1073
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,690
it but you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be surprised how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

1074
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:23,020
people apply to the open Technology Fund

1075
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:24,040
and want like a proprietary license for

1076
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,900
their intellectual property and we're

1077
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,850
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you crazy you know like</font>

1078
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,320
this it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are and</font>

1079
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,940
it's not what we believe in so you know

1080
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,040
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of advantages</font>

1081
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,540
there if you want to go toe-to-toe with

1082
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,460
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that I'm happy to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font>

1083
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,110
then I finally want to say you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> TF</font>

1084
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,490
isn't just about supporting things that

1085
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,380
aren't through the traditional sort of

1086
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,910
academic peer review process<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font>

1087
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,140
like 30 40 papers at this point that

1088
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're responsible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for supporting people</font>

1089
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,940
to publish through conferences like pets

1090
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,110
you snakes in other academic places and

1091
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,880
we love that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just want to like</font>

1092
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,610
really give a nod to everyone out there

1093
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,590
who's doing that work of sticking in

1094
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,240
that space from theoretical to practical

1095
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,800
and not necessarily getting into the

1096
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,089
implementation and giving yourself at

1097
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,040
like sort of satisfaction when you're

1098
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,320
not into it because like every one of

1099
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,640
these projects that i mentioned you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1100
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,140
we're talking about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve</font>

1101
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,299
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two to three years out</font>

1102
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,720
but our problems of the day these papers

1103
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,160
were they all have a paper or five that

1104
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,990
are the basis for what they're doing

1105
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written five ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

1106
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,609
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge and</font>

1107
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,310
say thank you for that as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1108
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,570
gonna stop right there very hard cut and

1109
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,970
say thank you again first

1110
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,260
supporting human rights and I really

1111
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,490
appreciate work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love following what</font>

1112
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,080
you all are doing and I'm looking

1113
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,819
forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more from you in the</font>

1114
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,819
future and any questions
