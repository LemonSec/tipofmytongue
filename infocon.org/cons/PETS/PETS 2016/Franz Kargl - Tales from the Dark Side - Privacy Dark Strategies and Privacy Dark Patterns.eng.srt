1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:08,629
yeah thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduction and I'm</font>

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,790
now going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark side of</font>

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,769
privacy so not about how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,759
privacy but how people out there

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:22,140
actively try to get at your data and

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,160
basically violate your privacy we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,760
arguing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this happens in a very very</font>

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,980
structured way and in purposeful way

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,079
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to many websites or use</font>

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,880
apps or whatever and this is joint work

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,850
with my colleagues from the computer

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,210
science and psychology at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> University</font>

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,820
and I'm Frank<font color="#E5E5E5"> Agha so actually I'm not</font>

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,309
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of new stuff in</font>

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk because what I'm going to tell</font>

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you about is what you experience every</font>

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">day when you go to the internet when you</font>

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,269
use apps on your smartphone and I've

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">picked one example and I don't want to</font>

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,420
particularly blame tripadvisor here this

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just one example of millions</font>

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have that we could have chosen</font>

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,530
and when you when you open the

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,560
tripadvisor app on your smartphone it

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,869
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this and I</font>

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,290
mean if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole screen</font>

27
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,770
design it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to sign in</font>

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,100
right or to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an account so that</font>

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,289
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the app you can also skip it</font>

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,949
but this is carefully hidden up here at

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,840
the top and it also looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you the</font>

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,000
preferred way for you to use the app

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,670
would be to either sign up with google

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,220
or facebook and if you if you choose to

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">use facebook your facebook login you</font>

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,500
will see in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> small print that</font>

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,079
actually this app wants to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,869
a lot of data yeah your facebook profile

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,529
your friends list pictures current

40
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,170
location consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of other things</font>

41
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you may reconsider and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,229
probably i'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this and</font>

43
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,038
you may go back and and find this little

44
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,590
spit button and if you press there

45
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,920
the next thing that happens is there is

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,719
a pop-up telling you very clearly what

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,518
you're going to miss if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't create</font>

48
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:25,700
an account<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and such things happen</font>

49
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">in many areas of IT you have mandatory</font>

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,379
form fields you have unintelligible

51
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,659
privacy policies you have data

52
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:36,200
processing that violates privacy

53
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,760
principles and many more so it's clear

54
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us that there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people out</font>

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,840
there who want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get at your data the</font>

56
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,480
question is can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we identify patterns in</font>

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,419
such practices things that happen

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,310
regularly that he occur and that we can

59
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,829
identify and name and find

60
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,709
countermeasures against and why would

61
00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:01,129
having such a list of patterns such a

62
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalogue of patterns useful I mean</font>

63
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,970
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were better understand what's</font>

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,909
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we would also enable people to</font>

65
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,099
recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actively search such</font>

66
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,918
patterns in the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian app</font>

67
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:16,190
stores and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it would help us</font>

68
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,040
discuss strategies to circumvent and

69
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:22,250
fight such patterns so we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

70
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,260
for patterns and this is not nothing new

71
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,629
in computer science I mean you all know

72
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,179
or many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you probably know this book</font>

73
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:31,728
of the so-called gang of five gang of

74
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,120
four about design patterns in

75
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:37,639
object-oriented software designs so the

76
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,790
ideas you have a regularly occurring

77
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,409
problem and there is a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of agreed on</font>

78
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,388
best practice solution and you

79
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,280
documented that we document that in a

80
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,760
standardized way that's the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,560
design patterns and many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,500
come up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past with the idea to</font>

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">also identify privacy design patterns of</font>

84
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,220
Hiva see patterns that means best

85
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:04,370
practices how to protect privacy and in

86
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,290
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort with researchers from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

87
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,239
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> netherlands from germany and</font>

88
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,629
austria we are running this privacy

patterns EU portal where we collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

90
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:18,709
discuss about such piracy patterns and

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">why doing this we thought about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

92
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,460
that that's all what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for good but</font>

93
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:26,550
there should also be

94
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:32,400
a list of patterns of what people do to

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:37,139
violate privacy and we can we came upon

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,880
the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a dark pattern and if we</font>

97
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,400
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page where they</font>

98
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,780
discuss you I dark patterns dark

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,669
patterns in the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface that</font>

100
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,818
makes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things they don't want</font>

101
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:50,520
to do and actually they are within<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

102
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalog that you have one pattern it</font>

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:59,130
already relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to privacy and the</font>

104
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:05,039
question we ask is are there more such

105
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:11,389
privacy dark patterns and can we how can

106
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:13,740
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them and if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at patterns</font>

107
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,530
privacy patterns other patterns you

108
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,440
typically see that they happen on

109
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,448
different levels of abstractions in our

110
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,610
field I mean we have privacy enhancing

111
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,190
technologies which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which</font>

112
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,130
are something very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically applied</font>

113
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,650
to solve a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> the privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patterns</font>

114
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:35,180
are something kind of on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

115
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,948
that still solve a concrete problem and

116
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:43,620
yapping who basically came up with the

117
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:47,009
idea of like the mic is failing no it's

118
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay came up with the idea of privacy</font>

119
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,500
design strategies so strategies are more

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,919
abstract and patterns and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,229
cool patterns in two different

122
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,530
approaches how to protect privacy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

123
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,960
was our starting point from which we

124
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,130
then looked into the dark side of

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:11,870
privacy so in his paper yup Hank

126
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:15,810
basically presents a total of eight

127
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,969
strategies how to protect privacy and we

128
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:25,110
then said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there should be something</font>

129
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:28,770
similar to work against piracy and we

130
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,849
came up also with<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight dark strategies</font>

131
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,289
privacy dark strategies

132
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:38,110
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go if you saw this whole</font>

133
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:41,110
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're we often you find</font>

134
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,839
websites find apps that collect more

135
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,330
data than they should to fulfill their

136
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:51,779
purpose and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the maximized</font>

137
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:54,899
strategy often data that should be kept

138
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:58,919
protected because it's personal data is

139
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:04,449
lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> League or actively published and</font>

140
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:08,938
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> published strategy data may</font>

141
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:12,369
be collected data that is collected at

142
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:15,309
different entities may be centralized

143
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:19,659
and analyzed together and that's the

144
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:22,089
centralized strategy data that should be

145
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:25,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">used only in aggregated form</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

146
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,550
still retained in its individual as

147
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,219
individual data with individual

148
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,499
relationships for example still linking

149
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,899
two persons where the data should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> soo</font>

150
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:38,490
demised or analyzed so that's the

151
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-service strategy next we have</font>

152
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,229
obscure strategy where basically people

153
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,089
are not clearly explained what's going

154
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:52,930
to happen to their data that they submit

155
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:56,139
for example in a web form then we have

156
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,289
the deny strategy where people for

157
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,809
example are refused to have their

158
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:05,318
account deleted something that we know

159
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:10,779
from companies that since then have

160
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:13,240
changed their practice sometimes you

161
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:17,229
find situations where privacy policies

162
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,789
are actively violated so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

163
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,959
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a statement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

164
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:25,300
data would be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> X but in fact it</font>

165
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,449
would be used for why and what you also

166
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">find quite regularly are strategies that</font>

167
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:35,169
we go out is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy that we call</font>

168
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:37,569
fake so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically claim that they</font>

169
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,789
have proper privacy protection for

170
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:41,588
example there are these fake privacy

171
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,860
seals that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find in some web page</font>

172
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,990
that are completely meaningless but

173
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll make people believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

174
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,940
that their data is in good hands so they

175
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:54,140
will willingly fill in all kinds of

176
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,560
information so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are our eight</font>

177
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:01,459
privacy dark strategies and with this we

178
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,810
then started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to search for specific</font>

179
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,819
privacy dark patterns and the

180
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,209
methodology we applied was basically

181
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,910
looking at the top 50 apps in app stores

182
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:15,680
from google and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple and the Alexa top</font>

183
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,240
100 websites and looking at the apps

184
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,890
browsing through the web sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to</font>

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:27,089
find elements that would follow one or

186
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:31,589
more of these strategies and that's what

187
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:36,560
we then call privacy dark pattern and in

188
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:39,839
the paper we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a first set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

189
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,689
patterns that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> described starting from</font>

190
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,000
addressbook bleaching that defaults etc

191
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,890
privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> surveying actually is not our</font>

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,160
term but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this dark patterns</font>

193
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:52,829
web page so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the one piracy</font>

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,050
pattern they had and so on and for each

195
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:58,199
of these patterns we basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

196
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">standardized template to describe these</font>

197
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:04,199
patterns so we start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a name or</font>

198
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,689
alternative names<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the context in</font>

199
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:08,729
which this pattern happens on this

200
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,459
example here it's about invest book

201
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">leaching so users uploading their</font>

202
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:17,279
address book to some system provider

203
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,740
that made them<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse that for example to</font>

204
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,740
content to spam friends or ask friends

205
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,990
where they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join that service</font>

206
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,899
there's a detailed description<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to</font>

207
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,399
shorten here a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effect of</font>

208
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:35,820
the pattern in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect it violates</font>

209
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,310
privacy what countermeasures you can

210
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,940
take to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pattern from being</font>

211
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:45,510
successful examples and known uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

212
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,390
this pattern is applied related patterns

213
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,000
and i think one interesting aspect here

214
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,209
is we also discussed psychological

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,300
aspects why does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern work what</font>

216
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,550
makes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall prey to that pattern</font>

217
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,849
because that is very important thing to

218
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,069
understand to start and work against

219
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,399
that pattern and we categorize the

220
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:12,149
patterns by<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy so that you can</font>

221
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,630
also search for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> again this question</font>

222
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:21,029
why do patterns work is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

223
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:24,300
a quite interesting because I mean in

224
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:27,420
the end we believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of these</font>

225
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,760
companies actually actively think about

226
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,329
how they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make people who build data</font>

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,339
and I mean I'm speculating now but I

228
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:40,019
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even higher</font>

229
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:44,370
psychologists to help you in getting

230
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:46,649
people submit data or work use your

231
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,380
application using web site in your way

232
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:52,980
and one explanation that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussed in</font>

233
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,380
the paper is related to so-called system

234
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,290
to system one thinking which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

235
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,589
terminology that Daniel Kahneman came up

236
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,689
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bet Nobel Prize winner and the</font>

237
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,000
idea is that when you are in system to

238
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:10,140
mode you actively think and you make

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">rational decisions however in situations</font>

240
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,930
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in a hurry for example you</font>

241
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">may then switch to system won't thinking</font>

242
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,069
where you make intuitive decisions now

243
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,860
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the time to think</font>

244
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,740
something so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> let it decide okay i</font>

245
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,930
need to do online banking way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font>

246
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,279
use that service tripadvisor<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font>

247
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,660
find a restaurant to go tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

248
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,029
login is just in your way so you

249
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,390
intuitively search for the quickest way

250
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get around it the quickest way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

251
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,529
facebook login and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

252
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:48,149
the small print whether you what kind of

253
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:51,779
data you upload or not and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

254
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:54,300
explanation that also relates to many of

255
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:59,670
the patterns another explanation that we

256
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:04,229
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very often these sites</font>

257
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:07,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps active explicitly address</font>

258
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,499
basic motivational strategies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

259
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">will need to belong to a</font>

260
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:14,829
or they may hint that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> may miss</font>

261
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:16,839
something like here with tripadvisor

262
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:19,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah you're missing all the nice</font>

263
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,569
services we could give you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

264
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:27,609
an account good so we have started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

265
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:29,378
first collection of such patterns and we

266
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:32,019
now want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invite all of you to</font>

267
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:34,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically join us in this effort to find</font>

268
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,539
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> such dark patterns to discuss about</font>

269
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:41,949
such dark patterns and we have created<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

270
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:44,169
website dark privacy EU and basically

271
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:46,179
you can look at those patterns have

272
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:49,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer descriptions than what we could</font>

273
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:52,419
put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper but you can also add</font>

274
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,429
for example you can you can add more

275
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:56,499
patterns you can discuss patterns you

276
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:59,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">can vote on patterns which you like what</font>

277
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:03,759
you don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

278
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:07,929
own content you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login however we</font>

279
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:11,709
try to find the most unintrusive way for

280
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:13,299
you to basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> use our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website so it's</font>

281
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,069
basically chest you enter an email

282
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,720
address it could be even a one-time

283
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:19,569
email you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get email the password and</font>

284
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:26,039
that's everything and we don't store any

285
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:26,039
account data I promise you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
