18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,520
through those new wristbands it's

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,090
generally about collecting data about

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,309
yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then using that data to to</font>

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,289
infer some some information for example

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,360
measure your fitness your improvement

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:09,090
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can largely divided the</font>

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,260
data that you sample into these four

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,630
categories one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you reports that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,490

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,420
example how your fitness improves over

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,949
time there's data about multiple users

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,810
so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested in how you</font>

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,810
compare to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people in terms of</font>

31
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,150
fitness there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-dimensional data</font>

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,680
that you collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> about yourself so you</font>

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,780
might want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how your eating</font>

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,549
habits influence your fitness and then

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,079
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> research of course where you</font>

36
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,460
want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from large groups</font>

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,220
so the questions that we asked ourselves

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,960
were these<font color="#E5E5E5"> for how do qsr services and</font>

39
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,720
and privacy relate from a legal

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective so rather theoretical and</font>

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,270
then in practice what do the service

42
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">providers actually do from users</font>

43
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,770
perspective so what did the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

44
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:06,420
of this and then again<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,989
technology perspective so for this paper

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,819
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on the data that was already</font>

47
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,530
collected and then sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the service</font>

48
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,390
provider so we didn't look at the

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,010
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the connection between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

50
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,329
wristband and your smartphone or<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

51
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the smartphone and the service provider</font>

52
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,200
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also look we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

53
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,730
data once it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sent to the</font>

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,679
service provider what do they do with it

55
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,790
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they handle their to how do they</font>

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,500
process it there as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal</font>

57
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,540
situation there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,620
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at one is the currently in</font>

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,709
force European data protection directive

60
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,319
which is not directly applicable but it

61
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,550
was translated transposed international

62
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,619
law by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> member states it the general</font>

63
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,620
idea is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if you collect data</font>

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,360
and you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> process it then in its</font>

65
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,530
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> data this is only allowed under</font>

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,150
certain conditions and it's applicable

67
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,780
to all data that is being processed

68
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,300
within the EU and then the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

69
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of law is the GDP are</font>

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,650
which I guess most of you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,989
about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is applicable in from 2018</font>

72
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,600
and the core principles are largely

73
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,360
unchanged so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that personal data</font>

74
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,700
is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to be processed under</font>

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,780
certain conditions that stays the same

76
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,280
but there are some terms that change and

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,570
then the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpretation of those</font>

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms is a little unclear because</font>

79
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,900
there's no court rulings that have

80
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,780
clarified the meaning of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

81
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,730
it's applicable to all offerings of

82
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,110
services or goods within the EU so even

83
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,929
if you have a company that's based in

84
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,850
the US and they offer a service in the

85
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,760
EU then they still have to abide<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

86
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,620
those rules there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are significant fines</font>

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,010
for violations so it goes up to four

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,260
percent of the annual turnover of a

89
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:00,358
company and that would even hurt giants

90
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:03,090
like Facebook or or Google so no matter

91
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,489
what of the those two you look at the

92
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,840
data processing for service provision so

93
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,209
if I provide a service for you of course

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,989
I have to process your data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

95
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:16,079
not usually a problem when it comes to

96
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,989
health data then it's a little more

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,459
restrictive but still if I provide a

98
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,609
service for you obviously I have to

99
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,010
process your data and if you give me

100
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,180
your consent then it's usually no

101
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,060
problem at all and

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,580
we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the rule that</font>

103
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">applies to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the QSR service</font>

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:40,320
providers however then the next problem

105
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,630
is what is what I health data at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and</font>

106
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,070
what's the clear definition for example

107
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,919
if I take my pulse obviously thats

108
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,960
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my health but if somebody</font>

109
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,710
collects location profiles and sees that

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never run at speeds faster than 3 kph</font>

111
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,770
then that might be related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my health</font>

112
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,509
as well so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little unclear data</font>

113
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">related to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third parties that I collect</font>

114
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:06,720
is is a problem anyway and yeah data

115
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,570
processing for other purposes then the

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I previously signed up for is</font>

117
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,110
usually problematic so it's not not

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,440
generally allowed there are some

119
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,970
exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it's yeah related to</font>

120
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,880
the original purpose or not incompatible

121
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,090
with it then this is allowed but this is

122
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,009
by far not a carte blanche for for the

123
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:30,630
service providers to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

124
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:32,130
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> incompatible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

125
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">GDP are there's an explicit research</font>

126
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,930
exception so data for research is

127
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,220
allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be processed and anonymous</font>

128
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:43,770
data is also rather unproblematic

129
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,780
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> even lawyers know now that if</font>

130
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,960
you strip the name of a data set that

131
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,799
data is not necessarily anonymous at

132
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,799
that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not not that easy for</font>

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,360
their service providers so we looked at

134
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:03,139
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice how do service providers</font>

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,310
handle the data that you give them and

136
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,400
there are some some things that are

137
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,409
rather intuitive for example most of the

138
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,190
service providers install their data

139
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:16,710
exclusively<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the cloud although you</font>

140
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,320
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that for some of their</font>

141
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,888
calculations it it's not really

142
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,219
necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store the data in the cloud</font>

143
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:28,229
but then most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> services finance</font>

144
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,090
themselves by doing advertisements or

145
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:34,500
doing personalized advertisements that

146
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:38,669
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is rather common as well if you</font>

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,070
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the the column next to the</font>

148
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,750
direct advertisement then you see that

149
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,510
some service providers explicitly state

150
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,730
that in their privacy policies some only

151
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">say okay we may contact you with</font>

152
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:54,270
relevant information about our services

153
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,540
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can interpret</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as advertisement</font>

154
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,430
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also found some very</font>

155
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,530
peculiar things in the privacy policies

156
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,150
for example if you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

157
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:09,390
last red circle some service providers

158
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,120
say okay we may change<font color="#CCCCCC"> these privacy</font>

159
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:15,270
policies from time to time and you have

160
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,760
to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> our website to to be noticed of</font>

161
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,750
the to notice these changes and I guess

162
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,310
everyone who's read the hitchhiker's

163
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,070
guide to the galaxy knows why this

164
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,200
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 0 will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if</font>

165
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,380
the service provider just changes their

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,539
privacy policy saying OK from today I

167
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,940
may sell your data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the highest bidder</font>

168
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,120
and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had three hours to check my</font>

169
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,130
website so i did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you want me</font>

170
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,480
if you want to sue me now then it's your

171
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,159
problem you had time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> check it so this</font>

172
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem and then we had</font>

173
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,840
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things which you can see but</font>

174
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,780
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to refer you to</font>

175
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,280
the paper and yeah then we also did a

176
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,260
survey which will be presented by yeah

177
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,169
so next thing we were interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in was</font>

178
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,630
the user perspective once again we have

179
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,720
a lot more results in the paper and on

180
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,940
our hard drives but some striking

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,760
results first of all we asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

182
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:15,120
sensitive users consider certain kinds

183
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,510
of data or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case all response of</font>

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,120
our survey which was among about 400

185
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:24,140
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the UK so we were just in time</font>

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,380
for the EU perspective to cover the UK

187
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:30,960
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was how sensitive the</font>

188
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,150
data were considered and I was quite

189
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,949
astonished at financial assets financial

190
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,490
transactions these data were considered

191
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,760
very sensitive by a large percentage of

192
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,700
people health data were below that which

193
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,520
I didn't expect and also data<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Wade</font>

194
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,580
or muscle mass which are related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

195
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,710
health but are not usually called health

196
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,810
data which people don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as</font>

197
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,300
health data<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not considered very</font>

198
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,880
sensitive so some quite interesting

199
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,790
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> there next thing we wanted to</font>

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">know is what do they think could happen</font>

201
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,920
with the data and are they willing to do

202
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:13,380
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> against it first thing we</font>

203
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:16,589
asked was are people willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay to</font>

204
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,320
prevent data transfers and also are they

205
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,850
even worried about data transferred so

206
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,190
concerning the bar is about data

207
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,770
transfers<font color="#CCCCCC"> every quarters were worried</font>

208
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,080
about transfer of health data<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

209
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">their real identity and then I found it</font>

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite remarkable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that even under a</font>

211
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,330
random pseudonym they about half of the

212
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,150
people would still consider that an

213
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,339
issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously aware that</font>

214
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,709
taking pseudonyms is not real

215
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,630
anonymization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that quite</font>

216
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,970
positive so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's even known</font>

217
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,060
outside our community that pseudonyms

218
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:55,170
aren't sufficient necessarily when it

219
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,900
comes to paying for privacy well at

220
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,699
least a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 percent said they would pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

221
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-off fee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't specify the height</font>

222
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,830
of the fee what forty percent would pay

223
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,069
a one-off fee to prevent data transfers

224
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,620
of health data twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> one percent would</font>

225
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">even be willing to pay a monthly fee so</font>

226
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,339
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we don't know how I did that</font>

227
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:19,260
feel could be more or less funny result

228
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,180
concerning reading privacy policies

229
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,810
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can interpret in two different</font>

230
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,260
ways we ask potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> users so people</font>

231
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,390
who don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> qsr services would you</font>

232
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,740
read the privacy policies prior to

233
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:37,439
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a service and many of</font>

234
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,110
them said yes I would and when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

235
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,810
people actually use the services many

236
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,240
said no but a large percentage will

237
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,520
refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give an answer so that's what</font>

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see down there that's people who use</font>

239
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,779
the services who refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer if</font>

240
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,599
they read the privacy policies there are

241
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,439
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to interpret that another</font>

242
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,209
example for a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's would you</font>

243
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,160
use a quantified self service that

244
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:05,310
finances itself by transferring your

245
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,469
data to third parties eighty-five

246
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,469
percent said no nine percent said yes

247
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:16,069
obviously we did the study of the

248
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:19,519
privacy policies and we asked users so

249
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:25,819
what's more obvious than combining those

250
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:27,920
two so do people expect that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

251
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:30,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">here these different service providers</font>

252
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,740
use the data for personalized

253
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,680
advertisement so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we had 32</font>

254
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,420
users of fantastic in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that survey</font>

255
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-thirds of them said we don't expect</font>

256
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,250
personalized advertisement and also

257
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,199
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds said if fantastic was</font>

258
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,089
using my data for personalized

259
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:49,969
advertisement we would stop using that

260
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,910
service which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite remarkable</font>

261
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,940
because runtastic does that at least

262
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,189
they stated in the privacy policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

263
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,970
now coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the user perspective to</font>

264
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:04,699
the pet perspective and that obviously

265
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,160
we can't give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the solutions for</font>

266
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:10,339
privacy in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> qsr so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

267
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,699
overview of possible research issues we

268
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,279
see there the first one are going from

269
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,560
one to multiple users like you want

270
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">competition Alice wants to compare her</font>

271
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,209
running speed to Bob well there is a

272
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,149
simple solution in a simple setting

273
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:30,500
that's y'all's millionaire problem and a

274
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:32,569
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions for that but for</font>

275
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,360
example if you want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much did</font>

276
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,920
Alice improve in comparison to Bob then

277
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,439
it gets more difficult and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think</font>

278
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,060
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> further examples in that direction if</font>

279
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:42,769
you have multi-dimensional data

280
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,130
especially if it's also bought multiple

281
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,779
users you have to look can the goals of

282
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,360
my application still be achieved if i

283
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:55,910
use fuzzy or aggregated data that's

284
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,130
aggregation of data help you kinda like

285
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,769
aggregation for a one dimensional data

286
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,540
of course you can do it several times

287
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:05,870
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each dimension but if you want to</font>

288
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the relation between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this data</font>

289
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,800
then it gets obviously difficult that's

290
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,719
application dependent then next general

291
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,410
require thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time series</font>

292
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,080
data so if you have data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from different</font>

293
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:25,160
periods can you make them unlink

294
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:29,270
so you have two persons one has a pulse

295
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,760
of 60 in the first period and the other

296
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,050
has a pulse of 140 and you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

297
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,330
the second period<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is one with a</font>

298
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,750
pulse of 65 and one with powers of

299
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:42,170
hundred thirty can you map them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

300
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,730
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no obvious solution for that it</font>

301
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,620
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult if you want to use</font>

302
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,810
data for research so you don't know the

303
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:53,360
analysis goal beforehand you are looking

304
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:55,790
for unknown correlations and can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

305
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,490
that with anonymous data obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

306
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,620
very simple we as an interdisciplinary

307
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,360
working group are especially interested

308
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,760
in the intersection<font color="#CCCCCC"> between legal and</font>

309
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,070
technical issues so our data

310
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,160
sufficiently<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymized from the</font>

311
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,810
perspective of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gdp are and that's</font>

312
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,480
something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do also</font>

313
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,089
in collaboration with other researchers

314
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">so to conclude arm we have a lot of data</font>

315
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:22,370
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> considered very sensitive</font>

316
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,150
especially by the law as they include

317
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,920
health data but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

318
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,890
healthy tar from the legal perspective

319
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,660
so we have to find the clear delineation

320
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,730
when its data coming from a hospital it

321
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,219
seems quite clear but we heard the

322
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,920
question yesterday what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about my Fitbit</font>

323
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,960
data or stuff like that users might not

324
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,610
always be aware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequences and</font>

325
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,960
even if they are even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they state</font>

326
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,150
their preferences we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

327
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,570
privacy they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always act</font>

328
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:52,400
accordingly and we saw that we also saw

329
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,740
saw that there is a mismatch between the

330
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">user expectations and the actual</font>

331
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,150
policies of the service providers that

332
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,060
ran tastic example for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

333
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,980
personalized advertisement so to

334
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,079
conclude we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one solution</font>

335
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,090
but we have a lot of work to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,610
upcoming pets and we hope to come back

337
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,640
in the next few years with some more

338
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,170
solutions from the technical perspective

339
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,170
thanks for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention thank you</font>
