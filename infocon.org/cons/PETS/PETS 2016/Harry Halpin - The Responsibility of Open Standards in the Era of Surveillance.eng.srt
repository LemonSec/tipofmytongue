5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,750
everyone's had a good meal so we'll try

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,090
to keep everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> awake this is the as</font>

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,160
you digest this is talk is about the

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility of open standards in the</font>

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,200
stat your hand if you have been

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,750
traumatized by working what the

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,300
standards body<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,519
that's the majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font>

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to kind of talk about this I hope</font>

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,600
we have lots of questions so one

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,710
question is what is an open standard and

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,440
all peoples a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards</font>

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,359
bodies or you know what why do you even

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,830
need it well I think to understand why

25
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">opens and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is important it's it's more to</font>

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,470
understand what open actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> means so</font>

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,850
has quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few different definitions</font>

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,950
but you have to remember it's open

29
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,419
standards are in contrast to close

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,580
standard so how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here have</font>

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,130
ever had to do very<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel</font>

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,750
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then you have to</font>

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have to like pay to</font>

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,860
download the sequel spec and you go to

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,340
bittorrent you're looking for a sequel

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,909
spec and no one seating the sequel specs

37
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,630
so so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens is that</font>

38
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,850
traditionally believe it or not

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,798
standards happen in closed environments

40
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,229
with voting and nation states and it was

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,990
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little input or input from</font>

42
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,899
engineers you may not been the best and

43
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,579
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and the web after</font>

44
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,189
that said well we should have open

45
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,979
standards as an open collab repressed we

46
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,169
should get wide review from the planet

47
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,060
and the one thing as standards actually

48
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,430
do quite well I think it's inarguable is

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,009
we give names and numbers the things

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,689
that everyone's already doing so you

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,280
know I want to H Mac what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

52
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,429
mean how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing it well there's a</font>

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,140
speck has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number you can read you know</font>

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,080
if it's well-written understand what's

55
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,309
going on we ideally oh they'll

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,770
it's hit and miss provide

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,960
interoperability testing so if someone

58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,120
implants us back at Euclid a spec they

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,200
should interoperate and then there's a

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,330
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of legal stuff which we're also</font>

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,280
going to touch on you know open

62
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,620
standards present prevent companies from

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,810
being accused of antitrust and they have

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,490
depending on the standards body some

65
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,550
amount of patent protections that's what

66
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,660
an open standard is it is also

67
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,840
exceptionally slow and painful<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

68
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,299
and so there's this great blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post I</font>

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,580
how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

70
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,250
actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> well everyone should read</font>

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,230
this blog post by none other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moxie</font>

72
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,760
Marlinspike of the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> whisper signal</font>

73
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,700
team and he's a very interesting

74
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,280
argument old friend he basically argues

75
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,850
the ecosystems moving and that at this

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,520
point open standards actually hurt or

77
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,230
could hurt deployment it is actually

78
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">very convincing argument and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

79
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,570
it's worth taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously you know</font>

80
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,790
does extensibility hurt deployment you

81
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,430
can't control what's on the other end

82
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,040
point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> xmpp is the sort of classic</font>

83
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,400
case of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deployment of OTR is a</font>

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,500
classic cases inside XMPP one that clear

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,060
advantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> of something like XMPP if you</font>

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,180
go back to dance talk its discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

90
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,049
jabbered<font color="#CCCCCC"> ccee talk to Jabbar org but you</font>

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,239
know the question is as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

92
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,790
centralizes more and more as more people

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,530
are essentially inside proprietary

94
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,790
platforms is the centralization even a

95
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,590
realistic strategy at this point and

96
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,940
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already got the</font>

97
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,560
decentralization we need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

98
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone has a mobile phone they have</font>

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,530
address books they can move them between

100
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,540
androids and and you know different

101
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,280
devices maybe that's the portable social

102
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,730
graph that we've all been hoping what

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,040
happen another you know biting criticism

104
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,380
is that open standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> slowdown</font>

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,480
innovation right so you know if you're

106
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,630
stuck in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mailing list talking for</font>

107
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,609
three years before you implement the

108
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,620
world may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved and now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in a</font>

109
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,450
period<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean the apt space where</font>

110
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,760
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of really fast innovation</font>

111
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,919
and second thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there was a</font>

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,710
theory and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still it's true I think</font>

113
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,549
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where you are and what who</font>

114
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,099
you're deploying to

115
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,960
you that you if you want to reach users

116
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,659
I mean maybe standards the way to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,888
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go through a web browser</font>

118
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:36,659
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're Brendan I you like I'll</font>

119
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,550
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a new web browser or fork one</font>

120
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,590
if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in existing web</font>

121
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,509
browsers you have to go through open

122
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,388
standards but that may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

123
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:48,030
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have certain market sectors you</font>

124
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,979
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail for email whatsapp for</font>

125
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,559
example messaging then maybe it makes

126
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,710
more sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> just them deploy the protocol</font>

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,360
at the key points where there's already

128
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:02,520
millions if not and what's that's case

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,229
in gmail billions of users so we're

130
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to i'm going to i think all those</font>

131
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:09,930
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> are serious and they are true to</font>

132
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,650
an extent by thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a case to be</font>

133
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,120
made for defending and working on open

134
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,310
standards and by the end of this talk

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,229
we're going to try to get to the point

136
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,969
of not only do we know when we should

137
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,050
work on a standard but we can also

138
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:26,879
explain when your technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

140
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,779
whatever you're working on is ready for

141
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">standardization so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

142
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,370
engineering task force is the sort

understand what that actually would mean

you can see there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sort of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ten if not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more a year gap between most</font>

today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the standards themselves</font>

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,490
that's how interesting look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> timing</font>

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't share it so therefore we</font>

197
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,570
all got unencrypted protocols that we

198
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,590
didn't had to spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time fixing</font>

199
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,240
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a bit so as you can see</font>

200
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,479
you know Vint that's otherwise those the

201

architect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people have been</font>

202
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,510
working a very long time trying to crip

203
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,970
the net I think post-snowden there's

204
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,770
been some victory so the other standards

205
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,820
body or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a fork to some extent</font>

206
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,320
of IETF is w3c w3c deals with the web

207
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,620
standards directed by tim berners-lee

and venture of the web and that some of

209
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,930
the advantages of w3c over let's say ITF

210
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people complain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i champ is a</font>

211
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,940
very fuzzy process it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unclear really</font>

212
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,790
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what you go there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no timing</font>

213
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,190
things get stuck there for years w3c

214
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,870
actually when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes a new standard</font>

215
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,669
says we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will deliver standard with the</font>

216
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,430
next year's or we kill the working group

217
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,719
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a good thing it has if you</font>

218
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,760
think the working groups doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> some that</font>

219
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,460
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like there's a formal</font>

220
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,830
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> for formally objecting it uses</font>

221
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,010
github now at least that's great you

222
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,770
know really increasing the productivity

223
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,659
w3c has interoperability requirements so

224
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,210
standards which have normative parts

225
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,760
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope your standard does has to</font>

226
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,900
prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have more than one</font>

227
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,500
implementation of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications are</font>

228
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,089
interoperable via test suite of course

229
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,740
while it is focus on web browsers you

230
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,400
know and we've done I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a fair</font>

amount of decency

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,790
charity work which<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go into the bit</font>

233
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,500
you know there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

234
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,439
confusions there's also what we G so a

235
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,720
certain point w3c rather unfortunately

236
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,790
thought XML is the future of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web and</font>

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web browser windows went off and did</font>

if you haven't seen one this by the most

exciting one we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

everyone hates passwords and at some

point a web authentication which comes

you know things standards can happen

265
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,480
fast they can't happen quick this comes

267
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,340
there's still concerns for example on

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">this bet there's a concern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe</font>

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,960
the users credentials cryptographically

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,300
fine but however let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to see</font>

271
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,940
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you using a you bikini or are you</font>

272
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,040
using a certain kind of biometric how

273
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,750
the there's another bit of spec that's

274
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,270
about testing the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of device you</font>

275
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,930
have so if everyone's device has a

276
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,449
unique ID it is essentially defeats all

277
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the privacy considerations for the sort</font>

278
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:43,100
of user base key material right so there

279
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,660
there's it needs more we need privacy

280
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,100
researchers looking at our specs and

281
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,589
it's becoming more popular to publish

282
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,250
papers on them patents are very

283
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:55,430
different between IETF and w3c ITF has a

284
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,990
note well process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

285

disclose packets if you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

286
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">but then occasionally this leads to</font>

287
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,899
email this for people are claiming they

can't read emails

289
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,839
you know it gets really weird really

they put forward a petition to basically

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,430
that you read the w3c's response and

the process is slow and you know we
