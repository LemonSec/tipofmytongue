1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:08,420
and we are from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the University of</font>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,759
Minnesota so let's first give you guys

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,250
overview about our system so our menu

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,160
system is the anti-censorship system

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,160
which can provide the social networking

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to the user in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the number in the</font>

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensory region so our right now our work</font>

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:34,980
is public and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can download as a code</font>

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:38,969
from the github link so let's talk about

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,339
is the relative works there are two two

11
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,940
papers talking about censorship design

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,550
the common pitfalls when designing the

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,449

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,449
a genuine system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:14,000
to detect the system the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is the</font>

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,530
encapsulates the network layer traffic

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,969
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the emails and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emails are sent</font>

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,280
from the user to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxies and they</font>

36
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:08,699
change this information by using emails

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,370
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the proxy gathers info make a</font>

38
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,410
linear equation it will recover the

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,210
network not

40
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">or layer traffic in the doing so so the</font>

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,210
first property<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suite it has no</font>

42
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:26,000
imitation flaw because so it uses the

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,910
email channels directly so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,180
imitation this is a good point the

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:35,840
second point however the suite is not

46
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,940
content consistent it<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the email</font>

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,490
channels to transmit network layer

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,570
traffic this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a continent</font>

49
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:48,770
consistent this this property enables

50
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:52,190
the sensor to detect the suede service

51
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,030
for example for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> waist connection it</font>

52
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,980
starts multiple it needs the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:01,640
exchanges between the users and the

54
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,570
proxies many emails the typical number

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,089
is 8 so a connection need eight emails

56
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,120
the sensor can know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it blocks</font>

57
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,810
that in another problem without the

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">waiting's it is not a channel consistent</font>

59
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,870
so for the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> service it can tolerant</font>

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,290
a certain kind of delays but if the

61
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:27,200
suede are you using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mount delay</font>

62
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:31,630
tolerant protocols such delay can be

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,619
used by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor too disruptive system</font>

64
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:41,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet email</font>

65
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:44,300
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the emails to send a</font>

66
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,459
trace to the to the Twitter websites but

67
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,239
follow tweet email it's not designed for

68
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,660
the anti-censorship purpose so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

69
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,820
blocked in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second problem valid</font>

70
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,579
email is you have to trust to treat

71
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,940
email if it it is not sure it's

72
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,470
malicious they can post any messages on

73
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:09,680
behalf of you so that's another problem

74
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,859
so the the third category are the

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,489
relative work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't talk about is our</font>

76
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,919
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> facet design it two years ago the</font>

77
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:22,219
fastest system can provide the video

78
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:25,760
watching like<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and in the vimeo</font>

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,480
in real time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the central rip user</font>

80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,690
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this system worked in this way you</font>

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,840
send for the user it ascends the video

82
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,180
URL to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the proxy after</font>

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,969
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> this message it will start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

84
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,820
skype video conversation with you so you

85
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,710
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a video company request and</font>

86
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,190
you can watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole video from the</font>

87
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,130
skype session so the basic idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

88
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,600
facet is is try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve most</font>

89
00:04:52,130 --> 00:05:00,409
circumvention needs by a small set of

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,180
unobservable transports so there are it

91
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:11,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">is reported that there are three</font>

92
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:16,400
categories of needs the first name so

93
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,710
the so the first nate is uncensored the

94
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">video watching and a second-rate second</font>

95
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,609
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the uncensored search engine and</font>

96
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the third one is a social networking so</font>

97
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,770
we continue our work and then make it

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:36,830
the next important step try to provide

99
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:40,490
the social networking to the user this

100
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">outward design goes first unblockable we</font>

101
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,310
won our system not to immune mutate

102
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:50,450
other protocols and also we try to make

103
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,190
our system consistent and also we

104
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,380
require our system to be real-time

105
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,350
service we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want the user to wait</font>

106
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,290
so long time the third credential

107
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,710
security we don't want to post security

108
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,040
stress to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about his</font>

109
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,530
social networking accounts the sir the

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,480
force is the low service overhead we

111
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,330
want our surveys very efficient so we

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:18,710
can support many users in the same time

113
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the last one is a sighted good side</font>

114
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,549
benefit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our system we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need the</font>

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:29,599
client sign implementation this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tak</font>

116
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,670
model we assume in this work so we first

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,820
ways to assume the sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker</font>

118
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:37,580
there's no fancy here in a way also we

119
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,750
consider our own mainly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve it</font>

120
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,260
servers

121
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,870
are not are not a trusted so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

122
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:50,180
very strong assumption because we want

123
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:52,010
our bellies user to be to be very secure

124
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:56,990
to you our system so we make it a strong

125
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:59,450
assumption so we consider two problems

126
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,990
why it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credenza privacy so no</font>

127
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:06,800
mainly server should know the credential

128
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the of the user in a second a second</font>

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,530
why is the interaction integrity we

130
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow a single male a server to</font>

131
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:22,119
change the outcomes of the action or

132
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:25,450
action itself so it comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

133
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,250
mailing system design this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

134
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:34,070
illustration how the user can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use our</font>

135
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:38,600
system so the user what if the user

136
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:42,020
wants to post a tweet like past 16 it

137
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,300
will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay many servers posted this</font>

138
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">message for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and there are many</font>

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers receiving this email and it will</font>

140
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,719
talk to the Twitter's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay unze user</font>

141
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> police post in this message for</font>

142
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:01,070
me in the finally the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter agaves</font>

143
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:04,820
message in the post to that message for

144
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,849
the for the user so we adjust three

145
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,000
challenges the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge is</font>

146
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:14,060
consistency in our email we don't

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,520
encapsulate the network traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

148
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,180
to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the messages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we won't post</font>

149
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,840
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDS of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the retrace we write it</font>

150
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">down in the email directly in the second</font>

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,590
one we can protect our credential

152
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:33,610
privacy no single belly in server knows

153
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,429
the credential this seems country

154
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,919
controversy because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainly server</font>

155
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:42,620
needs the Prudential to finish finish

156
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,040
the service because it has to prove to

157
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:50,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger that is the user but in the</font>

158
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,459
same time this user are not allowed to

159
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the credential</font>

160
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,560
and we will address this problem in our

161
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:03,660
you later in the third challenge we try

162
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:07,349
to guarantee their interaction integrity

163
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:13,719
no mail a server can do malicious things

164
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:18,160
here here we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a demo</font>

165
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,860
power system works so<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuller for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main latest surveys directly</font>

168
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,620
without installing at a client software

169
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,940
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very convenient for the user so</font>

170
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,820
the ways right right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the email</font>

171
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,720
address of our many surveys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thus</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ended random emails to the our mailing</font>

173
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,380
service and later it will receive a

174
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:52,960
reply with the attachment which is the

175
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:55,600
HTML and the user and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user can open</font>

00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,290
this HTML attachment in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser and</font>

177
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,570
the input<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> username</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Twitter in</font>

178
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,360
our case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a to Twitter as example</font>

179
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:10,360
username password and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clinic is</font>

180
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:13,170
played so we split<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password into two</font>

181
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:20,290
parts and the send each part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

182
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:23,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">password to different many servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ins</font>

183
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so no single male a server can know</font>

184
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:31,170
the actual credential here is the

185
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,840
example how to post a trade the user can

186
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,060
can click the post in the email which is

187
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">a phoneme know from the previous one and</font>

188
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:45,910
you can write down the message post then

189
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,260
it will see this is a example double

190
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,430
check whether this message are

191
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:56,050
successfully posted the next one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

192
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:59,800
example how to retweet so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk</font>

193
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:03,370
about the decentralized<font color="#E5E5E5"> credential what</font>

194
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,689
so we split is a credential and the

195
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,380
problem is how we combine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prudential</font>

196
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,930
together this is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

197
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,990
adopted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Interceptor initiator</font>

198
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,020
architecture so the initiator starts a

199
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,850
connection as zero to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the teacher but as</font>

200
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,220
this traffic is related<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

201
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Interceptor the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Interceptor will find in</font>

202
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,780
the application data which includes a

203
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,710
half the part of the credential and then

204
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,780
release h ave stopped out there and try

205
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,250
to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure accommodation with the</font>

206
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:39,050
initiator to recover<font color="#CCCCCC"> the credential so</font>

207
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,210
here it comes to a problem how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

208
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,400
that secure computation a standard way

209
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:48,380
to do this is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a to a particle tation</font>

210
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:50,449
but we find that it's very custody it

211
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:57,860
takes six seconds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish a single</font>

212
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:59,720
rivest and they also 6mb<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen wives so we</font>

213
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,190
try to find another<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

214
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:07,160
GCM based solution we we adopt the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

215
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,290
benefits of the GCM from the encryption

216
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,150
it's a stream cipher basically and also

217
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">its authentication tag it's an</font>

218
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,790
encryption than<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac so we can able to</font>

219
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:21,680
split this<font color="#E5E5E5"> computation into two parts</font>

220
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:23,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the initiator takes fixed</font>

221
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,479
part of the encryption and is

222
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,750
interceptor takes part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication tag and we can X or</font>

224
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,220
recover in plain sight vertex to using

225
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:40,579
because it's a stream cipher in the then

226
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:44,630
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Interceptor it can recover to</font>

227
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:50,780
generate a valid tag with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the health of</font>

228
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:55,370
the of the user so our system can

229
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:57,800
achieve 120 speed up from the

230
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,520
traditional two-party computation and we

231
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,339
can see here sorry I'm around pan and

232
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:09,350
that all comes to the most important

233
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:13,190
part so so you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our system</font>

234
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:19,160
can can be finished a much earlier time

235
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:23,120
about below point point point there

236
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,189
seconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also our the fellows server</font>

237
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,009
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish the service in just</font>

238
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,350
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 seconds and we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

239
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:33,860
comparison with the traditional Twitter

240
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,379
API it also finished in 1 seconds so

241
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,399
where our service is quite an efficient

242
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:42,920
in the way we can support up to 200

243
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,589
simulated simultaneous fashions about

244
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,709
what and each request can be finished in

245
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:51,829
one second so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a comparison waste</font>

246
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:55,459
our others<font color="#E5E5E5"> are assistant you can if you</font>

247
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:57,430
are interested you can rate the paper so

248
00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:00,109
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conclusion we propose the</font>

249
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,079
anti-censorship system and you can send

250
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,170
the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> send as a trace for through</font>

251
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:10,089
the emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't have to trust</font>

252
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,089
our many service thank you
