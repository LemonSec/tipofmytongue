privacy on mobile devices last year at

the World Economic Forum you know

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,559
there's a ton of other quotes like this

23
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,349
but no privacy as we know it is no

24
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,940
longer feasible it's dead right privacy

25
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,629
is dead and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the recent</font>

there's this constant play between<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

use our GPS system to get around Germany

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,000

when we're exercising but they shouldn't

or that we have some medical condition

48
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,659
and then we store personal financial

49
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,189
data and then cameras right with all the

50
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,270
obviously privates implications you

51
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,729
could turn the camera on<font color="#CCCCCC"> when people</font>

52
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,949
aren't aware of it however it seems like

53
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,000
the users of these devices really want

54
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,560
privacy right 57 presents in 2012 when

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,270
they were surveyed said that they

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,909
avoided applications due to privacy

57
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,470
concerns eighty-seven percent of users

58
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,689
last year's said that they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

59
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,340
in control<font color="#E5E5E5"> their data and unsurprisingly</font>

60
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,630
most cell phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> users don't want people</font>

61
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,890
watching them when they're not allowed

62
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,298
I'm not sure what the other seven

63
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,149
percent we're thinking but apparently

64
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,409
they're a little more voyeuristic and in

65
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,030
fact a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of top companies are actually</font>

even promoting their privacy enhancing

67
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,140
technologies now you'll see Google and

68
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,380
Apple actually tote these things right

69
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font>

70
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,890
specially in the FBI case that was just

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,470
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Apple really use this as</font>

72
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,380
a marketing tactic so what we wanted to

73
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,020
do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our sok is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a step</font>

74
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,700
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the entire stack on</font>

75
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,080
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices right it's not just</font>

76
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,119
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just hardware it's not</font>

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,250
just user interaction a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times at</font>

78
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conferences you know we'll see</font>

79
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,940
specific papers that have specific

80
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,470
technologies but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

81
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,170
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all together and see you know</font>

82
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,210
why fundamentally is or is this not

83
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,769
working and an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> observation</font>

84
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,920
you know sort when you look at the

85
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,740
privacy stack is that the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

86
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,450
visible it is to the user the less data

87
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,520
it actually has access to so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort</font>

88
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of inversely proportional once you get</font>

89
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">down to the hardware level in these</font>

90
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,200
firmwares they actually can access

91
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,910
everything on your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as an end</font>

92
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,179
user you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> very low visibility into</font>

93
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,280
that so our hypothesis was that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

94
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the privacy leaks are coming sort of</font>

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,720
from this weird interactions at

96
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,340
different layers of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack so to go</font>

97
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,750
through that our methodology we first

98
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just look what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

99
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,710
technologies are actually out there on

100
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,270
real phones today right what is Apple

101
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,800
and Google and Microsoft and these type

102
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,990
of companies actually pushing out to

103
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,210
users and evaluate them right are they

104
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,970
working you know do they have pros and

105
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,290
cons after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look this</font>

106
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,210
is the stack portion we look at the

107
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,739
interactions between all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

108
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,660
all the technologies that are deployed

109
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,730
how they actually interact can one

110
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,160
undermine another where's the power lay

111
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,750
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we're going to look at</font>

112
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,490
the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are involved in and own</font>

113
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,990
these components<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the chips that you</font>

114
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,730
put in your phone and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are their</font>

115
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,620
potential motives right do they actually

116
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,209
care about user privacy are they going

117
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,490
to willingly share your data after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

118
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,720
give it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and hopefully at the end</font>

119
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we wanted to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

120
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,550
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> worldview so that as a community</font>

121
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,860
we can sort of agree on you know here's

122
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,360
the state where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and find try to</font>

123
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,620
find some nice directions on where we

124
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should go in the future to</font>

125
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,470
really you know hopefully revive privacy

126
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,150
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll go through the</font>

127
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,310
stack sort of one at a time we picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

128
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,020
picked a couple interesting things from

129
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,880
the paper there's obviously a lot more

130
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,109
breath in the s<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

131
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,690
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty-four</font>

132
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">references so a lot of good stuff that I</font>

133
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,130
read so we'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the user level</font>

134
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,500
there's really two main things that we

135
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,180
saw the user is presented with there's

136
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,190
the privacy policies that ever

137
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,690
the app for every website presents how

138
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,330
they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your data and then</font>

139
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,219
the user prompts the privacy policies we

140
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,050
didn't see much previous work in there

141
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,639
but we were just curious you know how

142
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,380
readable are these that people have a

143
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,539
clue what's going on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> patha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sis was</font>

144
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,330
that they don't so we actually

145
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:47,699

the flesh Kincaid algorithm but it

149
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,080
essentially tells you what level

150
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,389
education you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

151
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,698
the words written and it turns out that

152
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,199
only thirty to thirty two percent are

153
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,240

155
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,690
companies are pushing privacy policies

156
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,698
out there almost you know intentionally

157
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,699
encoded in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know where your data is being used the</font>

user prompts that are presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> to users</font>

160
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,520
I think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no surprise to anybody</font>

161
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,740
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference you know most of the</font>

162
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,539
the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> work shows that users</font>

163
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,789
either don't pay attention just<font color="#E5E5E5"> click</font>

164
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,440
yes to everything and as a result most

165
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:27,389
of the apps are very over provisioned

166
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,820
you can just request access to you know

167
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,039
location contacts pokemon gold for

168
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,389
example your entire Google account of

169
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,060
people to say yes you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

170
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,530
catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pikachu and then finally a lot of</font>

171
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,240
users don't even understand what's

172
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,638
happening on these apps like when I give

173
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,650
my location what does that even mean

174
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,070
right it just the message really is not

175
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting across very well moving down to</font>

176

<font color="#E5E5E5">the a player these are the were things</font>

177
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,729
like encryption and permissions models

178
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,560
come in so ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the apps</font>

179
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,110
are actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle your data</font>

180
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,539
responsibly to look at the encryption

181
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,120
problem we take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top 50</font>

182
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,800
banking apps on both iOS and Android our

183
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,909
reason for picking banking apps as we

184
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,889
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had the biggest</font>

185
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,659
motivation to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly since</font>

186
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,330
there's you know literally money on the

187
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:14,400
line so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just want to see if they did</font>

188
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,570
basic things like ssl certificate

189
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,099
pending right there's been a bunch of

190
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">studies in the past that looked at this</font>

191
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,639
and everyone always points as well no

192
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,008
one even knows how did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most simplest</font>

193
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,479
thing and pin certs and we were hoping

194
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that when we look at this after all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

195
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,770
previous publications that would have

196
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,570
fixed it most of them did some of them

197
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,909
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't saw the top 50 there were</font>

198
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,130
four on iOS that we could still<font color="#E5E5E5"> man in</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android that still</font>

200
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,610
weren't getting you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the</font>

201
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,780
most easy to use parts of cryptography

202
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,750
correctly

203
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,400
and for the permissions models now what

204
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,750
we did in this one is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually create</font>

205
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,090
an application both fri<font color="#E5E5E5"> anise and</font>

206
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">android that would use reflection and go</font>

207
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,380
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call all of the api's just to</font>

208
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,210
see what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data we can access we</font>

209
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,610
also did document scraping for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

210
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">documented ap is and what we found on</font>

211
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,990
androids case is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a app that</font>

212
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,270
had absolutely no permissions we could

213
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,710
actually read the wallpaper we could

214
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">kneel a picture that is your wallpaper</font>

215
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,979
we could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine-grained network</font>

216
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,990
activity and they've shown in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

217
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,700
that this can be used you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know even</font>

218
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,710
encrypted VoIP conversations can be

219
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,500
decoded if you have fine grain fine

220
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,570
enough grain<font color="#CCCCCC"> de yeah network traffic you</font>

221
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see a directory structure and on</font>

222
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,169
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them we were getting low level</font>

223
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,419
colonel crashes with absolutely no

224
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,950
permissions given to this app so it's

225
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,500
kind of interesting how the permission

226
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,690
system is working the reflection did not

227
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,720
work as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> in iOS because you know its</font>

228
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,280
objective c vs java so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

229
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,780
of crashes<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to get</font>

230
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,289
through but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details on that</font>

231
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,820
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper on the OS level the two you</font>

232
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,800
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of highlighted things or the</font>

application sandboxing and application

234
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,120
vetting so in the sandboxing what you

235
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,710
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is break out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

236
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,300
there's been you know a few documented

<font color="#E5E5E5">cases where malware on the wild has</font>

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,950
break out of the sandbox and fully

<font color="#E5E5E5">and then there's a lot of interesting</font>

side channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed a couple the</font>

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,510
titles in this section are also talking

249

about these were you know even perfect

253
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,930
taps and like the passwords are typing

254
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,120
into other apps and there's also a

255
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,380
publication recently that showed by just

256
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
looking at the aggregate power

257
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,510
consumption you could even see what the

258
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,549
gps radio was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Wi-Fi radios and</font>

259
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,588
buy some amazing statistics they were

260
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,770
able to geo locate themselves based on

261
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:41,770
power consumption and the application

262
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">vetting process again this has been a</font>

263
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,060
very big cat and mouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> game between you</font>

264
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,610
know malicious people and the vendors

265
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,739
and there's been ways to evade them in

266
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,209
both so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> android there's been like</font>

267
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,980
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> code loading where you would</font>

268
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,959
release the app and then

269
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">later send a payload that it would load</font>

270
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,949
and do whatever privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> invasive thing</font>

271
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,440
you wanted to do loading from unknown

272
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:04,420
sources is always dangerous but people

273
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,620
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have no guarantees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font>

274
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,160
you're able to subvert the vetting

275
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,500
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> there it can Pokemon go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

276
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been side loading it like crazy and</font>

277
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,250
then for evasion on iOS there's the

278
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,839
private epi so these are how we're

279
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,510
getting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level colonel crashes</font>

280
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,670
things that the api's have to exist

281
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,500
fundamentally and I just tell you please

282
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,579
don't use them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if there's a</font>

283
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,230
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get through their</font>

vetting process and then use them you

285
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do all sorts of interesting things</font>

286
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the phones and then finally</font>

287
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise applications so if you're a</font>

legitimately with their their

296
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,779
application now at the firmware level

297
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a place where there isn't really</font>

298
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,220
privacy enhancing technologies it's just

299
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,899
sort of most software people<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it as</font>

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware most hardware people see it is</font>

301
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,529
not really their problem either so just

302
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,329
sort of middle ground but there's a two

303
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,620
technologies or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

304
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought were interesting about the</font>

305
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,819
firmware one is they're pushing out a

306
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,339
lot of specialized coprocessors onto

307
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:13,930
mobile devices and what these do the

308
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,600
main purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they'll do things</font>

309
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,550
like record audio and talk to your

310
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,620
seller<font color="#CCCCCC"> amador an ambient light sensor</font>

311
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,449
and this is how you know when you are

312
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,889
running around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you look at your</font>

313
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,500
iphone later it says oh you know you

314
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:28,089
took 15 steps or you know 15,000 steps

315
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,639
and gives you all your workout

316
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,810
statistics and the reason that they're

317
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,819
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low-power</font>

318
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,279
coprocessors and they're on even your

319
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,959
phone seems like it's off so our concern

320
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,459
here is that you know malware or

321
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">whomever could actually leverage these</font>

322
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,209
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Google could start</font>

323
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,518
listening for words<font color="#CCCCCC"> like bomb or</font>

324
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,010
whatever you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and do you</font>

325
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,269
know covert things the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one we</font>

326
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,410
thought was interesting is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

327
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,970
you want to interact when they're

328
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,740
building these phones right say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

329
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,860
an android phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to include a</font>

330
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,990
specific chipset I'm now required to

331
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">include their drivers so that I can</font>

332
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,220
interact with a chipset where I don't I

333
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,170
didn't explicitly give them access to

334
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything but just by loading their</font>

335
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,410
driver at a very privileged level

336
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,400
you're giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them access to that you're</font>

337
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,839
giving them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys to the kingdom</font>

338
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,880
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're running at system level</font>

339
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,530
they're running at root privileges so

340
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,180
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look specifically in this</font>

341
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,910
case we looked at the NFC chip set we

342
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,280
just fuzz the NFC drivers to see you

343
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,319
know is that opening vulnerabilities in

344
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,060
the OS and you can see there's a vast

345
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,550
difference this one we looked at the

346
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,319
Nexus S the Nexus 4 at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time these</font>

347
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,240
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> newish we looked at the 5 there was</font>

348
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero crashes uninteresting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put on the</font>

349
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,500
slide galaxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 70 crash is</font>

350
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,780
uninteresting but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the takeaway is</font>

351
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,340
that you know the chips that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use and</font>

352
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,350
the drivers you include or actually

353
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,980
again adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this complexity and</font>

354
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,930
possibly open you up to vulnerabilities

355
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,760
finally that the mobile privacy at the

356
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,680
hardware level there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

357
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,780
interesting technologies one or trusted

358
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,579
execution environments these are

359
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware isolated regions that you can</font>

360
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,260
do sensitive acts you can store crypto

361
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,730
keys for example the concern we see here

362
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,920
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have unlimited access to</font>

363
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the entire system there's an entirely</font>

364
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,060
separate OS running in the trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that</font>

365
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,520
in most cases can get over there updates

366
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,890
as well and finally the dedicated

367
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,020
cryptographic units these are used to

368
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,030
protect your data at rest the concern

369
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that we see is that there's low</font>

370
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,180
visibility currently and there's not

371
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,640
much regulation on this so when the FBI

372
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,209
Apple case can Apple break their own

373
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,710
encryption you know nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really knows</font>

374
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,850
so to wrap it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just like to walk</font>

375
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,470
through an example of what we consider

376
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,840
our privacy worldview with a

377
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,700
location-based application so say we

378
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,610
have an app like you know tinder<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon</font>

379
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,340
go ways that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using and it wants to</font>

380
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,200
acquire the location of your device it

381
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">has various ways to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this it can look</font>

382
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,760
at your Wi-Fi SSID it can use GPS

383
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,040
directly tons of different side channels

384
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,040
and all these firmwares written by

385
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,410
different companies again once it has

386
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,270
access to your data so do all the third

387
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,160
party libraries that that app included

388
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,160
things like AdMob chart booster

389
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,930
companies that were not really aware of

390
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,520
again the OS apparently has access to

391
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this data right it's the main OS</font>

392
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,260
running on the phone more interestingly

393
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,900
the trusted OS that runs under all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

394
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,370
this can subvert any privacy protection

395
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,350
that's put in place at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

396
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,510
layers above it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's another</font>

397
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,500
concern that I think I was mostly

398
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,540
unaware of what we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

399
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,170
research and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interesting</font>

400
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,630
right

401
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tristana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> qualcomm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wall way that</font>

402
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,860
you maybe you didn't realize had full

403
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:29,510
control over your device then again

404
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's the baseband processor in many</font>

405
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,889
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> this shares memory so the baseband</font>

406
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,630
can access any memory directly and in

407
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,490
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the trusted OS can it can</font>

408
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,490
subvert any technologies we're deploying

409
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,529
these devices once it goes out over the

410
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">network you know any of anyone your</font>

411
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,240
cellular network if it's not encrypted

412
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:48,860
properly has access again over Wi-Fi if

413
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,870
you're an unprotected hotspot you're

414
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,540
potentially revealing your data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font>

415
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,860
it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the cloud who knows final</font>

416
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,410
interesting tidbit looking at the

417
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,930
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> Z devices it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

418
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,699
the specification that<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIM cards are</font>

419
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,229
allowed to query the GPS receiver on

420
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,689
their own they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually again run a</font>

421
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,089
separate operating system it can then

422
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,680
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your GPS the SIM card can talk</font>

423
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,860
directly to your baseband sand AT

424
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,689
commands and send SMS messages without

425
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,110
ever interacting with the application

426
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:20,540
processor weird complicated hardware

427
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,980
architecture finally once it's in the

428
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,740
cloud a lot of these will actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

429
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,910
up public API so things like tinder<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

430
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,070
been shown that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

431
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,199
query tinder<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find location of any of</font>

432
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:34,190
their users on earth and we verified

433
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's slightly creepy so in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> summary</font>

434
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,839
we think that modern devices are

435
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,699
extremely complex across all layers and

436
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that these ill-defined trust</font>

437
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,449
relationships are really what's leading

438
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,180
to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these privacy leakages you</font>

440
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,290
this trusted OS but the fact that it's

441
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,760
there they're not necessarily protecting

442
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,380
against it right that it can it can

443
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,930
subvert any of their their software

444
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,699
based mechanisms we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

445
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,439
effective privacy enhancing technologies

446
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,209
that are really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hardened</font>

447
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,949
have to take into consideration the

448
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,439
hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font>

449
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,880
bizarre interactions and we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

450
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,699
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ultimately see more and</font>

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">more data leaks if we don't do</font>

452
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,329
fundamentally new approaches so we think

453
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,250
complexity is the enemy of both security

454
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:20,529
and privacy and I will leave a couple

455
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,529
suggestions up here during the Q&A
