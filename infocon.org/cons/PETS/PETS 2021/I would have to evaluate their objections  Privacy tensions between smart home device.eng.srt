1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,439
my name is camille cobb and i'm a

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,280
postdoc at carnegie mellon university

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
in the scilab security and privacy

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,560
institute and starting this fall i'll

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,919
join the faculty at the university of

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,880
illinois

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,800
in this talk i'll discuss work that i

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,400
did in conjunction with co-authors at

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,440
carnegie mellon

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
our work focuses on the privacy risks

11
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,800
that incidental users of smart home

12
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,920
devices may face

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,359
and the tensions this can create with

14
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,039
device owners

15
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
smart home devices are everywhere and

16
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,039
they just continue to grow in popularity

17
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,720
we know from prior research and real

18
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,560
world events that these devices can have

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,199
security and privacy issues

20
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,200
overall the majority of prior research

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,719
in this space has concentrated on

22
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,040
security and privacy risks to the owners

23
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,920
of these devices and on solutions that

24
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,719
would help address

25
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,440
their needs this is super important work

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
but there's more to this picture as well

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
that's because smart home devices don't

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
only collect data about the person who

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,239
purchased them

30
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,160
they also collect data about incidental

31
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
users that is

32
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
other people who interact with or even

33
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
simply enter the physical vicinity of a

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,000
device

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
for example parents with nannies might

36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
be able to eavesdrop on them

37
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
and surveillance cameras like amazon's

38
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,040
ring doorbell can have unwanted privacy

39
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
implications for the neighbors of people

40
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
who decide to install them

41
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
there's been some research in this space

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
but it's predominantly concentrated on

43
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,080
specific

44
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,400
scenarios like the risks to nannies or

45
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,159
to airbnb guests

46
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
a cscw paper from last year did take a

47
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,520
broader view

48
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,119
and our work contributes to a similar

49
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
space however our approach provides

50
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
novel perspectives in several ways

51
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,280
first whereas previous work started by

52
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
identifying a handful of specific

53
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,840
scenarios

54
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,360
in which people might be incidental

55
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
users and then ask participants to

56
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,320
reflect on these

57
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
we wanted to develop a more

58
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
comprehensive understanding of the range

59
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,079
of situations that we should consider

60
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,600
second whereas previous work asked

61
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
people to imagine how they might feel as

62
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
an incidental user

63
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
in a particular situation we wanted to

64
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
know what they're really experiencing

65
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
and to explore the dual perspectives of

66
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
both incidental users and device owners

67
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,240
our study delves into these issues that

68
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,600
affect incidental users

69
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,079
by asking what experiences do people

70
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
have as incidental users

71
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
what privacy concerns do they have and

72
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,479
what tensions exist between incidental

73
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399
users and device owners

74
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
and then we along with participants in

75
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
our study tried to envision what

76
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
solutions would potentially help address

77
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
privacy risks that are encountered by

78
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
incidental users

79
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
to answer these questions we used a

80
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,239
mixed methods approach

81
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,840
first we conducted focus groups which

82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
gave us a formative ground-up

83
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
understanding

84
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
of the answers to these questions we ran

85
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
five in-person focus group sessions

86
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
which occurred before the pandemic

87
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,760
started

88
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319
this included a total of 21 participants

89
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,400
we recruited on local forums like

90
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
craigslist local subreddits and nextdoor

91
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,319
and we were intentional in the wording

92
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
of our recruitment ads to specify

93
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
that actually owning smart home devices

94
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,239
was not a prerequisite

95
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,840
these focus groups gave us rich

96
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,599
qualitative insights into our research

97
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,239
questions

98
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,680
and they also directly informed the

99
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
design of a survey which we deployed to

100
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
386 participants on prolific

101
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
who were demographically representative

102
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,840
of us adults

103
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
all of these methods were approved by

104
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
our institutions irb and participants

105
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
were compensated

106
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
in this talk i'll surface results from

107
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
both parts of the study but i'll do so

108
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,159
primarily through the lens of the focus

109
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,720
groups

110
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,319
and i'll spend a lot of time talking

111
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
about the solutions that focus group

112
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
participants envisioned

113
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
even though there are a lot more results

114
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,560
in the paper about the other three

115
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
questions as well

116
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,560
so again one of the goals of our study

117
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
was to get a sense of the range of

118
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
experiences people have as incidental

119
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
users

120
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
we asked people to describe times when

121
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
they had other people in their house

122
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
interacting with their smart

123
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
home devices or when they interacted

124
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
with or noticed smart home devices that

125
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
they didn't own

126
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
participants in our study talked about

127
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
their neighbors surveillance cameras

128
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
in one case being caught off guard when

129
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
a neighbor asked hey was that you

130
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
walking around your house late last

131
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,680
night

132
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
and in another case driving benefit from

133
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
their neighbor's camera because it

134
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
helped them catch the person who had

135
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
stolen a bike from their garage

136
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
they talked about watching child

137
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,200
caregivers on nanny cams in one case a

138
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
participant told a story

139
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,360
about how they saw the caregiver through

140
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,239
the nanny cam

141
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,760
and actually talked to them to tell them

142
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
they thought maybe they were rocking

143
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
their baby a little too hard

144
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,040
many describe feeling baffled by

145
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
unfamiliar smart home devices when

146
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
visiting friends or family or staying in

147
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,439
short-term rentals

148
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,799
and participants who lived with

149
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
roommates also talked about devices that

150
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
they lived with but didn't own

151
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
by and large the specific ways in which

152
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,918
people had interacted with smart home

153
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,478
devices

154
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,798
as incidental users weren't new but now

155
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,160
we had confidence that we weren't

156
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,040
missing anything

157
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
because we relied on people themselves

158
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
to tell us what was of concern

159
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
additionally our approach sometimes did

160
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
help us broaden some of these categories

161
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,320
for example beyond just nannies

162
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
participants discussed other job-related

163
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,960
reasons

164
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
that someone might be an incidental user

165
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,080
for example

166
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
babysitters might not have the exact

167
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
same experiences as nannies

168
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
and we also heard from delivery workers

169
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,199
pet sitters and about people doing

170
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
construction work at participants homes

171
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
so in surveys we asked people about

172
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
their experiences in each of these five

173
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
situations

174
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
and we found that 91 percent of survey

175
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
participants had been incidental users

176
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,080
you can read more in the paper about the

177
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
prevalence of each of these types of

178
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
situations

179
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
in most focus group sessions privacy

180
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,600
concerns arose naturally in the

181
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
discussion that followed our initial

182
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,440
prompt

183
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
which was just to simply describe their

184
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
experiences this reinforces that privacy

185
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
related thoughts were very salient in

186
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,320
this context

187
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
and important to address in these

188
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
sessions participants described concerns

189
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
from the perspectives of both device

190
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
owners and incidental users

191
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
for example as device owners people

192
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
pointed out that someone could do things

193
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:25,919
like

194
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,360
come over to your house and ask your

195
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
echo device hey what's on my calendar

196
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
tomorrow

197
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
which might reveal private information

198
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,000
although our aim was primarily to study

199
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,680
privacy concerns that incidental users

200
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,160
had

201
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,759
rather than concerns that device owners

202
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,440
have about incidental users

203
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,800
it's useful to understand that these

204
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
coexist because as i'll discuss in just

205
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,440
a bit

206
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
some solutions could simultaneously

207
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,039
address both types of concerns

208
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
concerns also came up in the context of

209
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
discussing benefits of smart home

210
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,280
devices

211
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
even when people had privacy concerns

212
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
they were frequently excited about the

213
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
potential usefulness of smart home

214
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
devices

215
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
from the perspective of incidental users

216
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
participants described concerns

217
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
related to governments advertisers and

218
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,280
device manufacturers

219
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,759
and even the device owners themselves as

220
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,440
with a lot of privacy focused work

221
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
they often didn't have specific threats

222
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
or harms in mind but instead expressed a

223
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
general feeling of unease

224
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
like one participant had been a delivery

225
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
driver and he said

226
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
that sometimes when he delivered

227
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
packages to people's houses

228
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
who had surveillance cameras they would

229
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
ask him to look directly at the camera

230
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
so they'd have a view of his face

231
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,240
before they would let him inside to

232
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
finish his delivery and

233
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
even though he understood why homeowners

234
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
might ask him to do this he said that it

235
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,080
made him feel

236
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
kind of creeped out some participants

237
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
described factors that might affect

238
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
their degree of concern

239
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
like the location of devices whether

240
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
it's inside or outside

241
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,919
maybe specific rooms might feel less

242
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
okay than others for example bathrooms

243
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,319
or

244
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
bedrooms where people might be sleeping

245
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
especially if they're staying overnight

246
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,240
the relationship people have with device

247
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
owners might make a difference

248
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,599
and how often or how long they're

249
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,520
spending at the home are they there

250
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,319
overnight sleeping or are they there for

251
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,599
just a short time

252
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,080
does these visits occur over a long

253
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
period of time in their life or just in

254
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,199
a short window

255
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
and then also they talked about the

256
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
impact of whether the device owner was

257
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
also present while they were there

258
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
so for example pet sitters might often

259
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
be at the home

260
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
when device owners are not present but

261
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
usually when you're visiting a friend or

262
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,319
family member

263
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,880
they're around and they saw some devices

264
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,479
as more concerning than others

265
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
so issues related to cameras and voice

266
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,000
assistants

267
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
were discussed most frequently and

268
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
enthusiastically during the focus groups

269
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
though other types of devices came up as

270
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
well and we took this into account in

271
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
our survey design by asking specifically

272
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,599
about cameras and voice assistants

273
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
and grouping other types of devices into

274
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
two broad categories of

275
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
smart door locks thermostats smart

276
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,400
lights and smart plugs

277
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
and appliances robot vacuums and other

278
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,599
kinds of smart home devices

279
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,440
so since these were focus groups we got

280
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,639
a list of concerns

281
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,000
and a sense of the factors that might

282
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
affect concern but it's also important

283
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,720
to know

284
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
which ones have are stronger or weaker

285
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
and which ones occur more often or less

286
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,440
often

287
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
and that's not an answer we could get

288
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,479
from the focus groups but it is an

289
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,039
answer we designed the survey to provide

290
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
in our survey we asked participants how

291
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
they felt about the privacy utility

292
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,199
trade-offs

293
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,720
for a certain type of device in a

294
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
particular situation

295
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
so across all device types and

296
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
situations for about half of the

297
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,039
combinations

298
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
participants indicated appreciation but

299
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
they disliked device's presence 20

300
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
percent of the time

301
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,160
if you're interested in particular

302
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
combinations of devices and settings

303
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
we have results for that in the paper

304
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,120
for now i'll just mention that

305
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
participants tended to dislike cameras

306
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,159
and voice assistants more than other

307
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,440
types of devices

308
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
and they seemed especially uncomfortable

309
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
about cameras and short-term rentals

310
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
which over half of participants said

311
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
they disliked

312
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
our analysis showed that when a

313
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
participant had actually experienced a

314
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,040
scenario

315
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,959
rather than just imagining themselves

316
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
seeing that type of device in that

317
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,760
situation

318
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
they were more likely to be appreciative

319
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
of the device

320
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
while it's possible that this pattern is

321
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
due to people avoiding situations that

322
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
they anticipated

323
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,279
would make them uncomfortable this

324
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
difference speaks to the importance of

325
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
understanding people's perspectives

326
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
on situations they've actually

327
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
experienced in addition to understanding

328
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
how they would imagine themselves

329
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,320
feeling

330
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
if the situation were to occur we also

331
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
found that people who

332
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
own devices themselves were more likely

333
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
to appreciate devices presence

334
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
when they encountered them as incidental

335
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,320
users in some sense it's unsurprising

336
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
that people who decide to buy devices

337
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
themselves

338
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,399
are more comfortable with smart home

339
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
devices in general but based on focus

340
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
group discussions

341
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
it might be more complex than this for

342
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
example considering the privacy risk

343
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
utility balance it's hard to get utility

344
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
out of a device that you don't know how

345
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,560
to use

346
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,440
so people who own devices themselves

347
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
might therefore know how to use

348
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
and therefore drive benefits from

349
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
devices when they encounter them

350
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
outside of their own home which could

351
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
help tip the balance toward utility and

352
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
away from

353
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,839
privacy concern similarly people may

354
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,839
feel less concerned about privacy

355
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,360
if they have a better understanding of

356
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
what the device is and is not capable of

357
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,240
collecting

358
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
which a device owner might be more

359
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
likely to already know about because

360
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
they own the device themselves

361
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
these differences and reactions of

362
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
device owners and non-owners

363
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,480
start to speak to the tensions that may

364
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
arise getting a better understanding of

365
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
these tensions can help us determine

366
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,279
are these fundamental differences or is

367
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,640
it just due to misunderstandings that

368
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
could potentially be addressed more

369
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
easily for example through conversation

370
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
because participants in focus groups had

371
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,160
a mix of experiences

372
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,399
with and as incidental users both

373
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,920
perspectives were present in these

374
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,880
discussions

375
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,480
we observed disagreeing views between

376
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
participants but many participants were

377
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,399
also self-aware that their preferences

378
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
as a device owner were sometimes in

379
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,839
conflict with their preferences as an

380
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,079
incidental user

381
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
in the survey we explored these tensions

382
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,279
by asking participants whether they

383
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
would be willing to move or relocate a

384
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
device if they found out it was making

385
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
someone else uncomfortable

386
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
we asked about them being willing to

387
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,079
move the devices for a neighbor

388
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,279
a friend or family member who was

389
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
visiting a person living with them

390
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,839
or a person working in their home

391
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,959
surprisingly

392
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,120
90 of participants were willing to make

393
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
these accommodations in at least some

394
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,760
cases

395
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,279
but this willingness was often

396
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,000
conditional only 48 percent

397
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
of participants were willing to move or

398
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
relocate devices

399
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
for someone who was working in their

400
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
home people who

401
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
were more comfortable with devices

402
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
themselves were also less likely to be

403
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480
willing to accommodate others

404
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
some survey participants gave free

405
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,839
response answers to explain how they

406
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,120
would determine whether to move or

407
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
relocate a device that was making

408
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,399
someone else uncomfortable

409
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
they often noted that they would want a

410
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
specific reason saying things like

411
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,279
i would have to evaluate their

412
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,920
objections or it depends on what the

413
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
reason was

414
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,160
my cousin who's paranoid about big

415
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
brother listening in no

416
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
we would not turn it off as i said

417
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,880
before

418
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
many people feel uncomfortable about the

419
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,079
presence of smart home devices

420
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,680
even if they can't always convey a clear

421
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
reason for this discomfort

422
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
and so it might actually mean that

423
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,480
people who are uncomfortable

424
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
have a hard time getting their

425
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,760
preferences met by device owners

426
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,600
so we asked focus group participants to

427
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
draw pictures of their ideas for

428
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,079
addressing

429
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,680
the privacy concerns that were brought

430
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
up it's useful and interesting to get

431
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
ideas for solutions directly from

432
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,240
participants

433
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
since they're experts in their own

434
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
experience and often

435
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
solutions that people come up with can

436
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,079
help us better understand the

437
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,440
characteristics that are most

438
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
important for solutions that we

439
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
eventually implement i'll show you a

440
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,320
couple of pictures in a minute but a few

441
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,279
themes that showed up

442
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
were that as incidental users many

443
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
participants wanted to be informed about

444
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,959
the presence location

445
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,800
or data collection capabilities of

446
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,160
devices they encountered

447
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,079
and they wanted to have a chance to give

448
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
consent for data collection

449
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,639
or not they propose solutions that could

450
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,040
be implemented now with existing devices

451
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
or requiring only a conversation and in

452
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,720
some cases they said they already did

453
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
some of these things

454
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,519
and they also proposed approaches that

455
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,760
would require new technology designs

456
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
the envision solutions sometimes put the

457
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
onus for addressing privacy risks on

458
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
device owners

459
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
and other times gave that power and

460
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
responsibility

461
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
to incidental users or technology

462
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,639
creators

463
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,079
first i'll show a few drawings of

464
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,760
solutions that would involve actions by

465
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
the device owner

466
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
one participant felt that devices should

467
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
only be placed in clearly visible

468
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,040
locations

469
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
so that an incidental user would know

470
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,959
that the devices are there

471
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
a common suggestion was for device

472
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
owners to put up signs in or outside of

473
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
their homes to let passerby and visitors

474
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,560
know

475
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
that there might be a device around that

476
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
could record data about them when

477
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
they're in this location

478
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
and people talked about this being

479
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
pretty similar to when you have a

480
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,920
surveillance system in your home and put

481
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
a decal in your front window

482
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,040
in this drawing we see a conversation

483
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
that's happening between the device

484
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
owner and a babysitter

485
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,959
in this case it's initiated by the

486
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,959
device owner although the device owner

487
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,399
is telling the babysitter that they have

488
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,199
a nanny cam

489
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,680
somewhere they don't say where it is and

490
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
in this drawing it's hidden inside of a

491
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,560
teddy bear toy

492
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,399
in some sessions participants suggested

493
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
that there may be situations in which

494
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,519
it's appropriate for device owners to

495
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,480
hide devices

496
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
in order for the devices to achieve

497
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
their desired goals in this case a

498
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
participant is showing how

499
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
you could let someone know that there's

500
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
a device present even if you don't tell

501
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,600
them exactly where it is

502
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
some participants noted the limitations

503
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
of solutions that required action from

504
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,000
device owners

505
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,519
and they felt that incidental users

506
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,880
should be empowered to take action

507
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
themselves

508
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
in both surveys and focus groups many

509
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
participants said that they would just

510
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
unplug devices they saw if they were

511
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
making them uncomfortable

512
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,839
and several participants said that they

513
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,440
would proactively look for devices

514
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,279
whenever they enter a new space

515
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,800
if they know that a device is around

516
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
then incidental users can at least adapt

517
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,519
their behavior

518
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,440
for example by avoiding sensitive topics

519
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
of conversation in the vicinity of a

520
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,079
voice assistant

521
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,440
in this drawing we can see someone who's

522
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
proactively looking for voice assistant

523
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,639
devices by

524
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
entering a space and immediately calling

525
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
out wake words for the most popular

526
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,800
voice assistants and if they hear a

527
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,079
response then they know they're

528
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,959
potentially being listened to

529
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
some solutions involved redesigns of the

530
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,160
devices themselves

531
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
for example these drawings show smart

532
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,000
cameras and voice assistants that

533
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
beep or speak to let someone know that

534
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,120
they're there

535
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
participants pointed out that this could

536
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,199
get annoying so maybe the devices should

537
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:05,760
detect

538
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
new people entering the space and only

539
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,440
vocalize if the person would not already

540
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
reasonably know that the device is there

541
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
we saw several variations of privacy

542
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
modes including

543
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
buttons to stop data collection apps

544
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,199
that would maybe like

545
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,279
convey an incidental user's preferred

546
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,040
privacy settings to the devices they

547
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,680
encounter

548
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
and then alter privacy configurations to

549
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,720
suit

550
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
the preferences in the context of a

551
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,079
device owner's

552
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,360
willingness to accommodate those

553
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
settings and then other mechanisms to

554
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
partially or temporarily disable data

555
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
collection

556
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
the idea of voice prints came up

557
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
repeatedly across several sessions

558
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
possibly because commodity voice

559
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
assistants are already integrating

560
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
similar features

561
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,079
participants envisioned that voice

562
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,440
assistance could help with both the

563
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
device owners and incidental users

564
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,160
risks they could be set such that voice

565
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
data is not collected without a person's

566
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,240
consent and they could also be said such

567
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
that unauthorized users

568
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
wouldn't be able to trigger certain

569
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
voice commands

570
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,360
similarly but for cameras several

571
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,199
participants imagine software that could

572
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
automatically blur or censor the faces

573
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,959
of people who didn't opt into data

574
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,279
collection

575
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,160
to summarize most people are incidental

576
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,199
users

577
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
even if people aren't worried about

578
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
privacy in the majority of situations

579
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,920
where they interact with other people's

580
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
smart home devices privacy concerns are

581
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,880
still

582
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,680
common device owners are often willing

583
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
to accommodate incidental users

584
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,959
but in our paper we argue that we should

585
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
make it easier for incidental users to

586
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
express when they're uncomfortable at

587
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,279
about a device

588
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,040
and that we should make it possible for

589
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
device owners to collect

590
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
less data about incidental users while

591
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,160
still getting the main benefits they

592
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,079
want from their devices

593
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,480
when prioritizing which solutions to

594
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,360
implement

595
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
we should of course create solutions

596
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
that address the needs of large numbers

597
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,440
of people

598
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
but we should also factor in existing

599
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
power dynamics and create solutions

600
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,120
that are useful for incidental users who

601
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,639
might currently find it especially

602
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,639
difficult to achieve their privacy goals

603
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,040
for example workers in homes where

604
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
device owners might be unwilling to

605
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,520
make accommodations for them thanks so

606
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,319
much for

607
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,839
your time and i'm looking forward to

608
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,359
having discussions with you about this

609
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,918
work
