00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,199
hello everyone my name is leonardo

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,640
abunda and i will present it today the

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,480
paper real time analysis of private

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,599
privacy network iot applications this

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,960
project is a collaboration effort

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,160
between researchers from the service

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,679
physical system security lab

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,599
for international university and other

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
colleagues from purdue and penn state

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
university

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,000
in this project we are introducing

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
healthy watch a private analysis tool

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,640
that uncovers how it apps handle and

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
share sensitive information

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
potentially exposing the user's privacy

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
the lt watch considers the privacy

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,320
preference from iot users

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,239
and applies natural language processing

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
because of to classify iot data into

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,680
privacy levels

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,280
that are easy to understand by the user

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
the outline of this presentation is as

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,879
follows first

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,239
we will overview the main process

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
challenges in iot that we target in this

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,520
paper

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,760
then we will present the trend model and

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
the main result from a privacy server

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
that we perform with real iot users the

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,600
survey aimed to uncover privacy

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
expectations and concerns of users

32
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
of iot applications we will continue the

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,159
presentation with an overview of iot

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,280
watch architecture

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,799
detailing the source code analyzes and

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
implementation of the tools

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
the runtime analysis and nlp model that

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
we use to classify information extracted

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
from the apps into specific privacy

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
levels

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,720
finally we will discuss our our

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,000
revelation results

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,840
and finish the presentation with the

44
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,880
conclusions

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
there are four privacy challenges in iot

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,640
that we target in this work

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
we use a representation of a real iot

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
application to explain these challenges

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
first the description block of an iot

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
app

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
not always informed the user about the

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
ad functionality or the way they use the

53
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,720
data collected from devices and the user

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,960
in fact we found that 25 percent of the

55
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,320
last app

56
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,560
didn't have any form of discretion block

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,840
in it

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
second we all said that even though the

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
user is required to grant permissions to

60
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,640
access

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
the iot data handled by the apps the

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
user is not always the one defining the

63
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,479
recipient of the

64
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,360
information notifications for instance

65
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
in the specific case of internet calls

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,479
used to send data to external servers

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
the developers define the data

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
recipients in almost all the cases

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
and the user is never informed also

70
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,720
we also have cases where this

71
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
information is sent out

72
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,959
from the application to the internet in

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,000
plain text

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
making the sensitive data available to

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
its droppers

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
finally we found cases of malicious apps

77
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
where the attacker

78
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,040
including functions to leak information

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,440
to

80
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,319
monetize paris with malicious endpoints

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,200
or hard code

82
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,640
recipients before iot wash iot

83
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,239
applications didn't have any mechanics

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
to expose these privacy concerns

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
and risk to the iot to the iot user

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
based on the previous private challenges

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
we consider the following tracks in this

88
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,599
work

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
first we consider application accessing

90
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
privacy information without without

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
informing the user via an app discretion

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
block

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
then we consider iot applications that

94
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,319
are capable of leaking information

95
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,000
either via dangerous or malicious

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,959
functions we also consider apps the high

97
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,800
malicious or an expect functionality to

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
the user

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
and finally we consider apps both in our

100
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,920
mileages

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,599
that do not properly protect information

102
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,359
they share with external servers

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
our main goal in this world is to assign

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
a privacy tool capable of translating

105
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
the app's privacy behavior

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
into simple privacy levels that the user

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,159
can understand

108
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,799
then with this information the user

109
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,400
should be capable of making an informed

110
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,959
decision

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,560
and reject the apps that do not comply

112
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
with the privacy preferences

113
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
in order to do that we want that we want

114
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,519
to consider the privacy concern of users

115
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,760
with diabetes systems

116
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,599
we perform a privacy survey and collect

117
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,560
information from 112 participants

118
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
that use iot systems in this survey

119
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
we included questions covering the

120
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,959
participant demographics

121
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,280
their privacy concerns with iot systems

122
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,879
and their point of view regarding the

123
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,480
need for privacy analysis tools in iot

124
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
the server result demonstrates that the

125
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,239
user of iot system is in general

126
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
concerned with the use of of the

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
previous information

128
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
however we also noticed that there is no

129
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,440
clear conception of what kind of data

130
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
and information should be considered

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,680
private

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
private there was a general agreement on

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
the need of a user-friendly privacy

134
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,280
analysis tool

135
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,919
however the participants want to have

136
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
the capability of configuring the tool

137
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,759
so it can be adapted to their own

138
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
privacy preferences

139
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
finally the participants welcomed the

140
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,840
idea of receiving notifications

141
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,759
that uncover what the iot apps do with

142
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
the sensitive data in real time

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
aggressive privacy channels of iot

144
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
applications while covering the privacy

145
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
expectation of users

146
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
we propose iot wash a dynamic tool that

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,320
uncovers privacy risks from iot

148
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
applications in real time

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
there are three main steps included in

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
the iot wash analysis

151
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
first at instrumentation time the two

152
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,360
analyzes the

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
iot applications and modify the source

154
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
code to enable the collection of privacy

155
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
related information

156
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
also our instrumentation step permits

157
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,600
the implementation of a notification

158
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,479
system

159
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,680
that informs the user our findings

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
finally we also instrument the iot

161
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
applications to offer an additional

162
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,479
interface

163
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
that the user can realize to select the

164
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
privacy preference with the app

165
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
and create a privacy profile

166
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
such a profile within which includes the

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
type of information that the user

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,560
considers as privacy sensitive

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
is defined by the user of an iot

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
application at its own time

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
finally at runtime the lte

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,680
delta dlt watch collects apps data

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
analyzes to uncover privacy risks in

174
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
real time

175
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
the analysis includes the classification

176
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
of iot data into privacy levels

177
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,199
that are easy to understand by the by

178
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
the end user

179
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
also the iot watch determines if the app

180
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
the app information is sent out from the

181
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
app in plain text

182
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
finally our tooling for the user about

183
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
the findings in a form of a

184
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
privacy notification

185
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,759
the iot watch most of our country

186
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,120
attended three different technical

187
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
challenges to

188
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
support its analysis the first chance is

189
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,319
that the tool must be capable of

190
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,919
performing effective source code

191
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,800
analysis

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
to identify code structures that may be

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,880
related with privacy behavior

194
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,479
since iot applications from different

195
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,400
platform platforms can be written with

196
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
using different programming languages we

197
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
propose using

198
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
a code translator that converts

199
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
application code into an intermediate

200
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
representation

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,400
from there our tool extracts the

202
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,199
asymmetric

203
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,680
syntax tree of an application and allows

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
it to identify nodes

205
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
calls or binary expressions that could

206
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
contain privacy information

207
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
iot watch focuses on sensitive

208
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,720
information leaving the iot obligations

209
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
hence we focus on source structure that

210
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,479
handles data flows from

211
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
sensitive sources and three functions

212
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,759
that sim calls

213
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
two specific examples of these sync

214
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,000
functions are iot messages

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,880
and internet calls in general iot

216
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
messages are used in the application to

217
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,479
send notification to the user

218
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,160
these notifications may include

219
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
information related to the user behavior

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
or location

221
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
on the other hand internet calls are

222
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
used in the iot applications to send

223
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,360
data

224
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,039
to send application data to external

225
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,759
servers via http calls

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,840
these calls may include information on

227
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
device states and iot system

228
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,159
configurations

229
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,639
the second technical challenge of the

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
iot wash is related with the

231
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,039
instrumentation instrumentation step

232
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,879
once iot was identified the source code

233
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,319
for sensitive information

234
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,080
and the functions used to share this

235
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
data it must modify the original source

236
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,319
code of an application to enable

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,520
collecting the privacy relevant

238
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
information

239
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
specifically our two colleagues

240
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
information defined by the developer

241
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,919
the user or both that is used by the app

242
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,440
as a recipient of the sensitive

243
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
information

244
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
also our tool collects the content of

245
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
the applications in calls

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,759
to uncover the type of sensory

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
information handled by the app

248
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
the instrumentation and step variety

249
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
wash also provides

250
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
support for additional functionality on

251
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,360
the one hand

252
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
the instrumentation one step permits

253
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,479
creating a user interface

254
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
that can be used but that can be used to

255
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,519
select

256
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
to select the user privacy preference

257
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,640
and create the

258
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
privacy profile as an example in the

259
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,040
figure to the right

260
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
the user selects the an enforcer watch

261
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
that she wants to track

262
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,279
whether the application handles data

263
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,440
related with the device information and

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
the location

265
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
on the other hand the instrumentation of

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
iot applications also permits

267
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
implementing notification mechanisms

268
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
that are well too that our tour can use

269
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
to inform the user regarding its

270
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
findings in real time

271
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
for instance in the figure to the in the

272
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,920
figure

273
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,519
the users select the to receive

274
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
notifications every time

275
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
the app executes suspicious or dangerous

276
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
internet communications

277
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
that contain data related with the

278
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,839
location and device information

279
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,519
[Music]

280
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,839
finally the iot watch must be capable of

281
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,120
translating the content of an

282
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,640
application communications into a

283
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,360
language

284
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,240
that the user can understand for this

285
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
and by using the result from the our

286
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
privacy server

287
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
we define four specific privacy labels

288
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
that cover information related with the

289
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
iot devices the user

290
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,320
and device location the user behavior

291
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
and the date time information embedded

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
into iot messages and calls iot watch

293
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
uses natural language processing

294
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
to classify app communication content

295
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,839
into these four privacy labels

296
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
then these privacy levels are compared

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
with the user privacy profile

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
and if a match is found that will inform

299
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
the user with a privacy notification

300
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
the table to the left provides specific

301
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
example of a real communication content

302
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
that will define as a privacy string and

303
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
the corresponding privacy label

304
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
as you can see we consider that the

305
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
message the thermostat is

306
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
turned on leaks information related

307
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
mainly information related with the

308
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
devices

309
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
and the message door is not opening

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
since the car was not present at home

311
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,240
less than 15 seconds ago my league

312
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,079
information related with devices which

313
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,040
is the door

314
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,760
the location a home and the date time

315
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
which happened 15 seconds

316
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
seconds ago similar type of information

317
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,600
in fleet

318
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
can be used by a malicious actor to

319
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
infer that the house is empty

320
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,959
or that the door was left open

321
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
the figure to the right shows some

322
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,279
examples of notification received by the

323
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
users of iot watch

324
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,040
these notifications reflect on the user

325
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
privacy preference and profile

326
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
for instance in the first case iot

327
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,959
watching for the user that a

328
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,720
communication containing information

329
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
related to the location was identified

330
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
by the two

331
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
as you can see the location was one of

332
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
the privacy levels including the in the

333
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
user privacy profile

334
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
in the second example iot washing for

335
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
the user that the communication was sent

336
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,200
by

337
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
to the internet in plain text in plain

338
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,680
text which is also which also matches

339
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,959
the design of the user to

340
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,360
notified every time an insecure internet

341
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
communication happens

342
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
we use natural language processing

343
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
techniques to convert application data

344
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
into privacy levels

345
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
we first tried training the nlp model

346
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
with corpora

347
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
data extract from no general knowledge

348
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,399
databases

349
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
however our reclassification attempts

350
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
achieve very low accuracy

351
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
we analyze these initial results and

352
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,680
conclude that their

353
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
drt strings extract from the

354
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
applications are different from the

355
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
generic

356
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,880
knowledge corpora in very specific ways

357
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
for instance

358
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,240
we notice that lt strings are short and

359
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,160
don't have a very well defined semantic

360
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,360
structure

361
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
also we've realized that regarding their

362
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
size which is normally a few words

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
they contain a high amount of

364
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
information

365
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
we then create an honesty corpus uh with

366
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
data strategy from real iot applications

367
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
and use this data set to train our nlp

368
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
model

369
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
in total we extract to test 2014

370
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
different iot strings

371
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
covering the four privacy levels from

372
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
different 380 different iot applications

373
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
with this with this new iot corpus we

374
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,480
were unable to improve our

375
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
classification results

376
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,959
in total we extract data from 440

377
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,519
different

378
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,399
540 different smartthings application to

379
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,040
implement an evaluate iot watch

380
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
from the previous slide we learned that

381
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
information extract from 380

382
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,680
of those apps was used to train and test

383
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,040
the nlp model

384
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,480
then the remaining 100 160 applications

385
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
were used to avoid the lt watch

386
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,519
performance

387
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
out of the total applications using

388
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,720
evaluation

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
120 applications were denied and 40

390
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
applications were collected from

391
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
repositories containing malicious

392
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
applications

393
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,160
we have always the average accuracy

394
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,079
recall precision and specificity

395
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
of our tool in converting iot privacy

396
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
data into privacy levels

397
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,800
also we performed that analysis for

398
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
different decision trestle

399
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
in general our result demonstrates that

400
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
nlp can be used to effectively convert

401
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
data handled bioti applications into

402
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
privacy levels

403
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
that are easy to understand but by the

404
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
regular user

405
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
specifically our tool achieved the

406
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
highest accuracy while converting data

407
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,360
that contain information related to

408
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,440
location and obtaining the lowest

409
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,160
classification

410
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
accuracy with information related with

411
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
the date time

412
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,839
finally our model achieved the best

413
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
result from a classification travel

414
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,399
threshold

415
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,079
of 0.4

416
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,680
also evaluated how the iot apps

417
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
including this work by alerting the

418
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
process expectation of users

419
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
in the case of sensitive data being

420
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
shared with via iot messages

421
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
we found that novena applications

422
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
leaking information

423
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,959
however we found 29 data leaks from a

424
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
total of 58 messages

425
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199
extract from the 40 malicious

426
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,880
applications

427
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
in the case of internet communications

428
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,000
we found 11 leaks from 120 apps

429
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
and 22 links from 40 malicious

430
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
applications

431
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
finally we identified six applications

432
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,880
tremendous and treatment issues

433
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
that send the data over the internet and

434
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,120
clear text

435
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
as a conclusion for this work we present

436
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
iot wash

437
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
a runtime analysis tool used to avoid

438
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
privacy and security risks from iot

439
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
applications

440
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
iot was successfully performed source

441
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
code analysis and implementation

442
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,040
to collect data and enable privacy

443
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,720
analysis from iot application

444
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,199
applications using nlp iot watch analyze

445
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,040
540 different smartthing applications

446
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
and effectively identify data links

447
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
in and privacy concerns from the

448
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,320
applications in 100

449
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,600
of the cases additionally we were able

450
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
to classify privacy related

451
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
data flows in over 94 percent of the

452
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,440
cases

453
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,519
finally iot watch performance yield

454
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
minimal overhead to the iot applications

455
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
and systems
