andres fitzman

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
who was really an instrumental leader in

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,000
creating this community

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
um and one of the first people to work

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
on anonymous communication technologies

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,280
um and someone who in addition to you

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,559
know his research work

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
was really a leader in using privacy

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
research to influence policy

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,000
and to communicate it to the general

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,760
public as well as government

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
so with that i'll i'll talk a little bit

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,159
about our award process

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
we had 42 papers which we considered

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,720
um we had to exclude a paper because of

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,360
a

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
conflict of interest with the award

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
chairs but 42 papers were considered

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
to be eligible of course it had to be a

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
paper accepted at pets 2021 with a

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,600
student first author

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,880
and the the award-worthiness

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,079
was that at least one pc reviewer gave

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,000
it a rating as perhaps suitable so that

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
was part of the review process

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
so out of these 42 papers that were

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
considered

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,720
we looked at them and shortlisted 15

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
papers based on the pc reviews and the

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
abstracts

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,880
and then we selected the winners based

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,360
on criteria as laid out by the

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
award description based on the papers

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
the presentations

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,640
um and then the comments from

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,360
participants

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
okay so without further ado the best

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,520
student paper award winners so we'll

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479

passed away five years ago

126
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
still very well and

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
have him close to our hearts he has been

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,199
a dedicated

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,240
privacy activist a british privacy

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
advocate he was also for several years

132
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
the chief privacy advisor at microsoft

133
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
and he was known that he was

134
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
fighting for the right to privacy and

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
freedom from mass surveillance he was

136
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
very active both in the technical

137
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
and also the political social debates

138
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
and he believed deeply in the key role

139
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
of pets

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
as a means to protect these rights to

141
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,479
privacy

142
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
and he was involved in the pets

143
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
community

144
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,639
for most of his its history

145
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,680
and so it was really a severe loss

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,039
for many reasons and he also served at

147
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,120
the pets advisory board

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
and he was last but not least also

149
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,000
instrumental in both creating the pet

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
award but also for securing

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,639
its initial funding so that these are

152
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,160
the reasons why

153
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,600
and today we also commemorate and

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
kaspar bowden when we are handing out

155
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,199

generous help of

161
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
a number of very prominent members of

broad scope international committee

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,599
trying to cover possibly all aspects of

165
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,319
of privacy and we had 13 active members

166
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
plus the two of us

167
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120

including

169
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
the committee members who were

170
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000

173
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,680
paper was nominated independently to ice

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
so we removed that i mean we considered

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:48,960
it

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,919
you know jointly and we run a

177
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,800
three-round

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,039
review process or discussion or an

179
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,280
assessment process within the committee

180
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,520
the motivation for that was to try to

181
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
balance the workload for the committee

182
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,840
and get a uh

183
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,080
as a thorough discussion

184
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
and in some cases debate on all uh on

185
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
all papers and all nominations

186
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
let me remind that this was not a

187
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,319
judgment on papers which were all

188
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
well accepted and successful uh pieces

189
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
of work but rather

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,479
was a discussion on the nominations

191
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,720
themselves and the merits towards an

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
award

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,799
and we ended up with a clear winner

194
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,839
and two also very clear

195
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839
runner-up papers next slide please

196
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,839
so let me shed a little uh more light on

197
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,160
the

198
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
uh the review process uh

199
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
here you see the the generous effort

200
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,560
made by all

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
committee members they were initially

202
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
against seven to twelve assignments for

203
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
each committee member

204
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
and around the first round

205
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,440
we concluded that 22 of the

206
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,279
33-1 nominations

207
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,480
were excellent pieces of work but

208
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
not at the level that this prestigious

209
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,279
award

210
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
would require then in round two

211
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
uh we discussed further 10

212
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,440
of all the nominations we narrowed down

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
and

214
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,720
we we looked deeper and i can say that

215
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
even if there were disagreements

216
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
among the committee members we gave the

217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,080
chance

218
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,720
to many of these nominations to to go

219
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
forward even if there was for example

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
single negative opinion this is

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
important so

222
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,720
this is allowed for very healthy uh

223
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,480
discussion and in the end

224
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
there were four top-ranked nominations

225
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,959
that stood out and

226
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
they were normally reviewed by the

227
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,120
entire committee that had no conflict of

228
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
interest with any of these four

229
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
final top-ranked nominations

230
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,200
once the opinions were recorded

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,079
each member casted a vote that ranked

232
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,320
basically those four finalists

233
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
and uh using the single transferable

234
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
vote protocol

235
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,279
we determined the winner and the

236
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
runner-up

237
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
papers and

238
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
i think now we uh the next slide

239
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,920
we will see the second runner-up paper

240
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,560
so

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
let's please proceed data share

242
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,519
network a decentralized privacy

243
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,959

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,880
journalists and if i were to use

246
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
words from the discussion within the

247
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
committee

248
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
this was an open source novel solution

249
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
addressing privacy requirements elicited

250
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,079
in

251
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
cooperation with ngos and journalists

252
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
a combination of practical and

253
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,720
theoretical

254
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,760

and in the next slide we'll see

259
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
the first runner-up paper

260
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,440
the next slide please watching you watch

261

everyone was waiting for uh if we go to

277
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,800
the next slide we'll see

278
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
which one is the winner for this year

279
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
and this is

280
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,360
does learning require memorization a

281
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,399
short tale

282
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,079
about a long tail authored by vitaly

283
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,360
feldman

284
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,600
a a warm round of applause please for

285
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,760
vitali congratulations

286
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,079
uh what we will do next is we will

287
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,519
watch a short award

288
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,040
presentation by one of the members of

289
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
the committee

290
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
so that will be in video form because

291
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,000
the member of the committee that we

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,959
invited to

293
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,560
to deliver this talk dali kafar is

294
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
in australia and this is very late for

295
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,600
him

296
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
but he was very kind to provide this

297
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,480
video so

298
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
let's enjoy let's listen to uh to dali

299
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,519
uh

300
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
regarding this paper

301
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,639
so this year's casper brought in better

302
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,079
award for outstanding

303
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
research in privacy enhancing

304
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,200
technologies

305
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
is recognizing the paper authored by

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,959
vitaly feldman

307
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,480
and published in 2020 in the 52nd acm

308
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
symposium on theory of computing

309
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,079
stock 2020 and entitled does learning

310
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
require memorization

311
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
a short tale about a long time and so

312
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
the paper context is really about

313
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
machine learning

314
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
so this year's casper project patch

315
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,600
award for outstanding research in

316
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
privacy enhancing technologies

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
is recognizing the paper authored by

318
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
vital development

319
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,279
and published in 2020 in the 52nd acm

320
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
symposium on theory of computing

321
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,880
stock 2020 and entitled does learning

322
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
require memorization

323
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,079
a short tale about a long tail and so

324
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,120
the paper context is really about

325
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
machine learning and in particular deep

326
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,720
learning models

327
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,839
or deep neural networks models that have

328
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,120
been well known to

329
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,519
nearly perfectly fit their training sets

330
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,839
the phenomena that we call overfitting

331
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,360
and that has been demonstrated

332
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
empirically on several occasions

333
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,519
in fact overfitting happens so much that

334
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
the models too fit even to

335
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
random and sometimes useless labels or

336
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
classes

337
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,839
and this phenomena has been also

338
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,000
demonstrated and observed in many

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,120
real-life application scenarios and we

340
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
like to call this particular phenomena

341
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
memorization the point here is that

342
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
natural data distributions have classes

343
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
that are rare enough

344
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
that you may only have one example of

345
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,920
those

346
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,320
and for these examples memorizing that

347
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,079
particular example is crucial

348
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,639
to have any chance at all on those

349
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,320
classes to be predicted

350
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,560
or classified correctly by the model

351
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
and so what the paper is proposing is

352
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,160
the first conceptual explanation and a

353
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
theoretical model

354
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
for this memorization and overfitting

355
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,320
behavior

356
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
more precisely the paper is really

357
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,279
demonstrating for the long tail data

358
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
distributions which is natural data

359
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,560
distribution

360
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
for various machine learning tasks and

361
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
for real life

362
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
data sets in fact memorization is

363
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
necessary

364
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
for accurate learning the results also

365
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,759
explain

366
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,079
why differential privacy mechanisms for

367
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,680
instance which is

368
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,759
essentially a way to limit the model

369
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,040
memorization

370
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,279
have disparity effects on some subgroups

371
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,360
but more generally the problem of

372
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
understanding why machine learning

373
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,519
models leak information about their

374
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,959
training data

375
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,279
and what the costs of mitigating these

376
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,320
leaks are

377
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
represent some major research questions

378
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
in privacy preservation of machine

379
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
learning

380
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,079
many research problems have tried to

381
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
propose attacks and defense mechanisms

382
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
to preserve privacy and machine learning

383
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
modes

384
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,880
but one important challenge is that if

385
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
we can obtain a model

386
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
that generalizes well to the whole data

387
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
population

388
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
and at the same time be privacy

389
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,000
preserving

390
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,439
is still to some extent and unknown

391
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
and if so what would be the leaks

392
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,359
through such model

393
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,839
well maybe the information about the

394
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,880
outliers

395
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
which means those part of the so-called

396
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,799
long-tail distribution

397
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,679
which patterns do not blend well into

398
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,559
that one of the rest of the population

399
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,640
the question the paper in this

400
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,240
particular paper is in fact

401
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
answering is closely related to the

402
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
relationship between

403
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,320
generalization and privacy

404
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,160
so in a nutshell the paper is really

405
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,600
providing a sound

406
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
thorough and rigorous approach to show

407
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,520
that generalization

408
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
is in fact happening because the model

409
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
is memorizing data

410
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,559
which as you may have understood by now

411
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:54,960
is

412
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
against privacy

413
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,919
so i personally believe the paper's

414
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,480
major contribution is showing a new way

415
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
to understanding the many different

416
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,160
trade-offs of accuracy

417
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,039
privacy and to some extent fairness for

418
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,840
long-tail

419
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
data distributions and deep neural

420
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,679
networks

421
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,559
so on behalf of the pat awards committee

422
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,480
i'm really delighted to present this

423
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,559
award to victor lee feldman

424
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,720
author of this paper with contributions

425
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
that have

426
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
already inspired significant additional

427
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,919
research in the area since its

428
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,799
publication

429
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
about a year ago and is very very likely

430
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,000
to have

431
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
further impact on not only the

432
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
theoretical research

433
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
but also the applied algorithmic

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,039
improvements

435
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,960
and applied machine learning based

436
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
research in general

437
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,679
and the ai applications design this will

438
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,760
bring additional practical impact to

439
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,799
this rigorous

440
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
theory focused contribution again

441
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,080
thank you vitaly for this outstanding

442
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,679
piece of research

443
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
and congratulations

444
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,559
hi thank you can you hear me as well

445
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,000
yes yes oh okay awesome

446
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,520
okay thank you yours yes

447
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
thank you for the kind words simone and

448
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
palace and and

449
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
and uh for this great summary

450
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,320
unfortunately i guess the speaker is not

451
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,880
uh

452
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
yeah here but anyway i thank you for it

453
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
uh of course i would like to start by

454
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,600
thanking the pets awards

455
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,760
awards committee for honoring my work uh

456
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
with this award

457
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
also thank you for sending me uh this

458
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
beautiful trophy

459
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
uh it uh it has very much impressed my

460
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
kids and and they started to believe

461
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,720
that i'm doing something

462
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,080
important at work my my parents were

463
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
also very quick to volunteer space on

464
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
their shelves for it so it's

465
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
again something that is worth a lot to

466
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,200
me

467
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,039
i'd be delighted to get an award for any

468
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,640
of my works but this work is quite

469
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,520
special for me

470
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,480
uh and it's actually one of my favorite

471
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,520
ones

472
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
and so the recognition it received from

473
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
the committee and this community

474
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,039
are especially dear for me uh

475
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
one thing that makes it uh this works

476
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,799
special for me is that it combines my

477
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,360
two

478
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
main research interests machine learning

479
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,480
uh theory

480
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,559
and uh data privacy uh the motivation as

481
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,720
has been mentioned in the summary comes

482
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,440
from from this empirical observation

483
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
about deep learning algorithms

484
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,039
uh that has been puzzling me for a while

485
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
they have this very large

486
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
difference in training and um

487
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
test error with training error being

488
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,760
often zero

489
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
close to zero but test error could be

490
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
very high 30 40

491
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,480
percent uh and in a recent couple of

492
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,120
years this

493
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,799
this question has been public puzzling

494
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,120
many uh many other people has been kind

495
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
of on the mind of the entire

496
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,400
machine learning theory community uh so

497
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,320
while this question comes from

498
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
machine learning the key idea for this

499
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
paper

500
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,159
actually came from my work on data price

501
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,240
or thinking about data privacy

502
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,039
uh several of my colleagues ulvar

503
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,880
lingson nicolas carlini and

504
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,840
nicolas were trying to understand

505
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
various measures

506
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
of hardness of training examples

507
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
including hardness for training

508
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
by differentially private algorithms

509
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,640
like what makes a

510
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
uh an example hard to predict for

511
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,640
differentially private algorithm

512
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
and their empirical results clearly show

513
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
the differentially private algorithms

514
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
cannot classify correctly

515
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
rare and highly atypical examples many

516
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
of which were not similar to any other

517
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,919
examples in the data set

518
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,520
basically due to their privacy

519
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
preserving properties differently

520
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
private algorithms cannot learn from

521
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
unusual things that you only see once

522
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
uh and and other things that i've

523
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
noticed that there are lots of such

524
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,159
examples in a typical data set

525
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,919
and this is kind of known to

526
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
practitioners as

527
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
uh informally as data distribution

528
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
having a long tail

529
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
and it seems that differentially private

530
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
algorithms are specifically struggling

531
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
with this

532
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,280
with this long tail which basically led

533
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,559
me

534
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,320
to realize the significance of these

535
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,360
atypical examples for learning

536
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,720
and also their other property that

537
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,520
such examples that you only see once can

538
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,000
be

539
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
hard to distinguish from examples that

540
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
are outliers mislabeled something that

541
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
kind of not really useful

542
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,159
for learning uh but because you can

543
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:26,880
distinguish

544
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,000
between those in order to uh achieve

545
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,360
high accuracy uh and uh on this rare and

546
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
a typical example in the

547
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
long tail you also need to memorize a

548
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,240
lot of

549
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,280
outliers which causes this large

550
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
um generalization gap this difference

551
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
between the errors and explains

552
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,200
and answered that question that has uh

553
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,360
puzzled me

554
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,880
and the thing and the second thing that

555
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
makes this work one of my favorite ones

556
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,080
is that i actually

557
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
it actually changed how i myself think

558
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
about uh data and machine

559
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
uh learning uh the application

560
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,039
there are for example applications for

561
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,600
some notions of fairness uh

562
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,280
uh that kind of came to me pretty soon

563
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
after

564
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
uh thinking about this but others have

565
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,799
also been building on insights

566
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,559
in this in this work

567
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,400
uh so i'm sure that the recognition and

568
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
honor given by this award will help

569
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,159
spread these ideas even more

570
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,840
and so i'm deeply grateful to this

571
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
community for this award

572
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
very much hope to see you all in person

573
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,799
next year

574
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,840
thank you again sorry for the noise

575
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,159
i guess we don't have another sound

576
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,080
effect for another round of applause

577
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,120
and we also hope to see you next year

578
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,960
um let us close this session uh

579
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,000

spend hours and hours of the precious

590
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720

papers but also

604
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,559
regarding the whole process and

605
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
if it weren't without if it weren't for

606

like to extend my thanks and

616
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,799
gratitude to my co-chair simone

617
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,840
who will be stepping down from

618
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,320
the pet awards committee so simone it

619
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,200
was a true

620
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
pleasure and i really much

621
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,600
i really appreciated your guidance

622
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
through this process thanks very much

623
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
and the round of applause for simone for

624
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,240
one more contribution to the community

625
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,159
all right excellent so that's it simone

626
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,799
do you want to have the last word

627
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
yes no i also otherwise thank you

628
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,080
everyone for

629
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,799
very happy about the outcome and that we

630
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,120
have

631
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
the great papers and also so good

632
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
nominations this year so it was very

633
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,080
competitive

634
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,760
there were many more papers that um

635
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,720
were perceived very positively so and

636
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,039
please also nominate for next year when

637
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,600
panos continues to be the share with

638
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,200
and yeah the award committee also

639
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,120
relies on excellent nominations

640
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,840
yeah thank you

641
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
so

642
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,600
[Music]

643
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,039
i think your heart muted

644
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,960
decorate we can't hear you

645
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,360
refreshed i guess yeah

646
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,399
can you hear me now

647
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,840
can you hear me now yes okay

648
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
fantastic all right so i'm going to be

649
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,039
opening up

650
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,960
the closing session of pets

651
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
and let me share my screen so

652
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,919
congratulations to

653
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,240
it's the fourth time that a vitali has

654
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
won

655
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
and it is the also the fourth time that

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
someone has scooped the entire cash

657
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,799
prize so congratulations

658
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,159
all right so uh normally the

659
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
um the pc chairs have

660
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,120
the privilege of closing and uh florian

661
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,840
will be

662
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
closing with some acknowledgements and

663
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,159
some additional information but there's

664
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,080
a few things that is general chair

665
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
um taking the liberty of saying

666
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,760
so first of all thanks to this is a

667
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,080
subset of the volunteers

668
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
some folks from rit some folks from

669
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,279
waterloo

670
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,200
and we have casey from nyu we have

671
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,279
uh cider also helped with some of the

672
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,320
building but they

673
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,240
were also all of these folks were

674
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,080
helping with

675
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,960
being the technical chairs running the

676
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,320
video and

677
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,799
uh helping just the guides and in

678
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,440
working at the information desk

679
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,360
a big thanks to our sponsorship chairs

680
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,600
susan mcgregor and stephen murnock

681
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
not only did they help us get money that

682
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,440
helps run the

683
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,039
conference at a lower cost to all of you

684
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,480
but it uh they helped us navigate

685
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,279
some interesting and tricky uh

686
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,880
situations about whether we should

687
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
accept money from certain

688
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440

753
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,559
great to have him on the team

754
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,840
we've got max the cruise director

755
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,440
saying max was there to help

756
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,960

757
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,320
make had exciting fun event for

758
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,799
everybody

759
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,720
so big thanks to him

760
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,760
we have john the wizard sober barty john

761
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,080
would have uh john put together this

762
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
image of

763
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,480
of himself no i'm kidding he would be so

764
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,360
embarrassed if

765
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,960
to put together such low quality work

766
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
the john did

767
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,559
basically was capable and did almost

768
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,679
like everything

769
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,399
in terms of putting all of the event

770
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
pieces together

771
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,200
and it would have been easy to just keep

772
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,840
giving him

773
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,320
all the work um but then i would have

774
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,679
also prevented him from doing the

775
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,919
research that i'm asking him to do so

776
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,159
fortunately we also had the fourth and

777
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,000
definitely last but not least

778
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,760
final person in the list ben

779
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360

780
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,320

781
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,000
putting all the things together

782
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,679
but was also doing it all from the wrong

783
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,000
time

784
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,279
zone so a big thanks to ben

785
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,559
and it's good to know that without

786
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,799
spoiling too much information that ben

787
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,600

um finger lakes region to

798
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,760
see some of the gorges and then

799
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,200
maybe stop at some of the places where

800
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,760
some of the wineries for wine tasting or

801
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,120
two or three

802
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,279
and so some of these things that we

803
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,080
couldn't enjoy this time at pets

804
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
but hopefully at some other time we'll

805
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,919
be able to do that

806
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,840

816
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,839
