00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,560
hi and welcome to this talk on the

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,040
validity and reliability of the internet

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,600
users

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,760
information privacy concern scale iuipc

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,519
my name is thomas gross i'm from

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,280
newcastle university in the united

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,559
kingdom

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
let us first consider the impact of

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
measuring privacy concern

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
instruments measuring privacy concern

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,800
are an important ingredient

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,279
in investigating antecedents of privacy

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,720
behavior

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
they are also crucial for investigating

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,080
the privacy paradox

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
that is the attitude behavior dichotomy

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,440
we find in privacy research

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
in developing the internet users

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
information privacy concern scale

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,640
iuipc and hot red all considered

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,480
information privacy concern

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
as an individual's subjective use of

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320
fairness within the context of

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,960
information privacy

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
io ipc 10 is one of the most used

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
privacy concern scales it has a

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,760
reputation to be

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
diligently created in an evolutionary

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,879
fashion

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,520
and it has a sound theoretical

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,880
underpinning and its content validity

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,400
in this table i'm giving a brief

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
overview of internet users information

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
privacy concerns

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
are your ipc 10 it's a 7 point likert

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,520
scale

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
anchored on strongly disagreed to

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,119
strongly agree

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,560
you can stop the video and read the

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
scale at your leisure

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
now what is the aim of this research in

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
this talk i'm focusing on the construct

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,360
validity and reliability of iuipc

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,159
and this considers multiple aspects

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,119
first

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,439
we're looking at factorial reality and

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,400
unit dimensionality of subscales

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
second we are investigating convergent

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,360
and discriminant validity

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
and third we are considering internal

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,079
consistency as a reliability notion

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
now the paper also concludes an

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
investigation of content validity that

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
is relevance and representativeness of

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,759
the content in the questionnaire

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
and an estimator appraisal which is

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,119
which

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
estimators in confirmatory factor

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
analysis are best suited to

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
use with iuipc

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,560
let's have a look at how we investigate

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
construct validity and reliability

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
first of all validity means whether an

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
instrument measures what it purports to

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
measure

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,440
for construct validity we first of all

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,920
have factorial validity which means the

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
factor composition and dimensionality

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
are sound so that means we are testing

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,959
goodness of fit hypotheses

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
and metrics secondly we're looking at

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,959
conversion and discriminant validity

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
which means items belonging to the same

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
factor are meant to relate to each other

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
and items that do not are meant not to

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
relate to each other

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,200
finally we have a number of criteria

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
that we use to evaluate whether

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
we have a sound construct liberty or not

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
and that is that the standardized factor

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
loadings better are greater than

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
17. so it's a variance extracted

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
is greater than 50 percent uh and that's

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,159
the heterotrade monotrade ratio

85
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,000
hdmt is less than 0.85

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,319
now we are considering as reliability

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,920
the extent to which a variable is

88
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,640
consistent with what is being measured

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,560
and that could also be considered as a

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,720
capacity to separate signal from noise

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
reliability for us means especially

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
internal consistency

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
and one of the tools we're using for

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
that is called generic reliability omega

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
it's amount of general factor saturation

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
we're also considering the average

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
variance extracted

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,159
ave which is the average of the squared

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,680
standardized loadings belonging to a

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
factor

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
now for those we are expecting that

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
congeneric reliability omega is greater

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
than or equal

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
dot 70 and that the average variance

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,000
extracted is greater than 50 percent

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,439
we are first considering the common

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,280
factor model and

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,840
uh the foundations of confirmatory

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
factor analysis we use in this research

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
i'm using a metaphor here that was

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
created by sasha s-camp

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,079
imagine we are attempting to measure

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,560
the unobserved latent variable solar

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
irradiation

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
we do this by creating indicator

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
variables

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,759
which reflect the impact of that latent

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,479
variable

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
and here also the thermometers we might

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
not just have one of those

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,160
but multiple indicators reflecting

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,280
the latent variable these indicators are

123
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
also impacted

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
by error variance that we are putting

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
into the model as well

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,759
now as analogy for privacy concern

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
the latent variable would be privacy

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,560
concern or one of its subscales

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
and the indicator variables are the

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,400
items in the questionnaire

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
now it's all about measuring variance

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
and covariance between

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
different indicators and

134
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
what we seek to find is a common

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
variance that is attributed to the

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
latent vector

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
in addition to that we have unique

138
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,759
variance which is composed of the

139
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,440
specific variance

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,919
of the indicator and the area variance

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,840
let's take a look at the procedure of

142
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
the study

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,240
so first of all we had the data

144
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
preparation phase

145
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,680
looking at completeness attention check

146
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,039
distribution outliers and so on

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
we then conducted a primary confirmatory

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,440
factor analysis

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,360
on our base sample which allowed us to

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
investigate whether we have validity and

151
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,960
reliability

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,720
for iuicp in the first place

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
then we had a phase of diagnosis

154
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,160
in which we investigated its factor

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,440
structure further

156
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
in which we looked at the reliability

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,759
and the possible respecification

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,960
and this we considered

159
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
with the base sample as well as with an

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
auxiliary sample a

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
finally we had a validation phase in

162
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,199
which we

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,600
checked our findings on an independent

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
sample to make sure that our findings

165
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,799
are actually holding up

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
now i've been stressing that we had

167
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
three different samples for that

168
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,240
and i'm going a bit more into that so

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,319
first we had a base sample

170
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,240
which was our main sample for the

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
confirmatory factor analysis

172
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
so that is the sample which was of at

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
the foundations of our research

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
now to make decisions about

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
possible problems about diagnosis

176
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
of what is going on and get an

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
independent information source we had an

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,039
auxiliary sample

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,039
that helped us to make these decisions

180
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
finally we had the validation samples

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
that we didn't touch until we

182
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,840
decided how we would respecify some

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,400
models

184
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,560
or iuicp and then use that to check that

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,840
our findings are actually holding up

186
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,880
here i'm giving a brief overview of the

187
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
three

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,919
samples we have the samples

189
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
base and validation on the right hand

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,880
side over here and they were acquired

191
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,919
with prolific

192
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,800
and meant to be representative of the uk

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
population

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
in terms of age distribution and gender

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,960
distribution

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,280
sample a so auxiliary sample here was

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,878
not meant to be representative

198
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,759
let's have a brief look at distribution

199
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,280
across samples

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
naturally iocp yields ordinal variables

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
with seven levels

202
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,199
it comes at no surprise that those on

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
distributions are non-normal

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,720
that they are substantially negatively

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,599
skewed

206
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,120
and that they are partially left to

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
kurtic

208
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
now these observations have consequences

209
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,000
in what

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
estimators one would use for

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
confirmatory factor analysis

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
and you find more on that in the paper

213
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,840
when it comes to construct validity

214
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,240
by looking at factorial validity under

215
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,440
an mlm robust estimation as a baseline

216
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,919
for all the different models

217
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,200
i'm giving you the factor loadings

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
um over here as a context for that

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
now what we found was that the goodness

220
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,800
of fit with the chi

221
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
squared was statistic significant that

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
is not supporting the model

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
so compared to fit index cfi was.92

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
also not in favor of the model and then

225
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,600
um the matrix would mean square estimate

226
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,839
of

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
approximation ramsey m was at dot 10

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
and the standardized root mean squared

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,959
residuals where dot 10 as well

230
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
both of those metrics are indicating a

231
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,360
poor fit

232
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
now what we see from that is that we

233
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
have a poor global fit

234
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
and that none of statistical hypotheses

235
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
we use to evaluate that

236
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
yielded support for the model

237
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
in addition to that

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,200
we had a poor local fit which we found

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
in the

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
correlation residuals and in the

241
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
statistically significant standardized

242
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
covariances

243
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,360
so overall this indication of

244
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
considerable misloading

245
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,959
so while we could find evidence to

246
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,279
support the three-dimensionality of iocp

247
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,399
at the same time the subscales

248
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
the unit dimensionality of the subscales

249
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,880
was disconfirmed

250
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
now this plays into the evaluation of

251
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,399
convergent

252
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
discriminant validity where we're

253
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,959
looking at the standardized loadings

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
so we're starting this convergent

255
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
validity and here we find

256
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
that for the

257
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
factor collection things are looking

258
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
good however

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
for the factor awareness

260
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
um we have awareness three um with a low

261
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
standardized loading and for the

262
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,399
effector control we have control three

263
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
whistle low standardized loading

264
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,240
so our criteria for those nameless that

265
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
we have a requirement of a better

266
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
greater than 0.70

267
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,040
are not fulfilled

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
now this has direct implications in the

269
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,440
sense of

270
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,240
that these indicators only exhibited

271
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
less or equal than 20 percent of the

272
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
common factor variance which is

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
problematic for our convergent

274
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,760
validity and finally

275
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,120
for both of those factors control and

276
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
awareness we found that the average

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,839
variance extracted was less than 50

278
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,560
as well which means that you have less

279
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
variance extracted than

280
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
uniqueness than error variance present

281
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
as a consequence we needed to put a

282
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
convergent validity of the scale in

283
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
question

284
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,000
now these results remain similar for the

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
base sample as well as for the

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,560
validation sample

287
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
since that's something that's holding up

288
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
for the discriminant validity we looked

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
at correlations

290
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
um and said we find that we have

291
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,600
considerable correlation between

292
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
indicators across factors

293
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
so where we would normally expect as we

294
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,279
have in

295
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
collection over here since the

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
indicators have a strong correlation

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,760
within the vector

298
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,240
boundaries and little correlation to

299
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,120
other

300
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,760
indicators we don't quite see this as

301
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,399
strongly

302
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,440
in control and awareness

303
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
and for that reason the

304
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
fauna lacquer criterium was fulfilled on

305
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,880
the main sample but not in the

306
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
validation

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
and the htmt criterion was

308
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,880
was fulfilled

309
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,880
now what we find here is that the

310
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
discriminant validity is borderline

311
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
acceptable

312
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,639
and given that the validation sample

313
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,040
showed a failed test on that

314
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
it's always something i would want to

315
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
check

316
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,639
now when it comes to reliability i'm

317
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
drawing attention to the signal-to-noise

318
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,920
ratio as one way of looking at that

319
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
now what we have found is that the

320
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,639
congeneric reliability omega

321
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,000
was below the threshold.70 for

322
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
control and awareness which would

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,000
indicate

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
a failed reliability criterion in itself

325
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,560
now this also implies that we have a low

326
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
signal to noise ratio for these two

327
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,600
factors

328
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
and that causes some problems now

329
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,440
what you see in this graph over here is

330
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
the signal-to-noise ratio falls

331
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,079
different vectors

332
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,560
and what i'm pointing at on the

333
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
left-hand side here

334
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
is a signal-to-noise ratio for the

335
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,639
factor collection

336
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,360
um which is actually doing quite well

337
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
however for the factors control and

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
awareness the signal-to-noise ratio

339
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
drops considerably

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
and that can cause problems the

341
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
consequences are as follows

342
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
there is a considerable amount of

343
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
specific and error variants that may

344
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
master two privacy constraint scores

345
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,279
you investigate this iuicp

346
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
now the low reliability implies that

347
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,240
there is an attenuation

348
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,079
of the impact of privacy concern on

349
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
other variables so this means that the

350
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
magnitude of the measured effects

351
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
of privacy concerns on other variables

352
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
such as behavior for instance will be

353
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,600
reduced and this in turn is undermining

354
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
our investigation

355
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
of as a privacy paradox and that is one

356
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
of the main concerns

357
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
i want to convey with this talk

358
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
we attempted to alleviate that situation

359
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
by re-specifying iuipc

360
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
we created a compact version of io ipc

361
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,240
we call io ipc

362
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
8 in which we eliminated indicators with

363
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,839
minimally acceptable loading

364
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,600
such as control 3 and awareness 3.

365
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
now this clearly comes with a trade-off

366
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,720
you gain a better fit

367
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
better conversion and discriminability

368
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,920
as well as

369
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,720
internal consistency we can show that

370
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,360
the fit is

371
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
statistically significantly better with

372
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,800
the wrong nested likelihood ratio test

373
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
on the other hand we lose information

374
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
we're having two fewer items in there

375
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
and we have a risk of non-identification

376
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,079
because of two indicator factors

377
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
now if you're comparing the

378
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
iuipc 10 version the original and i o

379
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,839
ipc8 this is the following

380
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
you have i ipc 10 over here with both

381
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,760
samples

382
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,800
b and v and i ipc 8 below

383
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,440
again with two samples now for the

384
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
factorial validity

385
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
um both samples um fail to show that

386
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,000
the model is sound um

387
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,600
for io ipc 10 and we have problems with

388
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
conversion validity

389
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
as well as a bit of a toss up for

390
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
discriminant validity again reliability

391
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,079
internal consistency has failed here

392
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,040
now for i o ipc 8 the situation looks

393
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,560
slightly differently

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
so on the one hand we have a better

395
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
situation in terms of the fit

396
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,920
not perfect for the base sample still

397
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
we're getting much better metrics on

398
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
this we have a good

399
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,480
convergent and discriminant validity as

400
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,279
well as a

401
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,800
sound internal consistency so in that

402
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,600
sense the

403
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,480
io ipc 8 gives you better metrics to

404
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
work with

405
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
when i first investigated io ipc i found

406
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
that it had a lot

407
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
going for it especially it has strengths

408
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
in its underpinning and content validity

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,920
that is in relevance and

410
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,759
representativeness of its content for

411
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,320
the question at hand

412
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,639
also the proposed three-dimensionality

413
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,519
of the

414
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
scale seems to be adequate

415
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
still we couldn't confirm i or ipc 10

416
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,480
mostly based on the problems in

417
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
construct validity

418
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,959
and that finds expression in

419
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
unsatisfactory

420
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
global and local fit in the questionable

421
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
unit dimensionality of the subscales

422
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,560
awareness and control

423
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,160
and the problems in convergent validity

424
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,880
now it's especially important to

425
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,839
consider the

426
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,480
impact of low reliability on the

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
attenuation

428
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,599
of relations to other factors

429
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,599
that means that the measured effect size

430
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
between privacy concern and other

431
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,199
factors such as behavior will be

432
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,480
diminished

433
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
hence if we're investigating the privacy

434
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,000
paradox

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,880
the attitude behavior dichotomy you

436
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,679
might not see

437
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,600
effects that are actually there because

438
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,320
of this attenuation

439
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,080
that means if we really want to

440
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
investigate the privacy paradox properly

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,679
we need to have

442
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
valid and reliable privacy concern

443
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
scales instruments

444
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,799
to investigate this

445
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
finally and we've proposed an

446
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
alternative to i you ipc 10

447
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,640
a compact version called ipc8

448
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
it gives you increased validity and

449
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,640
reliability that's the price of a

450
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,080
trade-off towards

451
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,559
reduced information and less redundancy

452
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,678
in the scale
