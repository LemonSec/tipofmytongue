00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,319
hi my name is alexandria leclaire

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,080
today i will be presenting the work by

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,759
myself and my co-authors

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
glencora boradale kelsey kretschmer and

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,679
michelle gradys

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,719
on the use and adoption of pgp encrypted

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,919
email by activists

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
though the united states is often lauded

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,039
for the first amendment right of free

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,680
speech

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,519
there's a long history of that right

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,199
being restricted for members of

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,000
organized activism

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
activist communication has been targeted

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
for over a hundred years

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
during the palmer raids law enforcement

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,239
raided the offices

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
of labor organizers in order to seize

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
paper documentation and literature

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,440
as communication has evolved so is the

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,600
interception of that communication by

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
law enforcement

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,239
during the civil rights era phone lines

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,719
began being tapped by law enforcement

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,800
and now in the modern era internet

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
communication

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,879
sees hashtags like black lives matter

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,520
used by

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
modern civil rights activists being

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
tracked by law enforcement

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
privacy in online communication is

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,960
currently an open

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,240
problem research focuses on the views

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,799
practices and threat models of the

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,240
general population

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
or the average user however

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
for general users privacy is framed as a

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,759
matter of principle

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,000
rather than as a necessary protection

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,119
measure

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
and while this is probably true for a

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
lot of average users

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,280
that if their online communication is

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
intercepted or seized by law enforcement

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
they probably will not see direct

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,479
consequences

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,040
of that communication this is another

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,280
matter for a population of activists

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
activists adopt a lot of different

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
online communication

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
they use social media for public

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
outreach and pr

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
they need to share and store documents

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,759
online in the cloud

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,399
they use email communication for

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,040
internal communications among members

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
as well as outreach and collaborations

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
with other activist groups

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
we've also seen the rise of messaging

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
apps such as signal

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
become extremely popular in the last

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
couple of years

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,599
though it's worth noting that signal was

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
not widely available or adopted

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
at the beginning of the training period

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,760
in which we sample

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,560
our activists from and as such we were

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,519
not able to

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
investigate signal very extensively

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
within this project

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
email among activists is notable it has

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,360
widespread use and availability

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
it's free it's low resource

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
listservs and mailing lists specify

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,239
interesting parties

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,840
allowing you to tailor your

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,080
communication to specific groups of

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
people

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
as compared to social media where all

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,560
communication

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,959
goes through the same stream and the end

82
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,879
user must pick and choose

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,840
what out of that stream is related to

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
them

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
privacy protections for online

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,879
communication

87
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
are available and have existed for some

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
time

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
end-to-end encryption for email

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
cryptographically ensures

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
that the host of the communication does

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
not have access to the email plain text

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
modernly email is usually encrypted

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,959
on all providers in transit and this

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,200
ensures that third parties cannot

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
intercept communication between the

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,319
sender

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,319
and the receiver and the host however

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,879
in this situation the host still has

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,760
access to the plain text of the email

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,040
an end-to-end encryption email the

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
email is encrypted even while the host

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
has access to it or is serving it

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
and does not have ability to see the

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,239
plain text of the email being sent

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,000
and while these types of email

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,560
applications have existed for a while

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
it's been found that users struggle with

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
these applications due to usability

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
issues

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
the johnny can't encrypt papers of which

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
there are a series by different authors

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
document the issues that users have with

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
end-to-end encrypted email applications

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
at length

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
on reflection of these papers it

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
occurred to the research team

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
that there exist users with an immediate

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
need for private communication

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
who must work around these usability

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
issues

122
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,000
as the seizure of their email

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
communication

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
could result in consequences if law

125
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,639
enforcement was to get access to their

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,440
communication

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
modern surveillance comes with its own

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
set of problems

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
while previous forms of surveillance

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
required physical access to

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
communication infrastructure modern

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
surveillance is streamlined through

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
often cooperative or at the very least

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,560
complacent platform hosts

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
we saw this through the snowden

136
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
disclosures which went into detail about

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
the cooperation

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
between communication hosts such as

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
facebook and google

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
and their allowing of law enforcement

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
access to their end user data

142
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
additionally legal parameters around

143
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,320
email

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,199
are antiquated these legal parameters

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,320
are based on

146
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
previous server infrastructure that was

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,440
easier to draw a direct analogy to

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
physical mail

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
in which law already surrounded what was

150
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
adequate

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
search and warranted search by law

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
enforcement

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
however with the changes in modern email

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,240
infrastructure this allows for extensive

155
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,400
access via modern email servers

156
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
the actual technology is not the only

157
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
obstacle to

158
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
secure and private communication there

159
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
are a number of interesting social

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
factors that arise when trying to use

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
communication technology in a private

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,479
way

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,560
technology use is subject to the network

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,759
effects in which

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
a communication platform is only as

166
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,600
useful as the number of

167
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
other people that you can also

168
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,160
communicate with on that platform

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,199
a communication platform can be as

170
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,000
secure as possible but rendered useless

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
if no one

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,759
has the ability or is willing to use

173
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,960
that communication

174
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,720
platform to communicate with each other

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
there are also some unique social

176
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
factors that have been shown to arise

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,319
when a group of people use secure

178
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
communication users worry that they can

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,759
seem

180
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,599
paranoid or untrustworthy if they opt to

181
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,160
use

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
end-to-end encrypted communication at

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,160
all times

184
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
this leads to users being selected and

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
picking and choosing

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,319
what types of data gets encrypted this

187
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,479
can lead to leaks of data as well as

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
error in what is encrypted and what is

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,599
not encrypted

190
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,800
in day-to-day communication with all of

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,919
this in mind

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
we sought to answer the question how do

193
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
users with concrete privacy threats

194
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
respond in the long term to training

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,080
that aims to

196
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,800
overcome the documented usability issues

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,599
of pgp email encryption

198
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
we surveyed participants of a private

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,280
email workshop

200
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
participants were taught how to use the

201
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,759
thunderbird email application

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
with the enigmail extension which

203
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,039
provided

204
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,160
end-to-end encrypted email participants

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
were recruited

206
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
6 to 40 months after attending a

207
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,639
workshop

208
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
these participants were largely

209
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
environmental and social activists

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
and their involvement with research

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,039
requires careful consideration

212
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,000
risk can be associated with research and

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
this can be

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
due to either the inability to ensure an

215
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,520
anatomy

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
of participants on part of the

217
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,120
researchers

218
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
or the collection and improper storage

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,840
of sensitive data

220
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,520
additionally these groups rely on trust

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
relationships to ensure that they're not

222
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,879
putting themselves

223
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,080
and their teammates at risk so we must

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,399
take

225
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,479
utmost care in ensuring that these

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
participants data stays

227
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,279
secure and private

228
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
as such when we recruited participants

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
we sent pseudo-anonymous links to a

230
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
qualtric survey

231
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
we also offered them pjp refreshment

232
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,279
training

233
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,399
after one month of deployment

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
we recruited in total for the analysis

235
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
19 participants nine identified as

236
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
men eight as women and two as gender

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800
non-conforming or genderqueer

238
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
the majority were aged between 30 and 39

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
and the table below shows the overall

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,680
distribution of ages that we recruited

241
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,160
all of our participants identified as

242
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
being on the political left

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
we asked them to self-identify and they

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
self-identified as center-left to far

245
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
left

246
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
the analysis we deployed for this study

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
was qualitative comparative analysis

248
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
it's often abbreviated as qca and i will

249
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
probably slip to referring it as such

250
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
in the following slides there are two

251
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,519
forms but for simplicity

252
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,800
here we used crisp set themes are

253
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
encoded as a binary variable

254
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,560
as existing or not existing for example

255
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
the response to the question are you

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
part of a community of people

257
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,399
who use technologies for secure

258
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,600
communication

259
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
is encoded as one if the response is yes

260
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
and zero if no

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
additionally one of these binary

262
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
variables is determined to be the

263
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,519
outcome

264
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
this binary variable is the one in which

265
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
a cause is being examined this is akin

266
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
to the dependent variable in statistical

267
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,360
analysis

268
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,160
here we encoded the question continues

269
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,720
to use

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,720
pgp encryption encoded as encr

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
as the outcome with yes being 1 and no

272
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
being 0.

273
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
qca evaluates a truth table of these

274
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,959
binaries

275
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,839
values performs a boolean minimization

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
to output which variables appear with

277
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,040
the outcome

278
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
after this it outputs a logical formula

279
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
that represents the relation

280
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
between the variables and the outcome

281
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
it's important to note here

282
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
that qca is not equivalent to

283
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,079
statistical analysis rather qca provides

284
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,120
a framework

285
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
which allows for reliability in encoding

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,160
of qualitative themes

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
it allows for some sort of

288
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
reproducibility and

289
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
tracking of which themes are related to

290
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
the outcome

291
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
and which are related to the negation of

292
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,760
the outcome

293
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,399
through qca we found the following

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
logical formula

295
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,959
in plain text we found that participants

296
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
who adopted pgp in the long term

297
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,880
found pgp easy to use and either

298
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,880
were individually motivated to adopt pgp

299
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
or they found pgp easy to use and did

300
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,040
not engage in

301
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
activism or engaged in low-risk activism

302
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,680
qca does not assume symmetry between the

303
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,279
positive outcome and the negative

304
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,040
outcome for example

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
variables that result in a positive

306
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
outcome cannot just be

307
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
negated to result in the negative

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
outcome the negative outcome has to be

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,920
analyzed

310
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,040
independently here we found that

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,079
participants who did not adopt pgp

312
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
either found pgp difficult to use and

313
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,079
either

314
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
belonged to a community using other

315
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
secure communication tech

316
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
or found pgp difficult to use and

317
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
engaged in high risk activism

318
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
additionally we also found a formula

319
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,399
in which participants who did not adopt

320
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,519
pgp

321
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,160
were not individually motivated and

322
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,160
engaged in high high-risk activism

323
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
risk is of interesting note in our

324
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
results especially because it

325
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
contradicts what might be a common hope

326
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
in security research security research

327
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,600
we would hope that users would develop a

328
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
threat model

329
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,639
and that those engaging in riskier

330
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
behavior take precautions based on that

331
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
threat model to mitigate risk

332
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,320
however what we found is our higher risk

333
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,040
groups

334
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
were less likely to use end-to-end

335
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
encrypted communication

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,920
however we can think of a couple of

337
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
logical reasons why this may be the case

338
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,279
these users may be less risk-averse in

339
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,240
general

340
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
both in their activism and in their

341
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,279
communication

342
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,680
they may be willing to take more risks

343
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,880
in the types of

344
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
activities they participate in and as

345
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,880
such also with the types of

346
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
communication they employ

347
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,560
additionally these higher risk users may

348
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
avoid technology altogether

349
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
as technology itself cannot be

350
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
guaranteed based on our knowledge of

351
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,959
what law enforcement has

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,240
the ability to crack the existing

353
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,120
evaluations of pgp encrypted email

354
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,760
focused on usability and on a user's

355
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
first encounter with the process

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
and therefore their learnability with

357
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,360
the ui elements of the applications

358
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
here we've examined how a specific

359
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,160
demographic those involved with activism

360
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,519
adopt pgp in the long term

361
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,079
usability concerns absolutely need to be

362
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,040
addressed

363
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
instead here we investigate those with

364
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,120
an immediate need and a threat model

365
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
better necessitating

366
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
end-to-end encryption than the average

367
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
user

368
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
we recommend that future work focus on

369
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,880
the use of signal

370
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
and newer end-to-end encrypted

371
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,040
applications which did not exist through

372
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,079
the training period

373
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,359
in which we recruited from

374
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,000
in addition this study was exploratory

375
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
and more qualitative

376
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,360
we do not prescribe that our findings

377
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
here be generalized to

378
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,519
all users that may encounter end-to-end

379
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,720
encrypted email

380
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
or even all activists who need to use

381
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
end to end encrypted email

382
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
instead we're providing an account of a

383
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,639
phenomena

384
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,680
that we think is counter to

385
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
the use of a general or non-specific

386
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,519
user additionally our recommendations

387
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
for future work suggest that while

388
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
future improvements are necessary

389
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
we need to support those with an

390
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
immediate need and focus on meeting the

391
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,760
needs of

392
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,519
this specific user base before i end

393
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,760
i want to leave with a quote from victor

394
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,720
papanek

395
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,839
from his book design for the real world

396
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,199
you
