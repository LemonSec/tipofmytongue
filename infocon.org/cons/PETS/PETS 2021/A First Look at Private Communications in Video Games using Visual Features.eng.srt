1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,879
hi everyone uh we'd like to present our

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,439
paper

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,680
uh first look at private communications

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,160
in video games using visual features

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,639
uh my name is taha ali we are from the

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,840
university of

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,200
national university of sciences and

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
technology from pakistan

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
and we are very very happy to be here

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,119
this is the first time

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,920
right a small primer on video games it

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,880
is a huge

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,760
industry there's an estimated 2.7

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,599
billion gamers worldwide

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,560
immensely popular past recent surveys

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
show that about 60 percent of americans

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,960
play video games on a daily basis

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
video games have immense cultural impact

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
as well they're bigger than hollywood

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,719
they give rise to closely knit

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
communities through rich subcultures

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
and lately we've even even noticed that

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,160
politics and activist trends have

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,879
started to

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,120
surface in video games so there's an

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
example here which is from last year

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,480
so you might recall there were quite a

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,879
few protests happening in the last year

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,559
and because of the pandemic a lot of

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
these protesters a lot of people

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
they had virtual protests and games like

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,239
the same

33
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,360
animal crossing second life etc last

34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
year we also had the

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
biden harris presidential campaign they

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
purchased an island in animal crossing

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,439
and people politicians now do

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
conduct campaigns online in video games

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
and it got to the point that nintendo

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,119
actually had to come out with a press

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,560
release and say that please don't bring

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
politics into the game

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
so the question we're specifically

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
interested in is can video games be used

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,640
as

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,640
privacy enhancing technologies

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
so there is quite a bit of work done on

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
this which goes back several decades

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
we've had there are three main

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,159
strategies and these are the strategies

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,159
you encode messages and strategic moves

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,960
of the game

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
so if alice and bob want to communicate

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
via via a game

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
they have a dictionary both of them and

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,399
every move they make corresponds to a

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
certain entry in the dictionary

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
which decodes into certain useful

59
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,360
information so that's been demonstrated

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,399
for several games

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
covered channels have been demonstrated

62
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,880
in quake 3 arena and in 080

63
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,960
stegnography has been demonstrated for

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
solitaire pac-man

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,520
bong tetris team fortress 2

66
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
so you insert your message you hide your

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,878
message in

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
the actual data communications of the

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
game itself

70
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239
now what these works have in common is

71
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,200
that

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
generally they require game clients to

73
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
be customized they require the

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
exchanging of dictionaries for

75
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
certain cases users have to be

76
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
relatively sophisticated

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,239
these channels have typically very low

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
bandwidth so they are recommended to

79
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
maybe bootstrap secure communications

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
somewhere else or for micro blogging for

81
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
twitter style messages

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
for public posts that kind of thing the

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,599
threat model is

84
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
common in the sense that the channel or

85
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
the dictionary that itself is the secret

86
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,560
once that is revealed

87
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,200
everything else is out in the open so

88
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,760
the

89
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
aspect we intend to explore is can we

90
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
communicate using visual features in the

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
game so as you might be aware games are

92
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
becoming more immersive now and you have

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,760
greater flexibility in manipulating the

94
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,640
environment

95
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
so can you use that and can you

96
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
specifically

97
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,319
do that in such a way to evade automated

98
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,120
detection

99
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
because tech spotting in the wild is

100
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,319
recognized to be an open and challenging

101
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,959
problem

102
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,640
so we we believe we're the first to look

103
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,879
at uh video games from this particular

104
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
perspective

105
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,159
so here's how it would work if alice and

106
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,440
bob want to communicate

107
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
let's say in grand theft auto 5 that's

108
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
an action adventure game

109
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,200
alice picks up a gun and she finds the

110
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
surface and she dies

111
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
she fires her message on the wall right

112
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
i think therefore i am

113
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,159
if it's a strategy game like let's say

114
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,680
clash of clans where you have to arrange

115
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
structures or buildings

116
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
you can do that to spell out your word

117
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
or your message

118
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,599
hello world in this case now again this

119
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,200
can be used to bootstrap communication

120
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
channels to share links for door bridges

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,519
for micro blogging digital graffiti

122
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,959
and that's actually a very relevant

123
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
example uh if you look at this

124
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,640
this is graffiti which was witnessed in

125
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
istanbul in 2014 on several walls

126
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
in 2014 for the general presidential

127
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
elections

128
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
turkey banned the turkish government

129
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
banned twitter

130
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,239
and users soon discovered that it was a

131
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,159
very simple dns block and you might

132
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,920
recognize the ip address here this is

133
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
the ip address of google's dns servers

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
so once people entered this information

135
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
onto their computers then they could

136
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,639
access twitter all over again

137
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,840
so something like this could easily be

138
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
done in a game and it took us about five

139
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
to ten minutes to do something like this

140
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
this is in grand theft auto 5

141
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,840
right so our contributions are we

142
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
in our paper we demonstrate that state

143
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
of the art text spotting tools fail to

144
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,919
detect

145
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,639
text in popular games and we'd explain

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,600
why

147
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
and then we retrain these tools for

148
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,639
specific environments for these

149
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
particular environments and we show that

150
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,160
performance improves but in very limited

151
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,280
ways

152
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
and we demonstrate techniques which can

153
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,639
defeat

154
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,040
tools that have been retrained so these

155
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,080
rely on

156
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
inherent design limitations of these

157
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
tools of tech spotting technology

158
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,639
and we in our paper we also propose

159
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,400
certain mechanisms to improve efficiency

160
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,120
secure

161
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
security and bandwidth

162
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,000
so a quick primer on tech spotting tech

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
sporting in the wild is recognized as a

164
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
challenging problem

165
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
like i mentioned by the computer vision

166
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
community

167
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
the reason is that unlike tech spotting

168
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,080
in other

169
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
environments like let's say documents a

170
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,600
document is very orderly it is very

171
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,479
uniform

172
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,080
the background is white there's only

173
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,479
text it's very structured

174
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,720
but in the wild things are not that

175
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,000
straightforward there can be lots of

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
background objects that can be a lot of

177
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
clutter

178
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,160
the fonts can be written in strange ways

179
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
the fonts can have lots of curves

180
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
lighting makes a difference

181
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
perspective especially it warps the

182
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
geometry of the scene what is being seen

183
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,080
so

184
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,440
if you look at text from a particular

185
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
perspective it can be much much harder

186
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
to recognize

187
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,800
so we use four state-of-the-art tech

188
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
spotting tools for our

189
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,199
uh work here so two of these the first

190
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
two deep tech spotter and abc net

191
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
are from the academic literature they

192
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
are the leading tools

193
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,000
and the other two tools are proprietary

194
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
tools google cloud vision azure cloud

195
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,160
vision

196
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,919
they are online services there's very

197
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,840
little literature about them available

198
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,199
but all four of these tools are

199
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
recognized for extremely good

200
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
performance on benchmark data sets

201
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
so they are acknowledged by the computer

202
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
vision community

203
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
to be state of the art and this is how

204
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,080
they work

205
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
so this is native text within the game

206
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
grand theft auto 5 native texas text

207
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
which is already there

208
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
we did not put this text it was already

209
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
there in the game and when you run the

210
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,600
tools over it

211
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
uh these text spotting tools so you can

212
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
see that they've accurately

213
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
identified the they've localized the

214
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
text in the bounding box the red

215
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,039
bounding box and they've also

216
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,759
highlighted

217
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
what the word actually is so these tools

218
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,680
are extremely effective

219
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
for text spotting in the wild

220
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
now for our experiments we had to come

221
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
up with an all new data set because

222
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
there's no such data set of text

223
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
generated in games

224
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
we modeled our data set on the street

225
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
view text

226
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
data set which is a classic data set in

227
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,479
the vision community

228
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
our data set is actually we've released

229
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
it it's released to the public

230
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
it's we've shared a github link in the

231
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,360
paper the

232
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
street the original street view text had

233
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,639
street view images with

234
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,080
signs on billboards and

235
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,759
signages and everything was labeled so

236
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,440
it had 350 images

237
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,599
904 words about 2047 characters

238
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,639
so we replicated this data set for three

239
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
three different games and we also for

240
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
controls purposes we also included 50

241
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,919
images of native text from within games

242
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
50 images of arbitrary shape text text

243
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
with fancy fonts different types of

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
curves

245
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,080
and we took images from different

246
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,199
perspectives three different

247
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
perspectives for each word

248
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
and it took six students approximately

249
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,879
250 hours to do this

250
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,919
over two months so so this is again the

251
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,039
effort it took us was

252
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,520
immense because the uh unlike a normal

253
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,800
data set where you just take pictures

254
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,919
and you label them

255
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
we had to go into the games and actually

256
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
physically generate these words and

257
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
uh that takes it takes about 10 to 20

258
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,319
seconds to generate a single character

259
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,759
not a word a character

260
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,479
so it took us a lot of time to do this

261
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,000
and these are the games

262
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
grand theft auto 5 call of duty 4 and

263
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
minecraft two of them

264
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
grand theft auto 5 and call of duty 4

265
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,319
are similar minecraft is a completely

266
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,639
different genre

267
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,440
and overall um so these are the most

268
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,479
popular games

269
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
in the world right now they regularly

270
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,679
clock in about

271
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,799
uh over over a couple of

272
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,279
uh 100 million users on a monthly basis

273
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,680
and this is what the this is just to

274
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
give you a flavor of the data set so in

275
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
the first column if you look you've got

276
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,920
the street view text

277
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
original images you've got target and

278
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
murphy written down

279
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
and we recreate target and murphy in the

280
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
second column for gta 5

281
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
grand theft auto 5 for call of duty and

282
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,839
for minecraft in the very last column

283
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,800
these are the results of the tools so

284
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
when you when we run this on the data

285
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
set you'll observe in the second

286
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
third and fourth column that performance

287
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
is pretty poor

288
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
for deep text spotter in abc net it

289
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
clocks in at zero they don't recognize

290
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,399
any of the text azure cloud vision the

291
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,600
last row is

292
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
less than one percent google cloud

293
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
vision does better it goes up to almost

294
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
six percent for the case of minecraft

295
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,440
but otherwise the performance is still

296
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
negligible but on the other hand if you

297
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
look at the last two columns

298
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
the native text within grand theft auto

299
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
5 performance is pretty good

300
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
it goes up to 85.6 percent for azure

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
cloud vision

302
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
and for the very last column on the

303
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
original svt data set

304
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
as your cloud vision goes up to 91.8

305
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
percent it recognizes most of the words

306
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
almost all the words so what we're

307
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
seeing is that these

308
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
text spotting tools they do work in the

309
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,720
wild

310
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
as you can see in the last column they

311
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
do work on text which is actually

312
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,200
already in the game

313
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,399
which is the second last column but they

314
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,079
failed to recognize texts which we

315
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,320
generate in the games ourselves what

316
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
could be the reason for that

317
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
so here we try we attempted an

318
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
explanation from the computer vision

319
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,800
literature

320
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
so this is what a standard font looks

321
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
like standard piece of text so you've

322
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,200
got two

323
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
two properties which stand out a

324
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
continuous boundary

325
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,959
and a uniform structure homogenous

326
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,279
strokes

327
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,160
now when you break up the boundaries

328
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,600
when you come up with discontinuous

329
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
boundary this is called an

330
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,160
led font you might have seen it in

331
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,079
billboards and in sign

332
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
signage when you break up the boundaries

333
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
when you have discontinuous boundaries

334
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,399
this is recognized to be a problem

335
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,160
because now the search space to find the

336
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,640
right

337
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
character that increases significantly

338
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,519
and when we push it one step further

339
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
when we come when we uh come up with a

340
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
non-homogenous structure when we

341
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
as we do with the case of bullets then

342
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,839
it becomes extremely challenging because

343
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,240
now

344
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
it's not entirely clear to the tool

345
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
which component or which part of this

346
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
picture is part of the background and

347
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
which is part of the actual text

348
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,959
and how does it all fit together so that

349
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,120
is why our performance for these tools

350
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
is so poor

351
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,880
so we retrain these tools for we've got

352
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
the pipelines for deep tech spotter and

353
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
abc net are open source so we can

354
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,399
retrain these tools entirely for these

355
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,279
games

356
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
and we notice that deep deck spotter

357
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
improves marginally it goes up to

358
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,720
between six and seven percent

359
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
abc net improves significantly it goes

360
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,600
up to 64.67 percent

361
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
and the reason for this we believe is

362
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
because abc net is specifically designed

363
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:35,839
to

364
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,079
accommodate a slight amount of curvature

365
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
in the text

366
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
and we look at one other interesting

367
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
result from here uh which is that

368
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,360
uh we try to see what is the can these

369
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
results be generalized

370
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
i mean can i train uh can i retrain

371
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
a tool for one game and use it to detect

372
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
text in another game

373
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
how would that work what kind of result

374
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
would i get so here as you can see for

375
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,279
the case of call of duty 4

376
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,639
if you uh improve if you retrain abc net

377
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
performance improves to 42 but when you

378
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
use that same tool in gta

379
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
5 performance is between 10 and 20

380
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,279
percent

381
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
likewise for gta 5 if i if i retrain abc

382
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,240
net i go up to 64.67

383
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
but when i use that same tool retrain

384
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
tool on call of duty 4 performances

385
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,079
between 10 and 20

386
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
so the benefit is marginal it's not that

387
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
significant and none of these results

388
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
generalize to minecraft because

389
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
minecraft is a completely different type

390
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,639
of game with different textures

391
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,399
perspectives and materials

392
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,560
and another problem that we see is that

393
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,519
uh

394
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,680
all of these detectors fail when you

395
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
generate arbitrary shape

396
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
text when you have a significant amount

397
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
of curvature in the text

398
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,600
so we can read this text fairly easily

399
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
but all four detectors

400
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,639
trained retrained the two detectors that

401
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,680
we've retrained

402
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
all of them failed to recognize this

403
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,760
text because this is an inherent design

404
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
limitation of text spotting technology

405
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,959
that it cannot handle

406
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,119
advanced amount a large amount of curves

407
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
a quick word on adversarial capabilities

408
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
here

409
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
so we're nearing the end so what we have

410
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,279
here is the standard prisoner warden

411
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
scenario that's the threat model that we

412
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
have where

413
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
alice could be in prison who wants to

414
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
communicate with bob on the outside

415
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,880
and eve in our case is the warden who is

416
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
inspecting all messages that go from

417
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,240
alice to bob

418
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,720
and in our case eve is automated because

419
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
uh video game traffic is

420
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,279
fairly significant it's one of the

421
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,880
largest components of internet traffic

422
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,920
as a whole

423
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
so it's not possible for humans to

424
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,199
surveil all of it but

425
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
in this case our warden could be it

426
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,880
could be a normal

427
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
it could be a hacker it could be a

428
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
network administrator working for an

429
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
organization or a company

430
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,800
uh she could be someone working for a

431
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
gaming company like maybe nintendo who

432
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,079
wants to see what kind of communications

433
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
are happening between players

434
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
or she could even be working for an

435
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
intelligence agency

436
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,880
now what we've seen so far is that these

437
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
automated tools they fail

438
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,040
out of the box they can't the results

439
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,680
they do not recognize any of the text

440
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
you can retrain them but that has high

441
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
costs and effort

442
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,040
and the benefits are very limited they

443
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
don't generalize much

444
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,040
and they can still be defeated by

445
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,360
arbitrary shape text

446
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
so many of these many of our

447
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,279
adversarial models actually might not

448
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,399
have the

449
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,240
resources to do to undertake this

450
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,600
exercise like a normal network

451
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
administrator or a hacker cannot come up

452
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
cannot do the whole

453
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,320
it would be quite a bit of effort to do

454
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
the whole retraining exercise

455
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
or for a game company but when we come

456
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
to the intelligence agency model things

457
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,279
become very

458
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
uh interesting because these agencies

459
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,560
have incredible resources they can come

460
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
up with huge data sets

461
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,839
our data set was between three to four

462
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,600
thousand images they could easily come

463
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
up with data sets of

464
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
tens of thousands even hundreds of

465
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,079
thousands of images

466
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
and uh they could even come up with they

467
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
could even push the state of the art in

468
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,360
terms of technology they could

469
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
they could come up with uh text spotting

470
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,560
tools which

471
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,120
can handle curvature so that's entirely

472
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,079
possible

473
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
and there is a slight precedence for

474
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
something like this so this is a news

475
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
item from the snowden leaks

476
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
uh which was about and this news item

477
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,079
came on about seven eight years ago the

478
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,639
nsa

479
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
actually spied on world of warcraft and

480
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
xbox online games

481
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
and uh gchq

482
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
actually went to the extent of designing

483
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,440
customized tools to parse

484
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
traffic for world of warcraft and to

485
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,880
access the

486
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,279
voice communications of players so

487
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
something like this could be done and

488
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,839
there has been

489
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
such an activity in the past

490
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
and if these companies if these entities

491
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,160
do have these types of resources

492
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
they could even go one step further they

493
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,360
could skip

494
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
automated tools entirely and they could

495
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,399
just put human agents in the game

496
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
because human agents can see

497
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,040
this and can recognize this kind of text

498
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,800
and again we have a precedence

499
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,480
in the snowden leagues the nsa actually

500
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
infiltrated world of warcraft

501
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
and it's actually very interesting

502
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,360
because it's not just the nsa

503
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
gchq the fbi the cia and one or two

504
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
other such agencies

505
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
they all sent agents into games because

506
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,800
they were convinced that there might be

507
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
terrorist communications happening

508
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
inside games

509
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,800
and then it got to the point that the

510
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
agents were tripping on each other's

511
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,959
feet

512
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
and then they had to set up a special

513
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
committee to sort of

514
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,920
harmonize the operation so that they

515
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,399
don't sabotage each other's intelligence

516
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
activities so this could be done

517
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,720
so this is a new area the way we see it

518
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
our work is sort of a first step there's

519
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
a lot more work that needs to be done we

520
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
need more data we need more tools

521
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,320
we need more experiments we need more

522
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
input from the computer vision community

523
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
on what can be done and cannot be done

524
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,120
in this domain what we're working on so

525
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,480
far is we're trying to improve the

526
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
usability of this technique we're trying

527
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
to automate it so that it

528
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
it's not so painstaking to type in the

529
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
words

530
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,079
i'll leave you with just uh some just a

531
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,480
comment for food for thought so future

532
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,679
trends what we're seeing is tech

533
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,880
spotting tools are

534
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
improving every year if you go to cvpr

535
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,480
you

536
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
find a new tool which has extremely good

537
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,839
performance

538
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,880
but at the same time video games are

539
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,240
also improving they're becoming even

540
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
more immersive and you're getting

541
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
greater flexibility and greater control

542
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,799
over the environment

543
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,240
how you can manipulate objects and what

544
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,480
you can do so which way

545
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,400
things will swing how this cat and mouse

546
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
game will go

547
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
that remains to be seen so that's pretty

548
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
much it if you find this topic

549
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
interesting there's a lot more work in

550
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
our paper there's a lot more results we

551
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,520
couldn't fit in because of time

552
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,799
constraints

553
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,600
we are happy to take questions uh that

554
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
is it for now from our end

555
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
uh thank you for listening thank you for

556
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,400
your time take care

557
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,360
bye
