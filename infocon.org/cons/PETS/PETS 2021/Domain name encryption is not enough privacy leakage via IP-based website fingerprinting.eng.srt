00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,280
hello everyone my name is fong i'm a phd

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
candidate at stony brook university

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
today i will be presenting our paper

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,160
with the title

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,000
domain name encryption is not enough

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
privacy look at sphere ib based website

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,440
fingerprinting

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
this is a joint work with researchers at

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,880
stony brook university

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
and umass amherst online surveillance is

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,560
prevalent

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,640
and most internet users are not aware of

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,039
privacy and security risk when using the

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,080
internet

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
so when it comes to surveillance chinese

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,359
is one of the most

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,599
notorious countries that has been making

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,520
use of technologies for large-scale

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,320
surveillance

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
even in many western countries including

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,800
the us where privacy laws have been

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
long established online surveillance by

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,079
private companies

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
is still an ongoing problem so

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,280
online surveillance has led to severe

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,879
violations of many

27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,120
human rights including the rights to

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,640
privacy

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,039
and as for a result more and more

30
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,480
network traffic

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,039
get encrypted on the internet to improve

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,039
the security and privacies for internet

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,320
users

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
just to give a sense of how encryption

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,760
has increased over

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
the years this plot shows that all

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,479
traffic of major google services

38
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
are now encrypted with some of them were

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,400
not widely encrypted just

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
five years ago here is another picture

41
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,439
from the internet acquire projects

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,680
showing that almost ninety percent of

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
urls probe by this project

44
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,799
starting with uh https this is an

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
increase from just about 20 five years

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
ago

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,479
so this increase of encrypted uh traffic

48
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,479
is thanks to the free to us certificate

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,759
authorities like

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,479
less encrypt as you can see just within

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,759
the last five years

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,360
less encrypts has issued a free

53
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,119
certificate for

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,840
almost 250 million fully qualified

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,560
domains

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
and this is an amazing scale for free

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,399
service because certificates

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,159
used to cost money and regardless of the

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,360
expansions of

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
https traffic context domain names are

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,159
the last piece of unencrypted

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,119
information

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,520
that is still largely visible on today's

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,560
internet

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,959
so where is domain name information

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,679
disposed

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
this line shows us the common places

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
where domain information can be

69
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,400
monitored

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
by an unpacked observer so

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
these are the packets captured when

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
visiting

73
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,599
example.com the first place where the

74
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,560
domain name

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
example.com exposed is through the dns

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
query and response

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
and after getting back the ip address of

78
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,160
example.com

79
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
the client initiates connection support

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,280
443

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
and starts the 2s handshakes protocol

82
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
this is the second place

83
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
where domain information is exposed this

84
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,319
is because

85
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,200
the ts handshake takes place before the

86
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
actual encryptions happens

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
and therefore exposing the domain name

88
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,599
information in one of the 2s extensions

89
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,640
called

90
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,400
server name indication so the exposures

91
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,040
of domain

92
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
information in these two channels have

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
led to many security and privacy

94
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,959
problems for example domain names often

95
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,519
reveal

96
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,280
some semantic information about the

97
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
website being visited

98
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
for instance your online shopping

99
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
preference or maybe health conditions

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,959
religions gender identity or even worse

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
sexual habits

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
and since the traditional designs of dns

103
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
is in plain text

104
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,200
this information has been given for free

105
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
to any unpacked observer

106
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,959
for example internet service providers

107
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,879
can use this information for targeted

108
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,239
advertisements

109
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,480
and that's why when domain encryption is

110
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,360
proposed

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
there has been some prospects from many

112
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,239
internet service providers

113
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
so let's discuss in more details about

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,760
encryptions

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
which includes several proposals and

116
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,519
implementations

117
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,720
first we have dlt in which dns queries

118
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,799
and responses are transmitted through

119
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
a tos channel with doh

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
another implementations of dns

121
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
encryptions the

122
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
it performed over https and therefore

123
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
inheriting

124
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
all security benefits of the https

125
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,040
protocol

126
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,760
and starting from ts version 1.3 the

127
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
server name indication extensions

128
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,920
in the client hello during the twist

129
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
handshakes can be encrypted too

130
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
with this proposal the domain name

131
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,639
information in both dns and 2s

132
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,320
traffic can be secure and in the new

133
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,880
setting

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
the users and the dns resolver first

135
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,160
establish

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
an encrypted channel which could be over

137
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
https or 2s

138
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
after that dns queries and responses are

139
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,560
sent

140
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
over this channel and during the 2s

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,080
handshake

142
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,639
unlike in previous versions uh from

143
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440
version 1.3 the server name indications

144
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,479
um can be encrypted and this news

145
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
proposal prevent

146
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
any unpacked observer from seeing the

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
domain name information

148
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,320
however ip address of the destinations

149
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
web server is still visible to the

150
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,320
observer

151
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,600
and this motivated us to investigate

152
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
whether domain encryption actually

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
improved privacy

154
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
or not in particular we investigate

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
the extents to which browsing tracking

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
and scale is still possible

157
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
based on the relationship between domain

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
names and their hosting ib addresses

159
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
we are still visible to any unpat

160
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,039
observers and the extents to which this

161
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
inference can be met depends on two

162
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,479
factors first

163
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,560
whether the domains are co-hosted with

164
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
many other domains on the same ib

165
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
address or not

166
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
second the stability of mappings between

167
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,919
domain names and their hosting ip

168
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,639
addresses over time

169
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
so to track online activities of

170
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
internet user when all network traffic

171
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
is encrypted website fingerprinting

172
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
is often employed website fingerprinting

173
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,720
is a type

174
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
of traffic analysis attack which is used

175
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
to construct fingerprints

176
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
for a set of websites based on the

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
traffic pattern observed

178
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
while browsing them and depending on

179
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
which metadata is visible from

180
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
the encrypted traffic different

181
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
techniques can be used to determine

182
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
whether a user visited any of the

183
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
monitor websites

184
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
and as ip address information is still

185
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
visible we introduce

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
a lightweight website fingerprinting

187
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
technique that allows a

188
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
network level observer to identify with

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
high accuracy

190
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
the website a user visits based solely

191
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,160
on the ip address information

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
so this is an overview of our method

193
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
which i will walk through

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
step by step in the next coming slides

195
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
so first for our test list

196
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,520
we curate by getting a hundred thousands

197
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
most popular domains from the tranquil

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,080
list

199
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
we then complement it by also taking a

200
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
hundred 126 000 sensitive domains

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
from the alexa list the rational here is

202
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
to have a balance

203
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,919
among different types of websites and to

204
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
not only consider popular website but

205
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,639
also

206
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,960
the sensitive ones and in total we

207
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
crawled 220

208
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
000 websites and of which we could

209
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
successfully grow more than

210
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
208 000 websites this is because some

211
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,479
website

212
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,800
was not responsive at the time of our

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
study

214
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,720
next when crawling this 220 000 websites

215
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
we extract the domain names contacted to

216
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,520
download the web resources

217
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
this make a set of unit domains

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,919
for its website that we call a domain

219
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,759
based fingerprint

220
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
this is an example of a domain based

221
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
fingerprints for twitter.com

222
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,840
which include two parts the primary

223
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
domain which is

224
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
the one that we type in the url bar

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
and the second part is a set of

226
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,520
secondary domains

227
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
which are contacted to download all the

228
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
web resources for rendering

229
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,560
the website on our computer screen

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
so from the domain name collected we

231
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,400
then conduct

232
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,039
dns resolutions to obtain their hosting

233
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,479
ib addresses

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,039
we repeatedly conduct dns resolution to

235
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,000
capture

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
all possible ib addresses of the domains

237
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
this is an example of domains to app

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,879
mappings that

239
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
we have collected with each ip address

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
is shown as an integer here so for

241
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,639
instance we observe

242
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
four different ip addresses for the

243
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
domain twitter.com

244
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,680
and similar for other secondary domains

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
we then construct the ib

246
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
paste fingerprints from this domain

247
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,479
based fingerprint

248
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
the first part of an ib based

249
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
fingerprint is a set of ip addresses

250
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
of the primary domain and then the

251
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
second part of the ip based fingerprint

252
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,560
is a set of ip addresses of all

253
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,640
secondary domains

254
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
so as an onpad observer we then sniff

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,839
for ip addresses contacted

256
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,640
when each website is visited for

257
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,200
instance

258
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
this is the sequence of unit ib

259
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
addresses captured

260
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,920
when twitter.com is visited

261
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
and now to identify which website the

262
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
sequence of ip address

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,040
captures above belong to we scan

264
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
that sequence of ips against the sets of

265
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
ib based fingerprints that we have

266
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
constructed

267
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
so we first scan the first ip address in

268
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,839
the sequence

269
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,160
again the primary ip address in the

270
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
fingerprints

271
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
and if there's a match we continue

272
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,880
scanning

273
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
the second part of the fingerprint for

274
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
matching secondary ip address

275
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
to find the best matching fingerprint in

276
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
our initial work

277
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
we know that many websites are hosted

278
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
on an ip address that does not host any

279
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
other websites

280
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,680
for instance these are such websites and

281
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
this includes some

282
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,720
very sensitive websites so

283
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,279
when a primary domain is single hosted

284
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,320
on one ip

285
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
or multiple ips without sharing the

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,839
hosting servers

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,680
with any other domains it is

288
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
straightforward to infer

289
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
the website being visited so we have

290
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,880
shown

291
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
in two slides before of how we match the

292
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
fingerprint

293
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
now if a website is single hosted we

294
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
only need to scan

295
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,000
and match the primary ip address

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
and from our data we find that 52 of

297
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
websites studies have their primary

298
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,480
domains hosted on

299
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,600
their old ip addresses and as a result

300
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
an adversary could already infer 52

301
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
of the targeted websites based solely on

302
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
the ip address

303
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
of the very first connections to the

304
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
primary domain without having to

305
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
consider the secondary connections

306
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
and then by also considering secondary

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,720
connections

308
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
we obtain an increased matching rate of

309
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
84 percent

310
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
among the fingerprinted websites we

311
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,000
could match

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
92 percent of popular and 78

313
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,079
of the sensitive websites a more

314
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,399
worrisome results here is that

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
95 percent of sensitive and popular

316
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,920
websites can be fingerprinted

317
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
and until now we have put all of the

318
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
secondary connections

319
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,160
into one set which does not have any

320
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
order

321
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,519
however when viewing the whole rendering

322
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,320
process

323
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
there is a loading order which we can

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
rely on to cross their connections into

325
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,839
groups

326
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
and this orders is no critical rendering

327
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,440
path

328
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
in other words there are some critical

329
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,279
web resources that must be loaded before

330
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
some other resources

331
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
and as you can see in this example there

332
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,560
are

333
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
three clusters of connections and

334
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,480
these clusters are closely related to

335
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
the critical rendering paths

336
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
which each cluster happen after a

337
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
specific rendering event

338
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
in the browser so clustering connections

339
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,160
like this

340
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
helps improve the fingerprint

341
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
discriminatory capacity

342
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
and here is how the enhanced ib based

343
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
fingerprints would look like

344
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
from the domain based fingerprint

345
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,160
that has been clustered we then obtain

346
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
the enhanced iv based fingerprint which

347
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,279
looked like

348
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,720
this and for the sequence of ips threads

349
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,040
uh

350
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
captured from network trees we use

351
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
k-means clustering

352
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
cluster them into three clusters based

353
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,079
on the time

354
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,519
when each connections were initiated

355
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,480
and then we scanned this sequence of ip

356
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,120
address

357
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
against the fingerprints that we

358
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
constructed

359
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
we first scan the primary connections

360
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
and then the first cluster of

361
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
connections

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,000
followed by the second cluster and

363
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
finally the third clusters

364
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,839
this is similar to walking through a

365
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,120
decisions tree

366
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
and this enhanced fingerprinting

367
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,399
techniques helps

368
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
increase the matching accuracies so with

369
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
that technique we can improve the

370
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,639
accuracies to 91

371
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
for the popular and sensitive websites

372
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,360
we obtain an accuracy of 96

373
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
and 87 respectively an

374
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,279
alarming result here is that 99 of

375
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,320
sensitive

376
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
and popular website can be precisely

377
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
fingerprinted

378
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
posing a serious privacy risk to their

379
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
visitor

380
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,680
and to examine the stability of our

381
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,279
fingerprints we conduct our

382
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,760
measurements in a longitudinal manner

383
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,800
for two months

384
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
and we show that our enhanced ip based

385
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,160
fingerprints

386
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,120
are still effective at identifying about

387
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
70

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,200
of tested websites and to evaluate the

389
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
robustness of our fingerprinting

390
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,519
technique

391
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,519
we next consider a more realistic

392
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,639
scenario in which

393
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,680
http catchings is taken into account

394
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
and we find that an accuracy of 80 can

395
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
still be obtained

396
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
when a website is revisited within just

397
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,560
five minutes from the first visit

398
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
meaning that most web resources are

399
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
loaded from

400
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
the browser cache next to simulate the

401
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,279
use of ad blocking wood is

402
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
often used by many privacy conscious

403
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,959
users nowadays

404
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,360
we also conduct our experiment with the

405
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
brain browsers

406
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,440
and as a result add and tracking domains

407
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
at blocks

408
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
leading to change in the loading orders

409
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
of web resource

410
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
and fewer observable ip connections

411
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,760
however we could still obtain

412
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,639
an accuracy of 80 when employing the

413
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
basic fingerprint technique

414
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
in which the ordering structure of

415
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,000
loaded web resources

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
is not considered so a key take away

417
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,399
from our study

418
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,560
is that regardless of the increasing

419
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
trend of co-locations

420
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639
on the web domain name encryptions

421
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,760
cannot provide

422
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
meaningful privacy benefit with the

423
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
current degree of

424
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
domain co-hosting since the ip address

425
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,079
information

426
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,279
is still visible to any onpad observers

427
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
and that information can be used to

428
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
infer the website

429
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
being visited allowing browsing tracking

430
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
at scale

431
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
to that end we make the following

432
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
recommendations to improve the privacy

433
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
benefit provided by domain name

434
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
encryptions

435
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
first the full domain name

436
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
confidentiality must be preserved on

437
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,639
both dns and 2x traffic otherwise

438
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
neither technology can provide any

439
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
actual privacy benefit if deployed alone

440
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
currently we are seeing a lot of effort

441
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,519
to deploy doh

442
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,839
or dlt by several internet companies

443
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,440
including firefox

444
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
cloudflare google and microsoft however

445
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
to the best of our knowledge esni has

446
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
not been equally considered

447
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
and is is still being developed as an

448
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,959
internet draft

449
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,680
and for domain name owners they can

450
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,240
choose

451
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,399
providers that offer a high co-hosting

452
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
degree per ip address

453
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,560
or highly dynamic domain to iv mappings

454
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,519
and finally

455
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
hosting providers can help to increase

456
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,880
the co-hosting degree

457
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
by grouping more websites under the same

458
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
ip address

459
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,480
and frequently rotate domain to ib

460
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,880
mappings to further improve privacy

461
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,839
benefit offered

462
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
by domain name encryptions and that

463
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,320
concludes my talk and thank you

464
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,519
for your attention
