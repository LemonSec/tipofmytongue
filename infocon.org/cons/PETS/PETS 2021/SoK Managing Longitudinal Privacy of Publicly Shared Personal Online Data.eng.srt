00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,000
hi everyone

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,160
i'm theo and in this video i'm going to

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,600
co-present with shujat our

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,280
systematization of knowledge about

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,280
research related to longitudinal privacy

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
management of publicly shared personal

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,080
online data

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,160
which is joint work also with marcos and

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,720
christina

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
first of all i'd like to introduce our

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
topic and motivate

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,560
why there is a need for effective

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
privacy controls in online environments

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,560
with particular focus on longitudinal

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,880
aspects of privacy

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,960
the number of data people share in

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,239
online social networks

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,719
is simply incredible this talk is going

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,320
to be around 18 minutes long

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,160
and during this time people from all

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,920
around the world are going to share more

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,480
than 1.1 million photos on instagram

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,360
and create more than 10 million tweets

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
within this large amount of data

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
there are many posts that are not meant

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
to be permanent

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,199
to this end many applications already

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
offer options for posts with limited

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
data lifetime

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
for example these platforms here the

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,160
ones i just referred to

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
allow posting contents that are

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
available for 24 hours

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
in addition many posts are not meant to

35
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,920
be seen by everyone

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
which is why content visibility can be

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
limited to specific audiences for

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,479
example followers only

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,720
however the latter one who can see

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,520
content

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
can be either set at the moment of

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
publishing such as posting photo

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,720
or when not manually specified it is

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
defined by the user's default privacy

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
settings

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
the thing is once data is out online

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479
there is usually no adaptions of these

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,040
settings

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
unless the user explicitly revisits and

50
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
manually updates it

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
when we look into research related to

52
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
managing longitudinal privacy

53
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,560
the vast majority of work is either on

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
the user side

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
for example studies about users reasons

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
or perception in the context of data

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,240
sharing

58
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,079
or on the technical side where we see

59
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,520
lots of proposals focusing on

60
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,040
cryptographic aspects of data revocation

61
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
for example one recurring idea there is

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,479
that data is always published in

63
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,680
encrypted form

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
making the decryption key inaccessible

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
after some time

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
however such proposals usually assume

67
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,119
that there are no threats during data

68
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:09,919
lifetime

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
for example that no one will store the

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,400
unencrypted data of the key

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
so far there is no taxonomy taking into

72
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,520
account both

73
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
the usability and the technical

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,879
perspectives

75
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,040
in our systematization we aim to point

76
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
out to what extent users needs are

77
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,959
fulfilled by technical mechanisms

78
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
and to identify potential gaps between

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
those two signs

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
in the first step of our systematization

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
process we collected a large body of

82
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,959
literature from the usability

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,560
and the security and privacy research

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
communities

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,840
we defined a set of categories with

86
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,319
different factors on each side

87
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
for the user side this includes specific

88
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
usage patterns that were studied

89
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
along with drivers for unsharing that is

90
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,920
reasons that people have to reduce the

91
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
availability of their contents

92
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
and desires they have in a datashame

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,280
context

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
on the technical side we categorize

95
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,720
proposals along the use cases they were

96
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,959
designed for the protection mechanisms

97
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,239
that were included

98
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
and adversarial models that you consider

99
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
we align those two categorizations below

100
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
usage patterns on the one side

101
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,159
and use cases on the other side in the

102
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,400
next step we identify conflicts between

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,280
those two signs

104
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
regarding the other properties for

105
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
example when there are specific use of

106
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,120
desires

107
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
that are not properly addressed on the

108
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
technical side

109
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
we distinguish three levels of conflicts

110
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
that is incorrect

111
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,360
incomplete and missing realizations

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
from those conflicts we derived a set of

113
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,959
challenges that are not properly

114
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
addressed from a perspective

115
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,799
we arrange these challenges around four

116
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,080
central themes

117
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
regarding the expiration conditions for

118
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
data data that affects multiple

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
users at the same time we call data

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
co-ownership

121
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
user awareness and security and trust

122
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,200
in the remainder of this talk we are

123
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,720
going to have a look into each of these

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,360
blocks

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,799
starting with the systematization of

126
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
user studies first

127
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,879
in the user studies we considered we

128
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,799
identified five usage patterns related

129
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
to longitudinal privacy management

130
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
the first two are about reducing the

131
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,879
exposure of content in two different

132
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,280
ways

133
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,238
actively and passively users can

134
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,839
actively manage the audience of their

135
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,639
contents

136
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,238
for example limit the visibility of a

137
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,360
publicly shared photo to followers only

138
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
passive methods include removing tags of

139
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,280
other persons from a photo

140
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
which also reduces visibility since it

141
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
will no longer be shown in this person's

142
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,479
circles

143
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
however in both cases the content setup

144
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
is not affected it still remains online

145
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,440
another usage pattern is deleting

146
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
content this is an explicit action users

147
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
undertake such as clicking a delete

148
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,479
button

149
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
as a consequence access to the content

150
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
in social network is removed

151
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
alternatively there's also automatic

152
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
expiration which has the same effect

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
that is content being removed

154
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,240
but without the user being actively

155
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
involved at a time of deletion

156
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
the last usage pattern is deleting the

157
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,199
account which means that not only a

158
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,560
single piece of content

159
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
but all the content a person owns is

160
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,080
removed from the platform

161
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
along with their online identity so in

162
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
total there are three levels of

163
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,239
escalation that have been studied so far

164
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
we identified six drivers for users to

165
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,199
limit the visibility of their content

166
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,880
these include regrets that come up after

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
publishing something

168
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
contents that become less relevant over

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
time and users changing their opinions

170
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,919
about publishing contents without

171
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,400
further specifying reasons

172
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,919
moreover there are cases in which

173
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,919
external events make users revise their

174
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,199
sharing decisions

175
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
misconceptions when the exposure level

176
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
differs from users perceive

177
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,199
when they are explicitly asked about it

178
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
or users expressing fears that specific

179
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,560
groups of people can see their contents

180
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
for their desires users want on the one

181
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
hand the visibility of the contents to

182
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
be reduced over time

183
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
on the other hand they do not always

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,479
want content to expire automatically but

185
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
they also want to be reminded

186
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
such that they can review and confirm

187
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
potential deletion decisions

188
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,120
decisions when it comes to relations

189
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,000
with other people

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
users have some specific desires for

191
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,360
example they would like to be able to

192
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,039
also control contents that have been

193
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,639
uploaded by others as long as this

194
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,680
affects them

195
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
for example when their face can be seen

196
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
on a photo shared by a friend

197
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,960
additionally users express desires that

198
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,759
the audience

199
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,960
for something they share should be

200
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,800
composed differently depending on the

201
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
content they've shared

202
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
related to this there's also a desire

203
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
for user view that is

204
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
a feature where users can view their own

205
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
profile from the perspective of another

206
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
user

207
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
we identified 33 relevant papers that

208
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
contain studies about publicly shared

209
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,960
data

210
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,240
there is only a couple of them

211
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
explicitly asked about longitudinal

212
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
aspects of data sharing

213
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
however also the other papers provide

214
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
useful insight for our systematization

215
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,280
we categorized all papers along the

216
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
different usage patterns drivers found

217
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
sharing and user desires

218
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,759
as explained before for the technical

219
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,280
perspective we follow the similar

220
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
process

221
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
which will now be presented by shujat

222
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
thank you theo for the systematization

223
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,599
of technical proposals

224
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
we start off by considering the use

225
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,240
cases the solutions are designed for

226
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
whether it is the deletion of content

227
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
such that it is no longer publicly

228
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
accessible

229
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,599
or reduction of exposure of content such

230
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
that it is only exposed to a subset of

231
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
audience

232
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
we also capture the number of data

233
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
owners involved as well as their level

234
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,400
of involvement

235
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,560
in the decision to revoke or restrict

236
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,599
access to the content

237
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
we then rate the adversarial model of

238
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
each technical proposal

239
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,039
with respect to the following attacker

240
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
types

241
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
if a proposal considers a specific

242
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
adversary in their threat model

243
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
we label it as such retroactive

244
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,639
adversaries

245
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
learn which data they are interested in

246
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,199
only after the data has been revoked

247
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
so the assumption here is that the

248
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,400
attacker has no

249
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,639
interest in accessing the published data

250
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039
before its expiration

251
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
honest but curious adversaries act as a

252
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
legitimate party in a protocol

253
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
but will attempt to learn as much

254
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
information as possible

255
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
on the other hand interfering

256
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
adversaries actively interfere

257
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
by either pre-phoning or postponing the

258
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,599
data revocation event

259
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,080
and insider adversaries can control user

260
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,879
devices

261
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,800
and can compromise users passwords

262
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,279
to realize these use cases and fulfill

263
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,799
adversarial guarantees

264
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,640
each protocol relies on different

265
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
technical means

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the following protection principles have

267
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
been proposed multiple times

268
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,120
in varying realizations these range from

269
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
cryptographic mechanisms

270
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,440
to deception and flooding to access

271
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,560
control policies

272
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,440
and so on let's now take a brief look

273
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
at the systematization of 35 technical

274
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,160
proposals that we reviewed

275
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,399
i will briefly highlight some important

276
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
trends

277
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
we start off by providing the

278
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,519
publication details along with the

279
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,000
platform

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,959
it is primarily designed for whereas

281
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,880
multiple proposals were focused on

282
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
specific platforms

283
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,959
like facebook or twitter quite a number

284
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
of them were platform independent

285
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,560
as far as the use cases are concerned

286
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
majority of the solutions were directed

287
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
at reducing visibility of the content

288
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
requiring no active involvement

289
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
from the data owners in terms of

290
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
adversarial models considered

291
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
majority of the solutions assume that

292
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
adversaries are honest

293
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
but curious that is they abide by the

294
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,040
protocol

295
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,600
but try to learn as much information as

296
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
possible

297
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
for the protection mechanisms we noticed

298
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,680
quite a few proposals

299
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
relied on both cryptographic primitives

300
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,720
and distributed architectures

301
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,959
in these forgetting schemes encryption

302
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,000
keys are embedded into the stored data

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
in order to prevent single point

304
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
failures these scheme

305
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
avoid putting trust in a central

306
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,320
authority for the storage of keys

307
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
instead they rely on distributing parts

308
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
of the decryption key

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,200
on distributed storage

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
in the backdrop of prevalence of ai

311
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,880
systems such as

312
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
facial recognition adversarial examples

313
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
are increasingly being proposed

314
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,519
to allow users to limit their contents

315
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,200
exposure to these algorithms

316
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
and thus go undetected

317
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
we also witnessed other mechanisms used

318
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,320
less frequently

319
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
some of which include the use of

320
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,839
intermittent withdrawals

321
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,240
to guarantee the privacy of the act of

322
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
deletion itself

323
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
and machine unlearning to teach ai

324
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,560
systems to forget over time

325
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,440
looking at the bigger picture again once

326
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
we categorize the user studies

327
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
and the existing technical proposals the

328
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,399
next step

329
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,880
involved conflict identification across

330
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
these two sides of the story

331
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
starting from the categories identified

332
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,320
in either part of the systematization

333
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,959
we identified potential inconsistencies

334
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,800
between them

335
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,040
pursuing a user-centric approach we

336
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,399
systematically examine

337
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,120
to what extent users desires and their

338
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
drivers for unsharing are reflected

339
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
in the current state of technical

340
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,399
proposals

341
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,720
we identified conflicts whenever

342
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
realizations in technical proposals are

343
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,760
incorrect

344
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,360
that is orthogonal to users desires

345
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
we termed a conflict incomplete whenever

346
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
realizations

347
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
in technical proposals are promising but

348
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
far from satisfying users desires

349
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,680
the last category of conflicts relates

350
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
to missing realizations

351
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
that do not address users desires at all

352
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,000
by combining and contrasting knowledge

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
from both of the obtained

354
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
systematizations

355
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
we first identified conflicts and then

356
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
derived challenges

357
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,839
we followed a bottom-up approach first

358
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,839
we derived fine grained challenges

359
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,079
related to the conflicts and then we put

360
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
them into a broader context

361
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
and related them to each other resulting

362
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,600
in a set of four

363
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
challenge groups as shown here in the

364
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
right

365
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
we will now take a look at some of these

366
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
derived technical challenges

367
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
let's consider an often occurring

368
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
scenario where a social media user

369
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,480
uploads a photo on their profile

370
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
and have two options to choose from to

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
set a time limit for the photo to expire

372
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,720
or to not set an expiration condition at

373
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
all

374
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
in the former case for most end user

375
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,440
solutions

376
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,399
like snapchat there is no flexibility as

377
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:42,720
all

378
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,959
posts expire in the standard 24 hour

379
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
limit

380
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,959
even in the cases of flexible expiration

381
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,760
times

382
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,000
appropriate time for data deletion is

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
often difficult to determine

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,600
in advance in the other case

385
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
where the user does not choose any

386
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
expiration condition

387
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
the context in which data is published

388
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
can change

389
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,079
major life events such as graduation or

390
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,800
moving to a new city could take place

391
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
it is also likely that the post

392
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
sensitivity levels might evolve with

393
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,360
time

394
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
rendering it irrelevant or even harmful

395
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
to the data owner

396
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,639
multiple studies have found that

397
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,720
participants did not want contents to

398
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,519
fade away

399
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
wholesale with age instead they showed

400
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
desire for revocation to take place

401
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,079
for only selected audiences

402
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,560
in contrast the overview of technical

403
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
side shows that the commonly considered

404
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
condition for data revocation

405
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
has been the time passed since

406
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,480
publication

407
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
the dcn on contents exposure control is

408
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,320
a complicated one

409
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,560
hardly captured by focusing alone on the

410
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
age of posting

411
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
to this end we derive specific technical

412
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,800
challenges

413
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
one of whom is to come up with an

414
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
adaptive expiration

415
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,720
condition that takes into account

416
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
contextual factors

417
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,279
such as changes in life circumstances

418
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,040
based on the data available to the

419
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
platform

420
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,519
similarly the other technical challenge

421
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,800
is to fully realize

422
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,440
audience dependent exploration such that

423
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
automated revocation decisions

424
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
do not affect all individual users or

425
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,199
groups of users such as family in the

426
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
same way

427
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,519
now theo will present another set of

428
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,120
challenges

429
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,079
thank you shujaat for data co-ownership

430
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,920
we also identified a set of potential

431
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,120
conflicts

432
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
when uploading a photo showing multiple

433
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
persons such as a group of friends to an

434
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,160
online social network

435
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,240
the photo has one distinct owner the

436
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,399
person who uploaded it

437
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
other people in the photo who are also

438
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
part of the social network

439
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,839
can be tagged in the photo either by the

440
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,560
owner or by the other persons themselves

441
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
or both depending on their privacy

442
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,639
settings that means that the online

443
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
identity a profile

444
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
is linked with a photo owned by a

445
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
different person a friend

446
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
there are a few questions that can arise

447
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
here what can happen next is that

448
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,519
each of these persons can change their

449
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
opinion about the current exposure level

450
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,240
about to whom the photo is shown even

451
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
the relationships

452
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
between those persons can change each of

453
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,680
these implies that there is a need for

454
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
adaptability

455
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
of the current level of exposure

456
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,480
preferably

457
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
for each of these persons regarding the

458
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,240
question

459
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
who of them can take action we see that

460
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,399
the owner is the only one who is in full

461
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,160
control of the photo's privacy settings

462
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
and can for example delete it

463
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
the other two are limited to removing

464
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
their references but have no means to

465
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
make the photo entirely unavailable

466
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
although their privacy set is affected

467
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,759
in the same way

468
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,120
as the owner's privacy so we see a

469
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
certain level of power imbalance

470
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
between users and that should be

471
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,399
addressed

472
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,160
there has already been some research in

473
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
this direction on the user side there

474
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,000
are different mitigation strategies that

475
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,040
have been explored

476
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,199
even though not necessarily focusing on

477
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,199
this exact setting

478
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,000
however when users say that they avoid

479
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
that photos are taken at all because

480
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,880
they cannot control it

481
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
when others share them this shows that

482
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
there is a serious problem in terms of

483
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
power imbalance

484
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
there are different technical proposals

485
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
but those have never been validated

486
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,639
in the sense whether they reflect user's

487
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,360
desires it is not clear if concepts such

488
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
as voting mechanisms or automated

489
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,560
conflict resolution

490
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
can really provide individual users

491
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
their desired controls

492
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
to this end we formulated two challenges

493
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
due to the missing and incorrect

494
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
realizations of user desires

495
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
in the context of controlling others

496
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,880
contents

497
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
adaptability of exposure and handling

498
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
power imbalance are two key challenges

499
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,440
that need further research

500
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
while this was a first glimpse into the

501
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,480
challenges we derived

502
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
there are a couple of more that we

503
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,519
discuss in our paper for example

504
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,040
regarding user awareness

505
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
and security and trust issues we also

506
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
reasoned about further issues

507
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
that we did not formulate as explicit

508
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
challenges but that require attention as

509
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,799
well from our perspective

510
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
in summary we have presented a new

511
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
taxonomy for managing longitudinal

512
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,280
privacy in online social networks

513
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
we have seen several conflicts for

514
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
example that users desire more nuanced

515
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,559
data exploration

516
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,160
or problems with power imbalance in

517
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
multi-user scenarios that are not

518
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,439
appropriately reflected in technical

519
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,640
systems
