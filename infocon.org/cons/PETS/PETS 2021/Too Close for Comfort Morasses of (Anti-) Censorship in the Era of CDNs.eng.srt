00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,080
hello everyone

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,600
i welcome you all to our today's

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
presentation titled as

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,480
too close for comfort morasses of

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,599
anti-censorship

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
in the era obsidians my name is devashes

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,839
yosai

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,080
and this work was in joint collaboration

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,039
with my colleagues

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,680
my mahindra and sampato chakravarti at

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,640
triple iet delhi india

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
internet censorship has always been a

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
point of concern for free speech

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,519
activists

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
this is because it is the control of

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,440
what information

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,239
can be accessed published or viewed in

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,360
the

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,719
internet typically by nation states or

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,000
governments

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
as can be seen in this figure almost all

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,280
countries

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
engage in some form of filtering or

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
surveillance

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,520
across the globe thus

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,440
various popular circumvention systems

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,879
have been proposed

28
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
popular ones being thor and vpn however

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
these proxy based solutions face cat and

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
mouse game

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
as soon as the ip address of the proxy

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
becomes common knowledge

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
it is simply blocked thus various newer

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
anti-censorship solutions have been

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,000
proposed

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
that aim to end the censorship arms race

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
for example required

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,159
but these newer solutions assume

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,360
that a popular web content is hosted

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
outside the census purview for their

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
successful work

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
if we talk about popular web content for

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,479
example

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,200
alexa websites series comes into the

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
picture

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
in last two decades there has been a

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,000
rampant growth

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,399
of syrians over the internet and thus

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,520
alexa websites are replicated across

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,840
multiple geographic location called as

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,000
frontends

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
as can be seen in this figure clients in

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,479
the different parts of the globe

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
rather than communicating with the

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,479
parent website ends up in communicating

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,920
with the frontends

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
likely located near them within their

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,520
own countries

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
thus popular web content example alexa

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
websites

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
are likely proximas to clients

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
geolocation

63
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,840
if this is the case then various

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
anti-censorship approaches that rely

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
on them with the assumption that the

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
popular content is hosted

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
outside the census regime may get

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
impacted

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,680
due to seed in polyphenols the first one

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,519
is required routing

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,760
in require routing various entities are

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
involved that is

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,720
od over destination set of unblocked

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,800
websites that a sensor is not willing to

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,920
block

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,200
cover destination that is those websites

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,480
that a sensor

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
is willing to block and a friendly isp

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that hosts a dr outside the sensors

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,879
regime

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,159
it is a special router

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,959
that is going to be different from the

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,000
normal router

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
in its working it is further assumed

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
that the client is going to send a

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
specially crafted web request

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,519
that would be intercepted by the router

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,000
when it would be going towards the ot

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
the dr would understand

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
that though it is destined to od the

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
intent is to communicate with cd and

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
thus

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
dr with the help of dr proxy fetches the

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,319
content from cd

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,720
and send backs and sends it back to the

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,440
client

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
spoofing the source ip as of the od a

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
pretense is made to the sensor

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,640
that the client is communicating with od

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
but in practice

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,519
it was communicating with cd

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
if the od is hosted within the sensors

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,360
regime

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
the specially crafted web request would

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
not cross the sensor's boundary

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
and would not be intercepted by the dr

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,120
and eventually

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
decoy routing is going to be hampered

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
the other approaches that could be

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,840
hampered are cache browser and cdn

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,000
reaper

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,478
in these approaches it is assumed that

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
the blog websites

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,279
if hosted on a cdn can be accessed via

115
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,440
frontends located outside the census

116
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
boundary

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,160
for example if a client is hosted within

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
the census

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
boundary is located within the census

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
boundary

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
and attempts to access a blocked website

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
hosted on a cdn

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
it would likely be mapped to a front end

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,280
that is located

125
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
near itself within the boundary say with

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
the ip address ip1

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
it is obvious and evident that the

128
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
sensor can trivially block the ip

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
address because it is in its own

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,280
regime however it is assumed that it is

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
not trivial for the adversity to

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,000
enumerate all the different ip addresses

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
associated with different frontends

134
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,039
across the globe and would block them

135
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,280
further if the client in the census

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
regime

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,320
would communicate with its peer outside

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,440
and obtain this iep address out of band

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,120
say by an email the client

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,199
in the census regime can directly

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
communicate with the iep address

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
and can obtain the content

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
but if the website is hosted

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,759
on the anycasted cdn the assumption that

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,600
different front ends have different iep

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
addresses would go

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
and all the front ends are going to have

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
the same ip address

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
in such a scenario client would have no

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,440
option

151
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,840
to send its traffic outside the census

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,639
regime as

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
was the case with the previous dns based

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
cdm thus if

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
a large fraction of the websites are

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
hosted on any carcillions

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
client cannot access foreign front

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
trends and the approaches

159
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
cache browser and cdn reaper would also

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
be impacted

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,600
further the other approach that could be

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
impacted is domain fronting

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
domain fronting is require routing at

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
the application layer

165
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,280
it assumes that different domain names

166
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
can be sent a different layer of

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
communication with the cdn front-end

168
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
and that front-end is going to

169
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
understand that though

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
the client is sending different domain

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
name it's in

172
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,520
its intent is to actually fetch the

173
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
forbidden dot example

174
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,039
for example in this figure

175
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,520
client would send allow dot example as a

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
part of dns query or tls client

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
hello sni field and

178
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,240
to a sensor it would appear that client

179
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,639
is communicating with allow dot example

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
as these two fields are in plain text

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,160
once the secure channel is established

182
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
client is going to send

183
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
its real intent a forbidden dot example

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
in an encrypted

185
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,680
packet the domain fronting supported

186
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
cdn fronted would understand and would

187
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,280
reply with the

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960
forbidden dot examples contained but

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
if the ctn front end is located within

190
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,479
the sensor again

191
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,479
the sensor can coerce as agent provider

192
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,000
to abandon its use

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,319
it is already alleged that roscommon and

194
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
zor the nodal agency in russia for

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
controlling the information within the

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
country has

197
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
coerced some giant companies that were

198
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
supporting domain fronting

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
and as a consequence of coercion the

200
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,160
domain fronting has been abandoned

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,800
further the approaches like covert cast

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
could also be impacted

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
in this approach it is assumed that the

204
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,560
content of the blocked website is

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
transported

206
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,919
via real-time encrypted video streaming

207
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,400
services like youtube

208
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
but if the youtube front-ends are

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
located within the sensor

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
sensor can coerce the youtube to stop

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,800
its

212
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
use this has already been acknowledged

213
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
by the authors in the paper of cover

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,360
text

215
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
if there are enough newer

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
anti-censorship solutions

217
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
that actually depends on the popular

218
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
websites

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,720
we asked this question

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
whether the websites are hosted within

221
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,840
or outside the census regime

222
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,279
and for that we we assumed alexa

223
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,559
top websites as the popular ones

224
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
we resolved the websites and identified

225
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
their ip addresses

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,519
and eventually predicted whether they

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,600
are inside or outside

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
and to geo locate these websites broadly

229
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
there are two approaches

230
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
passive ones that rely on database

231
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,000
up but they are known to errors and the

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,519
other ones are active methods

233
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
that we used and the popular one is

234
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
multi-literation

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,080
in this the position of the target host

236
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
whose geolocation is not known is

237
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,839
estimated

238
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
using distance measurements from the

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,839
sufficient number of fixed reference

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,040
points

241
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
for example in this diagram l1 l2 and l3

242
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
are landmark nodes or the reference node

243
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
is geolocation is already known to us

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
we are interested in geologic

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
geolocating the target ib tau

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,760
the process is very simple at a very

247
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
high level

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,279
l1 will try to estimate the one-way

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,160
delay

250
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
to tau using ping and then it would

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,399
multiply

252
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
the o w d with a speed of light

253
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
constraints a two third

254
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
c and would obtain a radius

255
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
and would construct a circle on the

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,120
world map

257
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,959
where it would assume that the target

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
would be located anywhere within it

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
the same process would be followed by

260
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
other landmark nodes and the

261
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,440
intersection point of all the circles

262
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,959
should ideally the position

263
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
where the target is located but in

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,240
practice

265
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,360
we cannot always get the precise owd

266
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
and very likely we'll get a higher value

267
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
of owd because of congestion in various

268
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
network factors

269
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
and as a consequence we'll end up in

270
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,720
having a larger

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
radius and a bigger circle and rather

272
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
than having an intersection point

273
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,279
we end up with an intersection region

274
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,440
and the centroid of this region

275
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
is assumed to be the target top

276
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,160
however in 2017 previous authors

277
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
demonstrated that even cbg can result in

278
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,440
large errors

279
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
up to 4000 to 5000 kilometers in extreme

280
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
cases

281
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
they concluded the closer the landmark

282
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,040
nodes better the accuracy

283
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,079
thus we adapted cbg for our use case

284
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,519
and called it as rcbg

285
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,360
the goal of the rcbg is to identify

286
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
whether a given ip address is located

287
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
inside or outside the niche

288
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
we selected landmark nodes within the

289
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,839
said country

290
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
because we assume that the target

291
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
ip addresses of alexa websites are going

292
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
to be likely within the nation because

293
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,720
of syrian proliferation

294
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
and those landmarks could be closer to

295
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
them if this is not the case and they

296
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,640
are located outside we handle that case

297
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
as well

298
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,959
that i am going to discuss in the

299
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,040
subsequent slides

300
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,320
notably rather than predicting the exact

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
lag long coordinates of the ip address

302
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,760
we used multiliteration just to predict

303
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
whether the if is located

304
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
in or out of the set country

305
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,720
we relied on four heuristics

306
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
the first two predicts the target to be

307
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
inside and the latter two predicts the

308
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
target to be outside

309
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
for example in this figure different

310
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
landmark nodes are represented at

311
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
circles

312
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
and the target ip is represented as

313
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
cross the circles are going to intersect

314
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,639
and the intersection region is going to

315
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
be formed within the country

316
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
the target type is located with however

317
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
if the intersection region is somewhat

318
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,160
within and somewhat outside

319
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
but major part of the intersection is

320
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,600
within

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
and the centroid also lies within it is

322
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,480
obvious that we are going to predict

323
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
that the target is located

324
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,959
within the country because it has a

325
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,079
higher likelihood

326
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,600
as most of the region is within the

327
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
country

328
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
but if the target iep is located outside

329
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,800
the country

330
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
so somewhere here we'll end up with

331
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,399
having larger values of

332
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
radius and bigger circles and as a

333
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
consequence that the

334
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,519
intersection region is going to be

335
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
formed is going to subsume the entire

336
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
country

337
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
and thus we predict the target ib to be

338
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
out

339
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,200
but again if the intersection region is

340
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,760
somewhere

341
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,200
within and somewhere outside but most of

342
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
the region is outside and the centroid

343
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
is also outside

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
we predict the target ib to be out just

345
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,120
to summarize

346
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,440
for the first two conditions rcbg

347
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
predicts target as insight

348
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
and for the latter two conditions it

349
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
predicts the target to be

350
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,800
outside we used

351
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,320
ripe atlas probes as the landmark nodes

352
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,040
using them we predicted the top five

353
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,000
thousand country

354
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
specific websites to be in or out and we

355
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
did this for five different countries

356
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
india around saudi arabia brazil and usa

357
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,560
as we believe they represent diverse set

358
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
of

359
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,279
in in terms of internet penetration and

360
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
censorship levels

361
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,199
before directly applying rcbg to

362
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,480
estimate the positions of

363
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
country-specific

364
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
alexa websites we calculated its

365
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,399
accuracy

366
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,800
as can be seen uh in this table

367
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,760
most of the nodes that were located

368
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
inside

369
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,440
were predicted as in and the ones that

370
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
were

371
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,639
located outside were predicted as out

372
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
and this was applicable for all the

373
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
different countries

374
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
we selected rye probes with known

375
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
location as targets as a ground truth

376
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
and other ripe lobes as are landmark

377
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
nodes

378
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,079
and we obtained this set of accuracy

379
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,360
after obtaining the the decent accuracy

380
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
we used rcpg and predicted the locality

381
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
of elixir top 5000 websites

382
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,519
and we observed a large fraction

383
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,680
of the alexa top websites to be located

384
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
inside the country and thus

385
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,839
we likely conclude

386
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
that these

387
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,519
traffic localization because of syrian

388
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,959
proliferation

389
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,199
can inadvertently impact various

390
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,000
anti-censorship

391
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,680
approaches we even went a step ahead

392
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,079
and we further classified whether these

393
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,120
websites

394
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,880
are located on cdn or is on non-syrian

395
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,720
infrastructure that is simply a single

396
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,000
hosted server

397
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,880
and if it is a cdn it is dns based or it

398
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,639
is any cost based

399
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,600
as can be seen most of the websites that

400
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
are located inside

401
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
are either anycasted or non ctm and the

402
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,800
ones

403
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,720
that are hosted outside are

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,600
and are also dns based are very less

405
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,320
less than

406
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
uh seven percent and thus

407
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
we say that cache browser and cdn reaper

408
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
might not be used

409
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,480
as they assume that the website should

410
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,600
be hosted on

411
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,440
dns based areas and likely outside

412
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
how we identify the type of cdns and we

413
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
classified the websites

414
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,720
we urge the listeners to

415
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,120
read our paper and find this in detail

416
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
there

417
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
eventually we also took a closer look at

418
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
the notion of nation state hegemony

419
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
that is previous authors reported a

420
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
large fraction of

421
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,199
internet paths to alexa top 1000

422
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,480
websites

423
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,959
originating from underserved countries

424
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,079
either transit

425
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,199
or end in powerful countries like u.s

426
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
however our results paint a different

427
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,199
picture

428
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,759
most of the alexa top of 1000 websites

429
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
are hosted within the countries and even

430
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
the trace road paths

431
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,519
to them also remain localized within the

432
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,199
countries

433
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
we believe that we obtain a different

434
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,240
picture

435
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
because previous authors used

436
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
max mind for ipgeo location that is

437
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,160
known for its inconsistencies

438
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,199
whereas we used multi-literation

439
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,680
and attempted to reduce the geolocation

440
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
errors to our best

441
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
thus we recommend that the clients must

442
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,040
be made

443
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,480
aware of those popular websites

444
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,319
that are hosted outside for

445
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,919
circumvention

446
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,160
and importantly this set should be

447
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,959
monitored

448
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,760
periodically as popular websites are

449
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
being migrated to cdns

450
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,439
day by day and we believe in future

451
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,559
will have a even lesser set of

452
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,119
alexa popular websites that are going to

453
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,880
be hosted within the census regime

454
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
finally i would like to conclude by

455
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
saying

456
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
a large fraction of popular websites are

457
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,160
hosted

458
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
within the country and thus cannot be

459
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
directly used for the fire routing

460
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
and importantly other schemes like

461
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
domain fronting and

462
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,840
covert card covert cast could also be

463
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,559
hampered

464
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,799
as sensors can simply coerce the seeding

465
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,760
providers

466
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,840
to abandon its use eventually we end up

467
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
with a new dilemma

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
traditional solutions are relatively

469
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,120
easy to block

470
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,080
based on the ip addresses whereas newer

471
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,039
solutions

472
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,840
might not work due to the proliferation

473
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,160
of

474
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
cdns with this i would like to end my

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,400
presentation

476
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,200
and thank you
