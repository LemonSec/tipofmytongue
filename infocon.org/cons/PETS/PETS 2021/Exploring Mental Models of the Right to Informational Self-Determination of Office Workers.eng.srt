00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,760
welcome to the talk exploring mental

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,360
models of the right to informational

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,279
self-determination of office workers in

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,240
germany

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
my name is jan tolstov and today i

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,080
present a collaborative work by florian

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
dilling jeffen reinhardt luigi leokuno

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,320
and myself

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
as the title already suggests the

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,520
setting of this talk is the employment

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,119
relationship in germany

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,039
during regular employment employees

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,800
usually disclose large amounts of

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
sensitive personal data to their

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,439
employers

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
in germany this data usually includes

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
the sharing of the social security

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
number bank account information

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
religious affiliation and handicap

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
allowance the ongoing digitization of

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
work processes also means that the

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
volume of data is increasing

23
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,879
and the type of data is becoming more

24
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
diverse this situation

25
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,039
increases employees vulnerability to

26
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
privacy violations

27
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,920
and poses a challenge to the

28
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,520
preservation and protection of the

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
fundamental right to privacy and

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
employment

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
in germany employees privacy is

32
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
protected by the right to informational

33
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
self-determination

34
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,559
this right warrants each individual

35
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,719
transparency and personal control over

36
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,559
the collection news and disclosure of

37
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
personal data in all aspects of life

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
with the advantage of the european

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
general data protection regulation in

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
2018

41
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
they are now also legally binding rules

42
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
for employers to provide tools that

43
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,360
empower employees to exercise the right

44
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,119
to informational self-determination at

45
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,920
work

46
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,680
legislation tries to balance the

47
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,439
difference in power between powerful

48
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,520
data controllers such as employers

49
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,159
and data subjects such as employees by

50
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
making both jointly responsible for

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
privacy protection

52
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
in particular the gdpr resulted in new

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,439
obligations for employers

54
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,759
including but not limited to making

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
transparent which personal data are

56
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
processed and for what purposes

57
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
providing information on risks and

58
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
rights in a way that is comprehensible

59
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,520
to employees

60
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
providing intervention options weighing

61
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
up their interests against employee

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
privacy and protection needs

63
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
for their part employees are expected to

64
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,040
exercise their rights

65
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
we argue that this situation poses a

66
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,240
dilemma

67
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,159
privacy controls which employers have to

68
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,680
provide and guarantee for

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
but which are to be used by employees

70
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
can only protect privacy to the extent

71
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,759
that employees perceptions of their

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,840
rights and obligations are sufficient

73
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
from human computer interaction research

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
it is well known that people's internal

75
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,120
perceptions

76
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
also called mental models of a system in

77
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,080
our case the right to informational

78
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
self-determination

79
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
considerably influenced behavior this

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
poses the threat that if employees had

81
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
false or significantly limited

82
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
perceptions of their privacy rights

83
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,920
simply providing privacy controls would

84
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
reduce the principles of the gdpr to

85
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,959
absurdity

86
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,480
because employees would simply not

87
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
exercise their rights to shed light on

88
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,519
this matter

89
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
we explored the boundaries of the

90
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
perceptions of informational

91
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
self-determination at work

92
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,160
by conducting a mental model study with

93
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
27 office workers in germany

94
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
we focused on three key research topics

95
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
the first topic refers to the perception

96
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
of categories of data

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
and there with associated terminology

98
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
that is

99
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,239
the right to informational

100
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,519
self-determination stipulates different

101
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
rules for the processing of different

102
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
categories of data

103
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
in the employment relationship we have

104
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,159
identified the following six

105
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
terms that are frequently used in

106
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
practice to describe different types of

107
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,400
data

108
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
please note that unlike in english the

109
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
literal translation of personal data

110
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
into german means such data with a

111
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,280
strong

112
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
personal reference and must not be

113
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
confused with the english legal term

114
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,920
personal data

115
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,519
in practice office workers are

116
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
frequently confronted with these terms

117
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,879
when interacting with data protection

118
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,319
guidelines or software

119
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
for example this is a single screenshot

120
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
of an excerpt of a german privacy

121
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
statement of a large office u provider

122
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
in which three different terms are used

123
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
interchangeably the second research

124
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
topic refers to the concept of

125
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
informational self-determination at work

126
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
it is important to note that this right

127
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
is exercised differently in the

128
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,239
employment relationship

129
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,280
than for example in private online use

130
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
this is because the right is not

131
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,640
absolute and is limited by the work

132
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,360
context

133
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
for example data processing is permitted

134
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
without formal consent of employees if

135
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,239
the processing is either essential

136
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,080
or permitted by national law or

137
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
collective agreements

138
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
employers also typically try to avoid

139
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,640
consent

140
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
as it can be very difficult to manage

141
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
consent and practice

142
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
especially because it can be revoked at

143
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
any time transparency rights on the

144
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,639
other hand

145
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
remain largely unaffected and are quite

146
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
extensive at this point we were

147
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
interested in finding out to what extent

148
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
employees were familiar with the concept

149
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
of informational self-determination

150
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
and what requirements for transparency

151
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
and control they derive from it

152
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
last but not least the third research

153
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
topic refers to employees awareness of

154
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
personal data processing

155
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
past studies already revealed that

156
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
online users in particular often have a

157
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,080
poor understanding of the data

158
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
flow and the extent of processing

159
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
activities going on we therefore

160
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
investigated office workers perceptions

161
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
of data storage and data flow but also

162
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,759
explored their beliefs with respect to

163
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
which precise safeguards are implemented

164
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,400
and which threat models exist to explore

165
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
these research topics we conducted a

166
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,759
mental model study based on

167
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
semi-structured interviews and proceeded

168
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,400
as follows

169
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
to derive the interview guidelines we

170
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
carried out an expert model approach

171
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
with an iterative design

172
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
for this we first reviewed legal text

173
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
and related work to extract different

174
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
themes of informational

175
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
self-determination and organize them

176
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
into groups

177
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,039
we then conducted two expert group

178
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
sessions with researchers from law

179
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
psychology ergonomics i.t systems as

180
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,919
well as security and privacy to revise

181
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,919
and fine-tune the model we then derived

182
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,520
interview guidelines from the model and

183
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
revised them with researchers experience

184
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
in conducting interviews

185
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,039
we also conducted three pilot interviews

186
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
with office workers to fine-tune the

187
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,919
questions and wording

188
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,600
in the interview we first asked

189
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
participants to explain the six

190
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
different terms

191
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
and provide examples with relation to

192
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
the job we then discuss

193
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
all sorts of issues related to

194
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,120
transparency and control over personal

195
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,400
data and employment

196
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
concluding with a question of what

197
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
informational self-determination means

198
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,479
to them we then asked how certain data

199
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,160
were processed by their employer

200
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,560
and emphasized on the involved processes

201
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
potential threats

202
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
and safeguards that participants

203
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
believed to exist finally

204
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
respondents filled out a demographic

205
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
questionnaire at the end of the

206
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,639
interview

207
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,800
the interviews lasted between 30 to 90

208
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
minutes and were analyzed using an

209
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,800
inductive coding approach by two coders

210
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,759
in total we recruited 27 employees from

211
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,440
nine different organizations of

212
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,319
different size

213
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
we had a balanced sex distribution and

214
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,120
participants age range between 24 and 58

215
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,680
years

216
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,759
typical for office workers the level of

217
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
education our sample was relatively high

218
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
since the minimal educational level was

219
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
secondary school and 17 participants

220
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
even held an academic degree

221
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
for our analysis we divided our

222
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
participants into three groups of

223
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
different professional backgrounds and

224
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
experience with data processing

225
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
the first group comprise administration

226
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
employees who were mainly concerned with

227
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
the management of financial resources

228
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,319
and project controlling

229
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,919
the second group comprise computer

230
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,680
scientists and software developers from

231
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,960
security engineering

232
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
requirements engineering and b2b

233
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
software the third group comprise

234
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
employees with activities

235
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
other than the processing of personal

236
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
data and without a computer science

237
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,240
background

238
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
five participants held a management or

239
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,759
leadership position at the time of the

240
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,560
interviews

241
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
let us now have a look at our results

242
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
with respect to terminology and the

243
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,639
perception of categories of data our

244
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,400
results are somewhat ambivalent

245
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
on the one hand the answers we received

246
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
indicate that the terms evoke adequate

247
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,800
associations in a broader sense

248
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
in our coding we identified recurring

249
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
themes in the participants explanations

250
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
based on these themes participants

251
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
distinguish between three broader

252
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
concepts the

253
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
first concept arises from data and

254
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
information and largely lacks privacy

255
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,199
related attributes

256
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,960
these terms were described relating to

257
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
data that have no direct personal

258
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
reference but are very relevant for

259
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
daily work

260
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,319
the second group arises from pai and iri

261
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
and symbolizes data with clear personal

262
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
references participants explained that

263
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
such data identify them uniquely

264
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
either directly or because one could

265
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,039
also infer the identity from such data

266
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
the third concept is defined by private

267
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,280
data and symbolizes data with no

268
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
business relevance and strong access

269
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,319
restrictions

270
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
on the other hand however we received

271
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,479
most contradicting statements about the

272
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:06,879
term

273
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,599
personal data a quota of participants

274
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,520
claimed that it had no reference to a

275
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,240
person

276
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
whereas another quarter claimed that

277
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,000
this data directly concerned a person in

278
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
the identity

279
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
i would like to remind that this does

280
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
not refer to the english term personal

281
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
data used by the gdpr

282
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,759
but data emphasizing the personal

283
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
reference moreover

284
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
half of participants explicitly asked

285
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
for clarification or stated that they

286
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
strivel to identify meaningful

287
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,039
differences between these six terms

288
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,559
apart from the legal meaning though

289
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,559
participants intuitively refer to

290
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
different privacy boundaries and the

291
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
explanations of the different terms

292
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
here the assumed business relevance

293
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
played a decisive role for whether data

294
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,920
belonged to the public or private sphere

295
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
this was associated with expectations of

296
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
control and claims to ownership however

297
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
participants made conflicting

298
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,160
assumptions about privacy spheres

299
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
ownership and control for the same data

300
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
concepts possible consequences of the

301
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
identified lack of familiarity with

302
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,839
these terms legal meanings favors

303
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,600
unintended privacy turbulences

304
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
either because employees access data

305
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,279
without authorization

306
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
or incorrectly assume no access because

307
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
they do not understand the privacy rules

308
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
we therefore conclude that the use of

309
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
common terms is likely to leave office

310
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
workers in an uninformed state since

311
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
they are unaware of the rights and

312
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
obligations that actually apply to them

313
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
let us now turn to the second research

314
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,040
topic the concept of the right to

315
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
informational self-determination at work

316
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
we divided the aspects discussed by our

317
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
participants into four thematic

318
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
categories

319
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
based on these four categories we then

320
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
conducted a hierarchical clustering

321
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,080
analysis to examine correlations among

322
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
our participants

323
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,440
we identified a meaningful three-cluster

324
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
solution we

325
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,399
refer to the first group as privacy

326
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,440
doctrinarists

327
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
the group comprises eight participants

328
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
who demanded the unrestricted validity

329
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
of the right to informational

330
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
self-determination at work

331
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240
requiring full control over the

332
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
processing of personal data

333
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
in addition they partially recognized

334
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
the value of exposed control

335
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
and they were also the only group that

336
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
recognized transparency as an important

337
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
key aspect of privacy

338
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,680
emphasis was put on information about

339
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
which personal data are stored

340
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,760
and who has access to data the control

341
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
seeking pragmatists formed the second

342
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:13,920
group

343
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
comprising 10 participants for them

344
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
informational self-determination

345
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
was tantamount to control over the

346
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
disclosure of personal data

347
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
mental models were characterized by the

348
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
primary goal of limiting disclosure to

349
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
absolutely necessary data

350
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
they defined self-determination as the

351
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,279
key element of privacy

352
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
and required employers to respect

353
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
decisions to withhold data

354
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
though they tended to accept limitations

355
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
to privacy due to employment

356
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
the third group comprises nine

357
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
participants and is referred to as data

358
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,360
flow concerned protectionists they had a

359
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,079
strong desire

360
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,920
to protect their privacy outside the

361
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,000
organization we found strong claims

362
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
towards an ability to gain control over

363
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
the forwarding of data by employers and

364
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
the audience to whom personal data was

365
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,959
closed

366
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,880
they demanded to be asked for explicit

367
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
consent and expected full control over

368
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
the processing of data

369
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
nevertheless some mental models also

370
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
show traits of accepting restrictions

371
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
furthermore participants discussed

372
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,160
issues of mental load

373
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
they noticed the high cognitive demand

374
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
that was necessary to truly capture the

375
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
complexity of self-determined privacy

376
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,360
decisions

377
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
and pointed out the associated time-time

378
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
costs managing privacy they also pointed

379
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
out the limitations of current privacy

380
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,440
controls in many situations

381
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
for example they felt powerless either

382
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,720
because there was

383
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
no way of saying no to data processing

384
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,279
or because they were unsatisfied with

385
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,560
the controls they have

386
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
in particular they complained about the

387
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
insufficiency of privacy settings

388
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
to conclude our findings our

389
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
investigation reveals that informational

390
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,640
self-determination at work is associated

391
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
with different meanings objectives and

392
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,200
problems

393
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
while our findings are consistent with

394
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,639
previous work highlighting the

395
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,560
importance of control over the gathering

396
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
and handling of personal data

397
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
our results also indicate that

398
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,000
transparency can be another important

399
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,800
dimension

400
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
however despite discussing aspects of

401
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
transparency with all participants

402
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
our analysis does not provide an answer

403
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
as to why two clauses ignore

404
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,839
transparency as a key element of privacy

405
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,800
nevertheless

406
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
their strong claims for acts and control

407
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
might actually reflect a lack of

408
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,320
transparency in the work context

409
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
which is compensated for by considering

410
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,079
the moment of disclosure as the most

411
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,839
important control point for privacy

412
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,639
protection

413
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
since work context civilian restricts

414
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
employees rights towards acts under

415
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,200
control

416
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
it is probably fair to assume that

417
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,800
office workers also perceive their right

418
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,720
to informational self-determination as

419
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
civilly restricted in practice

420
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,399
if their mental models are focused

421
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
exclusively on self-determination

422
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
let us now have a look at the last

423
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
research topic participants generally

424
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
believe that the master data that is

425
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
close to their employers such as bank

426
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
details and private address were stored

427
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,959
in digital

428
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,040
and analog paper format for digital

429
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
copies they pointed out that such

430
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
data resided on an unmanageable amount

431
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,279
of databases and end user devices

432
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,920
inside and outside the organization also

433
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
because such data are often available in

434
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,079
transmission media such as emails

435
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,320
for metadata such as phone records

436
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
almost all respondents were uncertain as

437
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,040
to whether

438
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
and if so where this data would be

439
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
stored for example

440
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
non-it saw speculated that phone records

441
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
were stored directly in the phone itself

442
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,639
they also reacted with surprise at their

443
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,560
own ignorance and most respondents

444
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
including managers had no ideas about

445
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,480
who could actually access these records

446
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,320
within the organization and which

447
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
details were stored

448
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,440
concerning the processing of data in the

449
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
course of payroll preparation

450
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
respondents had difficulties in clearly

451
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
identifying the recipients of their data

452
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
and were unsure which data were actually

453
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
made available to whom

454
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
let us now turn to the safeguards and

455
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,839
threat models that our participants

456
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,800
believed to exist

457
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
nine participants explicitly stated that

458
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
they were completely unaware of the

459
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
extent to which safeguards existed for

460
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,079
personal data

461
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,920
and also expressed displeasure in

462
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
realizing their knowledge gaps

463
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
yet the vast majority identified a

464
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
functioning authorization concept in the

465
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
form of role-based access control within

466
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
the organization as the most important

467
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,199
safeguard

468
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,800
technical layman in particular

469
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
associated strong security convictions

470
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,920
with the safeguard

471
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
as the ultimate gatekeeper

472
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
administrative and i.t staff

473
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,720
also stress the importance of

474
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
appropriate procedural measures to

475
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,680
clearly assign rights and

476
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,959
responsibilities

477
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,800
it was followed by beliefs in the solid

478
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
authentication system

479
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,000
and the protection of data in transit

480
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
and at rest through encryption and lock

481
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,160
bins

482
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
for threat models the interception of

483
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
paper communication was considered the

484
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
easiest and most likely attack vector to

485
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,800
obtain

486
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,279
unauthorized access to data especially

487
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,480
in the payroll process

488
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,839
we found that our participants

489
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,680
identified hackers and their colleagues

490
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
as the most likely adversaries with

491
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
similar high mentions they claimed that

492
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,519
colleagues posed a great threat to

493
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,160
privacy

494
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,519
since they were considered either

495
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,600
vulnerable to socializing attacks

496
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,399
or inattentive and callous or evil super

497
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,920
administrators who could easily

498
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
circumvent technical safeguards and

499
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
access all data

500
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,519
to conclude our participants put a lot

501
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
of trust in digital data processing

502
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,040
and in the infrastructure of the

503
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,360
employers they were also generally aware

504
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,199
of the processing of data in various

505
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,160
processes

506
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
however they were unsure of the exact

507
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
personal data being processed and the

508
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,240
entities involved in the processing

509
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
also next to hackers colleagues are

510
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
perceived as a threat to privacy

511
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
we now come to the conclusion of our

512
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
study our examination reveals a variety

513
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
of issues of the perceptions

514
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
concepts and awareness of the right to

515
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
informational self-determination and

516
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,199
work

517
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,720
that could hinder employees from

518
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
exercising it to practice

519
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
the most obvious boundaries are the

520
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,240
one-dimensional views of this right as

521
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,000
mir-x and control and the lack of

522
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
awareness of personal data processing

523
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
to help employees identify the presence

524
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,560
of personal data and the rules for

525
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,959
processing that apply to specific data

526
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
we advocate using explicit descriptions

527
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
rather than terminology that evokes

528
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,959
inconsistent and contradictory

529
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
associations

530
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,720
for this employers may refer to the

531
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
themes we identified

532
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
concerning risk awareness our

533
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,320
investigation suggests that employees

534
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
trust their employers with their data

535
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
while this is good news for employers

536
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
this trust relationships run to the risk

537
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,160
of being civilly disrupted

538
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,839
in the event of a data protection

539
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,720
incident to prevent disillusionment and

540
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,440
counteract

541
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,519
uncertainty it should be an employer's

542
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
best interest to enhance the mental

543
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
models of employees

544
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
and further strengthen the trust culture

545
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
by making personal data processing more

546
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,839
transparent

547
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,680
and provide details on the involved

548
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
entities and the scope of safeguards

549
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
for control there appears to be a

550
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
disparity between the high demands for x

551
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
and the control that we found

552
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,240
and the degree of control that the legal

553
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
framework and the work contracts allow

554
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
we hypothesize that this bias results

555
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
from the privacy controls available in

556
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,600
practice

557
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
which appear to be characterized by x

558
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,320
and control outside the work context

559
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,160
yet it is questionable whether the

560
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
provision of acts under control would be

561
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,959
helpful

562
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,639
because controls to which people are

563
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,399
accustomed do not seem to meet their

564
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,600
expectations

565
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
this suggests that employees privacy

566
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
actually benefits from current practice

567
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,160
of dispensing with consent in the work

568
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,880
on text

569
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,679
because free consent is too burdensome

570
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,400
also

571
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,720
despite scientific and legal efforts to

572
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,959
provide transparency enhancing tools

573
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,199
their value to the right to privacy and

574
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
their potential to reduce the burden of

575
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
privacy management

576
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,359
must also be promoted in the future for

577
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,439
future research on privacy at work

578
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,000
we recommend to take into consideration

579
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
trust in affiliated parties such as

580
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
customers or external processes

581
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,320
trust and colleagues and i.t staff as

582
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
well as employees assumptions on

583
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
implemented safeguards

584
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
quantitative research in particular

585
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
could include them as control variables

586
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
or antecedents to explore their impact

587
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
on employees privacy perceptions

588
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,840
thank you for your attention
