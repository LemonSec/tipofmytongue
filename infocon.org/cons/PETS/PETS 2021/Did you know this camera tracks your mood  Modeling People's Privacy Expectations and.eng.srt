hello everybody my name is aaron zhang i

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,679
am a phd student

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,120
in the school of computer science at

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,879
carnegie mellon university

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
today i'll present our work on did you

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
know this camera tracks your mood

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
understanding privacy expectations and

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
preferences in the age of video

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,239
analytics

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,000
this work is in collaboration with the

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
union fung william bauer lori crainer

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
ann palmdas and norman sade his work is

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,119
part of the personalized privacy

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,080
assistance project

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,439
an estimate of one billion cameras will

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,760
be in use globally by the end of this

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,559
year

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,320
the massive amount of video data

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
captured by these cameras motivates the

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,120
deployment

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,600
of video analytics technologies which

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
use computer software to automatically

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,079
process

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
and understand videos such technologies

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,039
have been greatly improved due to recent

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
advances in deep learning and computer

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,079
vision

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,440
and they're becoming increasingly

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,280
sophisticated

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
such software can be easily applied to

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
real-time ip cameras

32
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,920
or store footage from any cameras those

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,640
analysis

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,799
often happen without subjects awareness

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
or consent

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,439
recent privacy regulations like the gdpr

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,520
general data protection regulation

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,200
and ccpa california consumer privacy act

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
included stricter laws to govern the use

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,080
of video analytics technologies

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,240
the regulations require entities that

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
use vital analytics to notify data

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,040
subjects

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
and enable them to opt in or out of some

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
practices at or before the point of data

46
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,439
collection

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
there are currently no standard ways to

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
notify data subjects that video

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,479
analytics is in use

50
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
some entities would put up signs like

51
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
this and even when

52
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
signs are in place many people fail to

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
notice them

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,439
additionally such notice mechanisms are

55
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,399
insufficient

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
because important information about the

57
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
data collection

58
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,479
like what type of analysis is being used

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,320
how long the footage is retained

60
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,079
whether the information could be shared

61
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,159
with other entities or the purpose of

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,119
data collection

63
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,759
is often not available to data subjects

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
the gap between the current disclosure

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,040
practices

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,758
and the requirements of the regulations

67
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,520
draws our attention to the lack of

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
guidance

69
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
on how to do a better job at

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
communicating those data practices

71
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
to data subjects and also enabling them

72
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
to exercise the privacy rights

73
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
like opt-in or opt-out granted to them

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
by those regulations

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
in order to facilitate appropriate

76
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
notice and choice

77
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
about these different types of video

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
analytics deployments

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,920
we first want to understand people's

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
privacy expectations and preferences

81
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,040
with regard to these deployments we

82
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,959
asked the following research question

83
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,120
do people know about these deployments

84
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
and how do people feel about them

85
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,519
especially we're interested in people

86
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,879
surprise level

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
whether they expect these practices at

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
certain places or not

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
their comfort level their notification

90
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,840
preference

91
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
meaning whether they like to be notified

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,879
or not

93
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
and if yes how often they want to be

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,080
notified

95
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
we're also interested in in whether

96
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
people would allow or deny those

97
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
practices

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,879
if given the choice with these research

99
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,840
questions in mind

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
we design an experienced sampling study

101
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
the experience link sampling method

102
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
is a research methodology which enables

103
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
us to engage and survey participants

104
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
in the moment as they go about their

105
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
normal daily lives

106
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,799
as a result this method allows us to

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,319
collect higher quality

108
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
more ecologically valid research data

109
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,640
than static online surveys

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,760
in total we surveyed 123 participants

111
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
and collected detailed responses for

112
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
more than 2 300 deployment scenarios

113
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
when recruiting we try to avoid

114
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
convenient samples of students

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
and to reach out to the local community

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
we ended up with a rather diverse sample

117
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,680
here is a table showing all the

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
different occupations of our

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
participants and their respective

120
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
percentages we first did an extensive

121
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,360
survey of news articles about real world

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
deployments of video analytics

123
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
technologies

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
we identified four major categories in a

125
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
variety of contexts

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
the first category is for security which

127
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
includes automatically detecting petty

128
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,319
crime scenes

129
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
like pocketing break-ins and also

130
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,238
includes

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,639
using middle analytics to identify known

132
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,199
criminals and bad actors

133
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
the second important type is for

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
commercial uses it's been used to count

135
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,880
the number of people in a facility

136
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
in order to optimize operations like

137
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
staff management

138
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
or it is used for targeted advertising

139
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
based on demographics

140
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
individual profiles or reactions when

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
people are looking at items in stores

142
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
as it has also been used to rate

143
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
people's engagement

144
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,560
at museums movie theaters and comedy

145
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
clubs

146
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
the third key usage revolves around

147
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,440
identification

148
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
and authentication visual recognition

149
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
can be used

150
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,759
to replace work ids membership and

151
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,960
loyalty cards

152
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
it has also been used to track

153
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
attendance at gyms schools workplaces

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,479
and even churches

155
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
the last category is more advanced

156
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,960
facial recognition and emotion analysis

157
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
can be used by health insurance

158
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,960
providers or hospitals and

159
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
doctors to make health related

160
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,199
predictions and also by employers who

161
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,080
evaluate

162
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
employee performance and model their

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,759
productivity

164
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
in total we identified 15 unique

165
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
purposes and one baseline which involves

166
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
only generic surveillance with no video

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,479
analytics involved

168
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
here i'm going to briefly explain the

169
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
study protocol

170
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
people will see a recruitment ad and

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,400
sign up for the study if they're

172
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,039
interested

173
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,280
by filling out a screening survey

174
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
afterwards they receive an email with

175
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,080
instructions

176
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
and a link to download the study app via

177
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
the google play store

178
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,520
participants downloaded and installed

179
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,160
the app on their own android devices

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
the app first asked them to fill in a

181
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
pre-survey

182
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
where we asked them general questions

183
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
about their perceptions and knowledge of

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
facial recognition

185
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
after that participants were instructed

186
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
to go about their

187
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
daily regular data activities and the

188
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,919
app sent them push notifications

189
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,680
prompting them to complete a short

190
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,319
survey

191
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
based on their current locations because

192
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
the gps location indoors is not precise

193
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,560
enough sometimes

194
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
when they are answering their surveys

195
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,919
participants first confirmed the place

196
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,039
they were at

197
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,440
by selecting from a drop down list of

198
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
near all nearby places

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,520
after they selected the location they

200
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
were at the app displayed a video

201
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,919
analytics deployment scenario

202
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,840
relevant to the place they were visiting

203
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,759
for example this screenshot shows an

204
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
example scenario

205
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,680
of a bank using facial recognition to

206
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
automatically detect

207
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,319
known criminals and bad actors

208
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
participants then answer in-situ

209
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
multiple choice questions about their

210
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,639
surprise level

211
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
comfort level and notification

212
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
preference

213
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
on the days participants received push

214
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,599
notification through the app

215
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,520
they also got an email in the evening to

216
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
complete a daily summary

217
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
this summary asked participants to

218
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
revisit notifications they received

219
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,240
during the day and

220
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,039
explain their earlier choices in details

221
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,759
and provide

222
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
additional responses this process will

223
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,639
happen for 10 days

224
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,960
and participants finish the study with a

225
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
post survey

226
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
we also interviewed 10 participants

227
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
now i'm moving on to some of the results

228
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
we found in the study

229
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
due to the length of the presentation

230
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
only showing some of the results

231
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
as more can be found in our paper our

232
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,039
study revealed

233
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
that individuals privacy preferences are

234
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
diverse

235
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,960
here is a summary of participants

236
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,919
comfort levels

237
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,080
organized around the 16 different

238
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,440
purposes they previously identified

239
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,360
here the non means this data practice is

240
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
anonymous and id means this data

241
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
practice is identifiable

242
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
from this graph it is clear to us there

243
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
is no scenario where

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
everybody feels uniformly about

245
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
people's responses vary for each purpose

246
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,080
for instance for instance participants

247
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
tend to feel more comfortable with

248
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,560
scenarios related to security

249
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
close to 70 percent would feel somewhat

250
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,039
or very comfortable

251
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
with these scenarios on the other end of

252
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,120
the spectrum we observed considerably

253
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
less comfort

254
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
associated with advanced scenarios like

255
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,960
health and productivity predictions

256
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,199
where about 70 percent of the time

257
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,039
participants feel somewhat were very

258
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,159
uncomfortable this shows that just

259
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
telling people that video analytics is

260
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,120
in use

261
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,679
it's simply not sufficient since

262
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,958
individuals preferences

263
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,200
vary based on the different purposes

264
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
involved

265
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
one thing that surprised us a little is

266
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
more people

267
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,959
were feeling very uncomfortable with

268
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,720
anonymous at targeting based on

269
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
demographic features

270
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,440
than at targeting based on identified

271
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
individual records

272
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
as participants saw demographic based ad

273
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,279
targeting

274
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
as a form of profiling

275
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
this is a summary of participants

276
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,160
notification preferences levels

277
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
organized around the 16 different

278
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,640
purposes we previously identified

279
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
similar similar to what we have seen

280
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
with the comfort levels

281
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,200
their notification preferences also vary

282
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
based on different purposes

283
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
and seem to be rather complex for

284
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
example for purposes like generic

285
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
surveillance

286
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
and attendance tracking we see a similar

287
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,959
percentage of notifications

288
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
which is about a third where people want

289
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
to be notified every time

290
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
even though in the comfort level graph

291
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that we just saw

292
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
we found that participants felt a lot

293
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
less comfortable with

294
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
attendance tracking than security

295
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
scenarios it's partly because people

296
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
were at their workplaces quite often

297
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
and they generally do not always want to

298
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
be notified every time

299
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
it is also natural to explore the

300
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
possible relationships between these

301
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
four variables

302
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,399
we compiled pairwise correlations

303
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,360
between these four

304
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
variables across the 2300 scenarios

305
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
collected in our study

306
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
we used spearmint bank correlation with

307
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
bombardier corrected p-values

308
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
we found a significant relatively strong

309
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,240
correlation

310
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
between surprise and comfort levels we

311
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
also found a significant strong

312
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,079
correlation

313
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,720
between comfort level and whether

314
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
participants would allow

315
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,839
or deny a given scenario people deny

316
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
practices that they do not feel

317
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,959
comfortable about

318
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
people do not feel comfortable with

319
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
practices that they are surprised by

320
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,519
these results are consistent with prior

321
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,880
research

322
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,160
on the other hand we also observe

323
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,079
that correlation between allowed denied

324
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,560
decisions and the desire to be notified

325
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,839
seems nearly negligible it seems that

326
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,760
notification preferences

327
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
is rather distinct from allow deny

328
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
preferences

329
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
it could potentially because

330
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
notification preferences are more

331
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,000
complex

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
and involve other factors such as the

333
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
frequency at which

334
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,160
participants visit those places

335
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
our study reviewed the general lack of

336
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,800
awareness of the possible deployments of

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
video analytics technologies

338
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
among 74 out of 123 which is

339
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
60 of the participants who reported

340
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
they were previously not aware that

341
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
video analytics could be used for so

342
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,839
many different purposes

343
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,079
as such a diverse set of venues and with

344
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
this level of sophistication

345
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
one participant commented some of the

346
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
scenarios and growth of the technology

347
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,600
you mentioned

348
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,399
i had never considered freaked me out

349
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
participants expressed concerns about

350
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,200
specific

351
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,920
usage of these technologies for instance

352
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
one said

353
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,000
i didn't realize i could be marketed to

354
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,519
based on what i'm looking at in the

355
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,560
store

356
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
i found the whole practice disconcerting

357
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
we also see participants who learn the

358
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,760
benefits of this technology

359
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
became more accepting one said

360
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,240
in the beginning i was very

361
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
uncomfortable however as the scenarios

362
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,839
came up in the study

363
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,920
i realized it could be helpful in my

364
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
life

365
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
now we move on to the results about how

366
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,480
notification preferences have

367
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
changed over time we asked participants

368
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
how would you like to be notified the

369
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
choices range from

370
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
don't notify me to notify me every time

371
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,839
this graph shows how their preferences

372
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,120
change before and after the study

373
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
more than half about 55 ended up with

374
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
different preferences

375
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
also at the end of the study the

376
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,959
majority of participants are looking for

377
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,200
some type of selective notifications

378
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
solution instead of being notified every

379
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,639
time

380
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,120
we also observe that participants opt

381
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
for less frequent notifications

382
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
as time passed during the 10-day study

383
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
the descending line in this graph shows

384
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,839
participants

385
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
willingness to be notified decreased

386
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
this change is this changing preferences

387
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
is attributed to some level of

388
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
notification fatigue

389
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
as people got a better appreciation for

390
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
the number of times they are likely to

391
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
be notified

392
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,600
as one participant described i think at

393
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
first when i started

394
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,200
i was saying once in a while and then i

395
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
realized that would be really annoying

396
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
to get multiple notifications

397
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
one other participant described their

398
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
fear for privacy fatigue

399
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
they said i'd definitely be reminded

400
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,720
through the app

401
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,399
the cameras with facial recognition are

402
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,320
used in many many places

403
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
i've become desensitized to this

404
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
practice and in fact what i considered

405
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
in some ways to be negative

406
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,920
because i want my privacy

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,440
here are some examples of how existing

408
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,160
notice mechanisms work in california

409
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,680
where entities are required by

410
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
regulations to inform data subject

411
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,480
data collection that is happening for

412
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,120
example

413
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,920
one restaurant provides consumers this

414
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,519
privacy notice

415
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
and give them instructions to visit

416
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
their privacy policies for

417
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,600
more details and to exercise their

418
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
privacy rights

419
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,160
another example is shown on the right

420
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,560
where

421
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,519
a plague notice which is at knee level

422
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,160
at a gadget store in san francisco

423
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
when you accidentally came across this

424
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
plaque and scanned its qr code

425
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
you will find that stepping inside the

426
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,360
store puts you in range

427
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
of cameras equipped with video analytics

428
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
software that estimates your age

429
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,760
and gender this is clearly not

430
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
transparency

431
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,560
and people would like to be more

432
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
informed when their facial data is being

433
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,760
collected

434
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
than this current option shown on the

435
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
right

436
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
however imagine if you live in

437
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
california and every place you go

438
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
give you a notice like the one on the

439
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
left these things can become

440
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
overwhelming easily and it's also

441
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
impractical to expect the

442
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
data subject to actually type in

443
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,120
the address for privacy policies and

444
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
exercise their privacy rights

445
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
because since even with our 10-day study

446
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,279
we already observed notification and

447
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,040
privacy fatigue

448
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,279
our study highlights important needs to

449
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
improve the current notice and choice

450
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,320
mechanisms

451
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,199
that many entities rely on especially we

452
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:33,680
should

453
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
reconsider how notice and choice work

454
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
with regard to video analytics

455
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,079
technologies

456
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,160
one way is to inform data subjects

457
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
important details

458
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
about the deployments for example the

459
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
purposes involved

460
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,320
or the types of analytics used

461
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
because all these factors seem to have

462
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,320
impact on individuals privacy

463
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
preferences

464
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
another way is to provide more usable

465
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,600
ways

466
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
to allow data subjects to exercise their

467
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,279
privacy

468
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,720
choices as granted by regulations

469
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
one potential solution that came out of

470
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,959
this privacy assistant project group

471
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
is to build a privacy infrastructure and

472
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
a privacy assistant app

473
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,160
for the internet of things such an app

474
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
running on people's smartphones would

475
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
alert users of nearby

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
iot sensors for example cameras with

477
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,600
video analytics software is enabled

478
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
and present them with potential privacy

479
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
choices like

480
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,279
opt-in or opt-out users can also specify

481
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,079
the desired notification frequencies and

482
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,839
choose the types of data

483
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,600
that they would want to be notified

484
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
about

485
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
because of the increasingly widespread

486
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,160
deployment of data analytics software

487
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
this could result in an unrealistic

488
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
unrealistically high number of privacy

489
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,240
notice

490
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
and decisions

491
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,839
the high user burden remains a problem

492
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
and could be a potential future research

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,040
direction

494
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,679
this concludes my presentation there is

495
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,679
also a sister publication that will

496
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,599
appear in soups this august

497
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
which focuses on the qualitative

498
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
exploration of privacy concerns and

499
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,079
attitudes about facial recognition and

500
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
video analytics which complements the

501
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,799
quantitative analysis of data presented

502
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,520
here

503
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,359
please check it out if you're interested

504
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,559
thank you
