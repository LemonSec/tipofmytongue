1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
um great so uh as you can see this is

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,760
the

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,799
uh uh the way to vote um we're gonna use

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,000
mentee.com

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
people use it last year and you might

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,440
use it during teaching or whatever

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
um just go to that website and enter

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,199
this code at the top 9706 7747 you can

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,800
do it on your phone

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,640
um you can do it on your computer you

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
can do it i mean whatever your palm

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,760
pilot

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
um and uh the way it works is it's a

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,320
ranked vote

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,679
so actually you can rank as many as you

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,920
want and feel free definitely to do that

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
um from from one to six um and the first

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,480
place gets the most points in second

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
place to get second points and so on and

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,719
we'll

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
um let give everyone about

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
uh three minutes to vote i think um

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,280
so until about 36 um so everyone can log

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,480
in there and let me know if you've got

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,840
any problems

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
and we can see how to fix them and then

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
i'll reveal the results

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,480
i can see the number going up at the

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,120
corner so whatever's happening

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:13,840
it exists

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
and remember the best talk award will be

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,280
a real award

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,000
which cve from cnn is joel's talk

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
i guess while you're all voting i should

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
take this opportunity to

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
i probably should have had a graphic for

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
this or something but there will be a

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
physical prize

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
sent to whoever is the winner of this

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
voting and that physical prize was very

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
generously donated by

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
my own institution specifically the

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
institute for security privacy and

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,959
information assurance at the university

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,479
of calgary so

46
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
thanks to to me or us or them or

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,840
whatever you want to say

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
so this vote is in no way guaranteed to

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,080
be secure or verifiable or even

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
we really with a with a clear algorithm

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
that sorts the votes

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,760
um but that's okay because

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,599
everyone's trusted here at hot pets

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
just don't use more than one device be a

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
good sport we'll have no way of stopping

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
like i told michael i don't think anyone

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
will storm the capital over the outcome

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
of this vote

60
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
they have no revocation like the

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
european digital covert certificates

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
no method of revocation has been built

63
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
in this system

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
great okay so it is 36.

65
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,800

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319

and see what happens

68

69

70
